So, yeah, so

Bills can get paid off of rappin', still I keep to trappin'
Used to hunnid sack it, now I fuck an actress
Shit, I'm just thinkin' how it happened
Had to get explicit, had to make it listen
Moving out them pounds, niggas started snitchin'
Loading up them rounds, niggas started missin'
Move it out of town, and Tommy Cruise the mission
Converse with my addictions, don't talk I just listen
Five drugs that I'm mixin', money only thing on my vision
Infatuated with them semi's and 'matics
All of my niggas is thugs with some habits
Like grandma TV, we been with the static
I fuck on this bitch and she say she from Athens
Opiated so I'm demonstratin' my emotion less
Got some real niggas quotin' this, got yo' main bitch hoein shit
Lost a few things as of recent, life is anything but decent
Blow the re-up on my teeth, it's the only time you catch me cheesin'
It's Dolla

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Shipping a pack and it's vacuum sealed
30 on 40, keep that concealed
Just bought a pint, I'm a crack the seal
Strap on my side like a Navy SEAL
Three in the morning, we trapping still
Matte black on rover, the Batmobile
Don’t trust that nigga cause he gon squeal
Not buying shit if the pack not sealed
I'm faded, I’m faded, off xannies I’m wasted
My bitches they nasty, they suck it and taste it
I’m short on my patience, I’m serving my patient
I’m very impatient, little bitch come get naked
Pack coming in but I don’t need to weigh it
Choppa en route, I shoot once and you spraying
Can’t come in my trap, the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Dripping through the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot cause she heard me on the radio
3 bitches, one of me, that's a perfect ratio
Don’t wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio
Let her play with the nut, put it in her booty hole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo
Stuffed cup, backwoods, riding 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to po'
Hit a stain, hogging lanes, gripping grain, getting throwed
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe
No holds barred when you see me, Imma let it go
No mo' 'gars so we rolling up the fronto
No mo 'gars cause we rollin out the fronto
I'm in H-town, nigga, and I can never go

[Hook]
Audi, Bimmer, Benz with the roof up
Still on this goop punch, three gram, boof blunt
High as fuck
Called up some hoes, "Let's go to Lenox Square"
Might just go icey my wrist, might just go cop me some squares
Keep a small circle, I can't fuck with squares
Ay I had to get it how I got it, nigga life ain't fair
Spilt that lean all on my kicks and got another pair
I say fuck them two hoes man, I got another pair, bitch
Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi
Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi

[Bridge]
Why should I keep juggin' all these broke boys?
In the mall buying ice cause he's a broke boi
I can't even kick it with these broke boys
He ain't come to buy a pack cause he a broke boi

[Verse]
Bitch I'm going through the sack cause I'm no broke boi
Runnin' up the check on these broke boys
Put some bands on your neck and have you murked boy
Bitch I'm ballin' on these niggas, ballin'
Bitch I'm ballin' on these niggas, first they hatin' "he's so pussy"
Don't cross your partner, pussy, that's a pussy for some pussy
Always talked about me, still ain't never shook me
I'm a real nigga from the Flat can't overlook me
1500 nigga if you're tryna come and book me
Niggas gonna fuckin' book me
Keep that choppa on me, my grandma watchin' me
Fuck my Jesus piece, I might squeeze the piece
Hold out on my way, I might flood the streets
And I'm on this lean, I won't make a scene
Nigga front on me, I'mma make a scene
Run up in his shit, run up in his shit

New choppa, new choppa it came with the beam
Actavist pouring up lean

Diamonds they lookin' like ice, I whip the hoe like I'm Ike
Stack up my cash I got height, take advantage of the Sprite
Take the bando bring the hype

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I roll up an L in the lobby
My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a chopper chop you if you try me bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky you bodied this", that's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being boujee by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us, hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas run up the racks, for the most part
"I rap," when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus
It's A$AP and I ain't wanna rush

[Hook: Playboi Carti + A$AP Rocky]
Run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up

Bitch you talk too much, call my phone too much, then I hit ignore
Carti hit me up, said, "I got the twins", boy I hit 'em raw
I do not shop at the mall, but I do flex in the mall
I keep my stick in the car
I take my nine to the mall, I take my nine to the mall

And you see young Carti go

[Outro]
We so proud of him

[Verse]
Hol'up, who that bangin' on my door?

Hold up, don't be blowin' up my phone
Sounding like a little hoe, about some coke you fucking hoe
It's Cartier, these diamonds let you niggas know
You see these 100's , these 100's, nigga we blow
Fuck her under covers, my nigga until the morn'
She say, Carti why you actin' funny?
Ever since you got some money, you been frontin' on me

Damn! You let the lean get you so gone
Don't let the drugs get you so gone

[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Unh, money bags
Bags, nigga cash, splur
Money bags nigga, ey

[Bridge: ThouxanbandFauni]
Bling bling bling my language not no chit-chat
I pull up to the Fendi shorty splur on this and that
The taste you tastin' in her mouth that's just my aftermath
You say you counted seven stacks but I done spended that
Don't hit my line with all that hot shit just say that I need that
I see these niggas plottin', they don't even know I'm strapped

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
Unh, splur, splur, splur, splur, splur

Young nigga juggin' on the flat
Young nigga juggin' had to get it back

And a young nigga tryna make a shade
Young nigga, every day I'm gettin' baked
Young nigga juggin' in LA
Young nigga cool in ghetto shades

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
Unh, splur, splur, splur, splur, splur

She say, Fauni you ain't shit except for this and that
I put my dick out on that bitch, she started kissin' that
And if you ain't talkin' bout bread boy, I'll be gettin' that
Drugs or hoes, either way you know I'm hittin' that
I don't wear floral boy I just smoke it straight out the back
LA can see my whole existence, y'all be dissin' that
I'm puttin' niggas on, I swear to god I'm givin' back
And if you push me to the limit, you'll regret that
Compared to mine, some diamonds in your mouth look like some plaque
Final Fantasy, I'm savin' clouds like I am zack
Can't be no trendy nigga because that shit so wack
Chattanooga Tennessee where I spent my summers at
Lived in the city, lived in the suburbs
Burnin' purp, burnin' bands, burnin' rubber
Gettin' more green gettin' flubber
Gettin' more green gettin' flubber
All these unfamiliars round me always lookin' at
Is it cause the chick I'm with you probably thought you had?
Lookin' fabolous when I jug you just throw it in the bag

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
Ey yeah baby, go 'head and throw that in the bag that ain't shit

I can't bitch on the scene, boy, I'm in the trap
She can't wear no leggings around me, boy, I don't like that
Took his bitch with my wrist, he ain't like that
Loud pack, rollin' on my iPad
These Versace shades, I can't see that
All white bricks, all white bricks, my Chanel bag
I'm just life for life
I still took that flight
Fucked her the first night
Syrup sit on ice

First I go call up the troops

Then I go swool with the loot
Put that lil bih on her back
Told that lil bih to relax
Tell that lil bih I got back
Told that bih I got stacks
Hollup lil bih, that's lil cash
Spend a lil check on the rent
Spend a lil' check on the brick
She got the cake in the back
I got the K in the back
I got my face in the sack
Hit your block hard like some crack
I told that lil' nigga we back
I told that bih we got back
I told that lil' nigga we back
Who that boy there with the bag?
Who that bitch there with the ass?
I sip the lean and the gas

For that lil' work, bitch I tax
For that lil' verse, bitch I tax
All of these hoes, they attached
Fuckin' your bitch, that's some facts
Half of these niggas, they rats
Half of these niggas, they rats
Hit your block hard with the Gat
Hit your block hard like some crack

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Ayy, bitch I came up sellin' crack
Wasn't no sleep, I was up with the night owls
Some my niggas was there but ain't no more
Capo said he’ll vouch for it right now
Switchin' shifts from the alley to corner
See them cops at the block and yell right out
We don't put in, we out here with two jobs
You ain't trappin', you best have that pipe out
40 Glock with the stick and the light out
Roll the window down, stick this bitch right out
Nigga talkin' like he sick in this cold world
It's our shit up in here, take 'em right out
Internet got the world tryna fight now
All these tweets get a fuck nigga hype now
Disrespect me, I'll go to you right now
With these rhymes that I got, put you right down
And I will beat you up 'cause I know how
Lay a fuck nigga out if I like how
Livin' nights on that block, I couldn't lie down
Interrogations and I'll put that lie down
Still keep them choppers where we go
Still keep that fuego from migo
And I cannot fuck with no googoos
We treat the Rudys like Renos
Still rock cashmere with them [?]
Still rock Balmain with my new trues
G Herbo ain't no goody two shoes
Still'll do you 'cause I got some loose screws
Takin' trips outta town with my boo boo
Might skeet off right past you in the new coupe
She got weave in her hair and it's too loose
Got a Bs in the air, throw a soo-woo
Hit a lick like Ace Boogie with Lulu
Then I might buy her a poodle
And I might buy her a deuce deuce
Just in case she with me when I shoot you

[Outro: G Herbo]
Ayy, G Swervo
Yeah, deuce, deuce
Fuck up your life like some voodoo

Party, what we do

[Verse: Playboi Carti]
No ventilation, hoes stimulating on this novacane I'm making
Still searching for the one we in the Martrix
Words from the sea ?
Never gave a fuck about the ?
Muscle arms, muscle arms cooking up with baking soda
God never let my enemies get between insanity and Hova
Turning clouds into castles ? slow cameras roll
These bitches listen to us like we got mind control
Overdose my high nigga, I'm flying
By the jets shout out the sky nigga, I'm dying
I take a pound and break it down into a baby bud
Roll up a spliff, then I light it up, now take a puff
It takes concentration when I'm blazing on this elevation
Now treat your hate with my herbal medication
Yeah nigga, ?

[Outro: Sample from Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]
You smoking reefers?
Yeah of course we are, can't you smell it?
No Sam. I can't
Come on Dewey! Join the party!
No Dewey! You don't want this. Get outta here!
You know what I don't want no hangover, I can't get no hangover
It doesn't give you a hangover!
Well, I get addicted to it or something?
Its not habit forming
I don't wanna, overdose on it
You can't OD on it!
It's not gonna make me wanna have sex is it?
It makes sex even better
Sounds kinda expensive
Its the cheapest drug there is

Ugh switching it up
Chick on my dick and ain't giving it up
Say she just focused on getting me up
I got a different from agenda from her
My hair my flesh my blood,anointed with love
She want me to get in her guts
My roots run deep in the soil my melanin royal
No wonder she want me to fuck
Switching it up, no need to, no need to listen to ya
The way that I,way that I did it ga get me like diddy
No maybe like  Mansa Musa
Take this black panther from outta my drawers
To ya pum pum or puma whatever you call it
I got you scalding,you more than wet bae you boiling
I saw ya ex in the toilet,that's what my point is
You prefer niggas who pointless
Ya lifestyle I don't wanna spoil
,baby girl right now my life is to joyous
Shout my jewels in spanish call em hoyas
Hiding it hiding it right my forehead
Some of y'all shitty but still get pass
So shut up no need to be wack and annoying
Used to hate my life but now I enjoy it so aye

[Chorus]

Switch it up,yeah I switched it up
Give no fucks, cannot give no fucks
Something bout ya curves,baby get me stiff as fuck
You about to learn thats why these other niggas suck

[Verse 4]

Ooo you know how we do
Always tell the truth
That's why they hate me too
I got the natives stew
I feed my neighbors too
With that cat Carti in the cut just like a saber tooth
No tiger
Relationship, no title
I worship truth no idol
I see the light no eyes open
Demons reciting bibles
My money long like since Babylon been gone aye
My money long like the Tower of Babel
Looking straight at lingerie
Look like she wet her diaper
Super hyper pussycat about to kiss the viper
Shad fer up on the mic don't act like y'all don't like him
I evolved from a dog she turned me to a Lycan
Switched me up, yeah she switched me up



[Verse 1]

South girl gave me head while her nigga count his bread
And when i leave out this spot, don't let nobody in my crib
I got some shit up in that room
Some shit they don't assume
Some shit thats hard to consume
I don't mean digest by that
Got mid, got loud, got crack
Got pumps, AKs, and techs
These hoes haven't seen me flex
Drive around in an all white Lex
Nigga this ain't mine, this my ex
Yo new bitch, i guess
Yeah, she still tryna' have sex
Yeah, she still tryna have sex
