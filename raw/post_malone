[Intro]
Oooh, I fall apart
Oooh, yeah, mmhmm

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough, yeah
And she left me with a broken heart, yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault, yeah
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred, yeah
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain, yeah
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me, so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it
No, you said it
No, you said it
We'd be together

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought



[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, and choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

[Chorus]
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this
It just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this
It just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
Cold with the flex

'Cause I can't take it no more
No you ain't like them bitches
Tell them hoes adios

Leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor
I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'

The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus

And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning
You knew I was losing
You told me to wake up, oh, my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
And just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do with it
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
And just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

She said "love me" so I love her
She said "leave me" so I left
Then I went to California
And I ain't never comin' back

And I ain't sayin' that I love her
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
I done drank Codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And I won't go on, like a highway to hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
Where I go next, now, only time will tell

[Hook]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened now I'm makin' them hits so I'm fuckin' your bitch
No it ain't nothin' fickle for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist, skrrr
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker talk saucey
Pass me the drugs, motherfucker let me shine
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, beggin' that that be the code
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's been years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly but I ain't from Philly

Some shade every night, man, it's all so famil-y

Diamonds in my chain gold
Every 20 minutes, change clothes
I had a mil before the label
Just as long as they know, money made me do it
I said rest in peace to Bankroll
You in a better place, dog
You won't ever see me lay low
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas, melt your face off
Spend the day counting cake up
With a dime who think I changed up
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo
Ran through it like some Drain-o
Lot of bags, can't complain though
We was shopping until they closed
Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh, yeah
New whip, now I can pay my rent, ooh no, ooh yeah

Pocket full of street money
' Bout to count my blessing
One hundred, one thousand
100K, one million
We smoke, we lay up, we rap
We talked about a vision (switch it up)
I got diamonds like a rainbow, every time I change clothes
Shawty fucked my friend but I act like I ain't know
I'ma buy a rain coat, the storm might approach you
Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus
I do it on purpose, do it for the neighborhood
Smoking on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando

Can't hold my tongue, don't got the heart to
Remember when I fell in love?

I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah

[Verse 2: 1st]
If I got an issue, I don't need no tissue
My bitch started cryin', I bought her a shitzu
You gotta do what you gotta do just to get through
And if you play with my money, your mom gon' miss you
I started throwin' a tantrum, so I copped me a Phantom
And every time she gets mad, I throw the keys to the Jag
Broke niggas call me materialistic
We do not ball the same, you're still learnin' how to pivot
Since I got rich, I don't drink beer
Leave the mall, leave a trail of tears
I told my son don't have no fears
If he ever feels down we can take off in the leer
We could be gone tomorrow, love today
And when that check hit my account, this what I say

[Hook]
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah

[Intro - Sample]

[Verse 1]
Woke up in a hot tub, spillin' Moet, in the water
Then I light my Marijuana, take a shot up out the choppa
J's jumpin' out the locker, spend a little guapa
She want candy, Aaron Carter
I called her Candy when I saw her, pull up with my brothers
Candy-painted flyin' saucer, test me, you'll get flyin' colors

[Pre-Hook 1]

She said she don't wanna do too much drugs

And that's it, and that's it
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it

[Verse 2]
Wanna talk about them Martins?, Do you wanna talk about them Jordans?

Up until like 4, SmartWater like some dummies
Taking shots up out the semi, that shit kill me like I'm Kenny

[Pre-Hook 2]
Oh, bitches walking down the steps

[Hook]
Homie you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie you's a window shopper
At the dealership trying to get a test drive
Homie you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats my bezel heavy
Doors suicide they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you "youngin' you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell em their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated shit my rollie still cold
Aye-ye-ye
I got cha-ay-ay-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ay-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is ya'll sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain

[Hook]
Homie you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why

Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1: Repeated]

And they just wanna see me fail but dawg I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you "youngin' you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell em their shit never happenin'

[Part 1: Hollywood Dreams]

[Verse 1]
I'm in a four-door down rodeo
I'm getting fucked up, I'm losing control
I'm bumping Fleetwood, she tryna turn off my song
She keep asking where the party at
I got a flask full of vodka in my passenger seat
My homie got a mansion says that we could crash it for free
We gotta take the phones because we can't let nobody see
We pop a pill since you ain't have not a thing to eat

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they are playing
Say women, they will come and they will go

[Bridge]
When the rain washes you clean you will know
You will know
You will know
You will know
You will know

[Verse 2]
'Cause I got dreams, don't hold me down
So I'ma let you free, don't wanna hold you out
I'ma leave when the sun comes

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they're playing
Say women, they will come and they will go

[Part 2: Come Down]

[Chorus]
I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down
Just last night we was going so hard
But now I can't feel my heart
Let me down easy, don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep, getting up is gon' be tough
They was all actin sleazy, they all said I was the one
And with any damn luck, I'ma wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning

[Verse 2]
And let it pour, let it pour, let it pour let me roll
Man, I'm on a roll I'm so up in my zone
They thought that I was fuckin done with Iverson
But I'm still ballin' on these bitches, let them know
I just want everything, I want it all in advance
They just want me to call it quits
Homie just roll up a zip
Lil Posty don't fuck with y'all
Never been fuckin with y'all
We pull up they standing in awe
Yeah your bitch she know who we are

[Chorus]
I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down
Just last night we was going so hard
But now I can't feel my heart
Let me down easy, don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep, getting up is gonna be tough
They was all actin sleazy, they all said I was the one
And with any damn luck, I'ma wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning

I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "congratulations" (congratulations)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (uh)
Yeah, we made it (uh, yah)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
I was patient (yah, uh)
I was patient (ayy, uh)
Now I can scream that we made it (we made it!)
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say, "congratulations" (uh)
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (yah)
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby (ball)
I'm looking for someone to call, baby (brr)
But right now, I got a situation (ayy)
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins (cashes)
Big rings—ooh—, champagne (champagne)
My life is like a ball game (ball game)
But instead, I'm in the trap though (trap though)
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl (Super Bowl)
Super Bowl, call the hoes (brr)
Get in the Rolls (skrrr)
Top-floor lifestyle (top)
Huncho and Post—yah, ayy—Malone (ayy)
I gotta play on my phone (aye)
You know what I'm on (ayy)
Huncho Houdini is gone (ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone, Future & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all for my city, puttin' on (I dreamed)
They said I wouldn't be nothin'
Now they always say, "congratulations" (uh)
Worked so hard, I need my medication (uh-huh, ooh)
All it took was dedication (ayy)
Driving foreigns with no registration, oh we made it (ayy)

[Outro: Future]

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Bought a spaceship, bought a mansion, with J-Lo in the Hamptons
Diamonds dancin', I bought me a crib with a lake

And I'm really think I'm really king [?]
She make you wanna bow down

[Intro: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

[Verse 1: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that?"
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino + Jazzy Eff]
Our love love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Interlude: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

[Verse 2: Jazzy Eff + (Post Malone as Leon DeChino)]
Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad (Yes he does)
He remembers the times that y'all had
He's crying (I'm crying)
That's not okay

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino + Jazzy Eff]
Our love love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Bridge: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino + Jazzy Eff]
Our love love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Outro: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
So tell me, why, girl? Come on



[Hook]
Pulled a bitch out the hat, yeah that's... magic
And I got a lotta bitches at my... mansion
Molly, stogies, gas, and some... matches
Got your wifey on my lap like Outkast, tragic
Magic
Magic, alakazam
Magic
Magic, well I, alakazam

[Verse]
32 ounces on me like I'm Magic
Magic Johnson 3, I ain't playin' basketball
And we got some molly, magic potion, alcohol
I'm with Aphrodite, drinkin' nectar of the gods
Wakin' up to some Swishers and some liquor
Fuck 'em or fuck her, whatever get me faded quicker
She grind on my zipper cause I'm a big tipper
She stay in L.A. like she play for the Clippers
You see what we whippin', whole crew is shittin' on mothafuckas
Can't stand the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen
I got that Houdini, disappear her bikini
She rub on my lamp, damn I feel like a genie
On my magic carpet, I'm poppin' a wheelie
So fresh, you can't see me, I do this routinely
I don't do no freebies, you feel me?
I need me a couple bands
They appear in my fuckin' hands

[Hook]
Pulled a bitch out the hat, yeah that's... magic
And I got a lotta bitches at my... mansion
Molly, stogies, gas, and some... matches
Got your wifey on my lap like Outkast, tragic
Stony, magic
Magic, alakazam
Magic
Magic, well I, alakazam

I see shit in the L.A. sky
L.A. nights getting too damn high
Codeine in my blood, mud in my Sprite
Nicotine in the bud and the L.A. lights
Fuck all that shit about your human rights
I'mma make it real clear, shit black and white
I don't wanna see your face in my line of sight
Oh boy, try stuntin' on me? It don't happen
Couple Benji's stashed in that mattress
Told her back it up, she ass-backwards
Told her I'mma bring her back to my address
Told her she can have a sip of my Activ'
She gon' smoke on weed and then she gon' ash it
Told her girl, don't be gettin' distracted
Boy I pull up-up with your whore
That voodoo good so I roll that
Thirteen blunts, boy I smoke it
Thirteen life, boy I know it
Throw four in it when I'm feelin' Whitney
All this drinking is killing my kidneys
All this sip I'm sipin' gon' kill me
And motherfuckers walkin' if they ain't ridin' with me
Teeth shine in my mouth
Bad bitches all in my couch
You know it's foreign when I back out
Hit 'em with the woo-wap, she black out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Hoes fall asleep and all they ass' out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Woke up in the spot I'mma cash out

Give me the bag and i run it
Give me the bag and i run it
I want the cash in abundance
I want the cash in abundance
We the plush, that kush
All my niggas look like crooks
All my nigga hitting licks
You won't know how much we took
And thats the reason why
I know she gonna ride
I know she gonna ride
We run it
You and I
You been playing hard to get
Treat you like you don't exist
We just looking for the zen
We gonna get and then we did
We gonna get and then we did
We gonna get and then we did
Fly pass me the bag
Bitch you know its an assist

Chorus

I get that cash and i run it
I get that bag and i run it
I get that bag and i run it
I get that bag and i run it
Shawty she that she know she want it
Shawty she that she know she want it
I get that bag and i run it
I get that bag and I cut it
Told them to keep it one thousand
Only real niggas around me
All of these bitches be talking
All of my niggas they bow
All of my niggas we run it
All of my niggas we run it
Bitch I got what i wanted
Bitch I got what i wanted

Homie you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie you's a window shopper
At the dealership trying to get a test drive
Homie you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats my bezel heavy
Doors suicide they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you "youngin' you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell em their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game pose people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated shit my rollie still cold
Aye-ye-ye
I got cha-ay-ay-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ay-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is ya'll sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain

Homie you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin to get a test drive
Homie you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats my bezel heavy
Door's suicide they say a word they remember it
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you "youngin' you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell em their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche

[Verse: Aaryan Shah]
I'm all on my own, always live life on the road
She always be hittin' my phone
It's hard to get rid of her now
She knows that I'm never alone
I don't buy her shit anymore
She always be stealin' my clothes, yeah
Askin' me how does it feel
When you know you could buy out the store, yeah
I came a long way on my own, ayy
We doin' this shit on our own, ayy
These hoes always hit up my phone, yea
Cause I'm always puttin' them on and
I don't give a fuck what I'm told, ayy
I know I'm the next one to blow and
I hate when she calling' me over
Cause I end up falling' for her

[Hook: Kehlani + (Post Malone)]
I cross my t's and dot my i's yeah I'm for real (yeah, I'm for real)
He hold me down (she hold me down)
That's my shit (that's my shit)
He buy whatever, he know the drill (know the drill)
Don't need no pill (don't need no pill, no)
He whispered in my ear and told me feel, feel, feel, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Post Malone]
Fuck me 'til I can't see straight
Make me think that hoe was a mistake
I just need to feel you all the time
Ride hoe, ride hoe, alright, alright, alright



Ya no aguanto mas
No eres en la listas solamente otra mas
En el suelo La ropa
QUE ACABO DE QUITAR
No lo puedo negar
Se lo que va pasar

En otra prespectiva
Yo abajo tu arriba
Yo soy tu vida
Tu las derivaas
Eres bien venida
Niña  pervertida
Se que te gusta cuando al oido
Te dicen que eres  una diva
Tu mi querida
Bandida

Podemos hacerlo cuando tu quiera
Ropa en el suelo y tu yo juntos
En  la bañera
Tu y yo en el acura
Asiendo locuras
En la noche a oscuras
Sin ataduras
Mi dulce lindura !
Tu eres mi cura

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Eres imprudente
Aun asi necesito verte
Hay que vernos donde siempre
Es importante saber. si me entiendes

Dime si me entiendes
Esta noche la recordaras siempre
Todo empezo en el asiento de enfrente
Y ya no te saco de mi mente 
De mi mente

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Eres imprudente
Aun asi necesito verte
Hay que vernos donde siempre
Es importante saber. si me entiendes
Yaa

Dime si me entiendes
Esta noche la recordaras
Siempre
Todo empeso en el asiento de enfrente
Y ya no te saco de mi mente



[Intro]
Hahaha
Turn up
Turn up
(Yeah)
Hahaha

[Hook: Post Malone]
Sell my dues, bring the bottles to the crib
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib
We turnin' up, it's full throttle in this bitch
'Fuck is up with all these haters talkin' shit?
I just poured me up a cup
Call the plug and see what's up
Aye, I just poured me up a cup
Lemme show these haters up

Lookin' damn clean with the [?]
Screaming "Wu-tang Queen" [?]
[?] evil with the [?]
Pull up, ski-mask, balaclava
Damn, let me do the honors
Sign my name over by the commas
Hit the dash, spend a grand at Benihana's (got me faded on my [?])
Everything designer, Margiela got me lookin' like I'm walkin' on some water (oh shit)
Drop the top on the whip for the summer
Just finished this bottle, I'm 'bout to pop another
Tell the waitress "keep 'em comin'"
We always turnt up, ho, it's nothing
And tell my old bitch "don't worry who I'm fuckin'"
Keep the 'Rari engine running, hit the gas and I fuckin' blast past
Spillin' champagne out the damn glass, bitch I'm stuck (bitch I'm stuck)
And I'm livin' out in Cali now (bitch)
And bitch my life is lavish now (turn up)
Blowin' money and I'm laughin' now
RoDayo, drive a 4-2-4, I'm cashin' out

[Hook: Post Malone]
Sell my dues, bring the bottles to the crib
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib

Aye, I just poured me up a cup

Known to get a little from my side like a temp fade
I be in the A like a wrote a good essay
And add a little L to it when I do my West thing
She be takin' shots, no Goldie
In the spur of the moment like Chernobyl
Hit her with the Chris [?], pass to my homie
Keep it a 'hunnid, told me I done it
Told me to run it, drinkin' for nothing
Screamin' out "fuck it", we'll make her buss it
Turnin' up 'till it's over (aye)

Couple aces in my hand, I ain't bluffin'

And you know that my team just gon' keep actin' up
