[Intro: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on (ayy, ayy)
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on
Nigga get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother Skip, boy I had a good day
Metro PCS trappin', boy I'm makin' plays
Fifty shades of grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me
In the cut I'm rollin' up my broccoli
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
Said that I can get that pussy easily
Said that I can hit that shit so greasily
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily

[Bridge: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fuck shit
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fuck shit

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, "Okay you're special"
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the "why you got to stare" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me (Get off of me)
In the cut I'm rollin' up my broccoli (My weed, my weed)
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me (She fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
(My weed, my weed)
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
(She vulnerable)
Said that I can let that pussy easily
(She fallin' for)
Said I can hit that shit so greasily (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm a dirty dog I did it sleazily

[Verse 1: SZA]
I'll take care of you, I will
Even if I got a man now
I heard you a fan now
It's a little bit too late to take care of me
You could still
Even if I got a man now
'least you know where I stand now
'Cause I ain't been there, 'cause I ain't been there
I ain't been there
Tell me everything you think I wanna hear
I'll take care of you, I will
Even if I got a man now
Cause I been fucking fans now

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
Still let me take care of you
Even if you got a man now
Cause I been fucking fans now
In the back seat of my van now
Still I'll take care of you
Even if you got a man now
Fuck that nigga I never shake his hand now
That's why I'll be there
Ima be there, there, there (say it with me)
Cause I wasn't there
I swear, I'll be there just let me take care of you... of you



[Hook]
I ain't talkin' to you broke bitches I got money now
All a nigga understand is- since that check came in
Everybody's talkin' like a nigga actin' funny now
That don't matter, all I hear is- since that check came in
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
Since that check came in

[Verse 1]
Don't you know that I got that bag
And best believe my mama straight
I sent some bands to Tatiana
And if I brought you out I'll pay your way
I copped a second set of goldens, these ones way more colder
I'm in the sky like all the time and now it's no layover
My records all across the wave and there was no payola
This money new, these hundreds blue, I'm talkin' no Crayola
My credit card is a plastic bankroll
Still keep that knot cause I get guap from paid shows
Got a palace in the cut layin' low
Talkin' to that—
It does whatever I say so

[Hook]
I ain't talkin' to you broke bitches I got money now
All a nigga understand is- since that check came in
Everybody's talkin' like a nigga actin' funny now
That don't matter, all I hear is- since that check came in
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
Since that check came in

[Verse 2]
I used to get the coldest shoulders
But now I get the hottest ass
How I feel bout you is lukewarm
It burns you up cause I got all this cash
I'm askin', "Where you work at
What kind of car you drive"
Beat down Accord, cashier up at Five Guys
I get thousands for the walk through inside
Night clubs, strip clubs, big bucks, yes sir that's right
You done got left if you don't got my new number
A rich man told me it's a part of the come up
Remember when they used to want me to shut up
Now it's ironic cause I only conversate with those hundreds

[Hook]
I ain't talkin' to you broke bitches I got money now
All a nigga understand is- since that check came in
Everybody's talkin' like a nigga actin' funny now
They don't matter, all I hear is- since that check came in
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
Since that check came in

If I'm up in my feelings, better pay the man

Like I'm the shits with the shits
Fuck another nigga bitch again off the shits again
Island boy like I'm Dominican
On repeat like a ceiling fan
All pink like I'm Killa Cam
Palms, feet and let 'em feel the sand
On the beach like I'm finna tan
Black and proud like the brother man
Make it rain like the weatherman
Bust your head, fuck a settlement
Got to save and never sell again

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' like I'm finna make a million
Twenty thousand at the pavilion and they screamin' for me can you feel it
I just left from Gabriels makin' music
On my way to Katiegos we be coolin'
Like leftover plates to go
Then we heat up fellatio, x and o's
One hour euphoria three hours of arguments
The next four I'm unsure bout my place in this world what the fuck in my life I did

[Hook]
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money

[Verse 2]
What the fuck was I put here for
What the fuck is my purpose brain lurkin'
My momma mad I ain't working
I feel worthless but when I'm on stage and workin I am perfect
I mess up in perfect stride its alright just as long as you feel the vibe feel the vibe
I don't know how you feel inside
But to me when you run and hide thats music suicide
I done felt crucified not gone lie but I resurrected in time
I’m not Christ but I fear him like mama and grandma
Get drunk like my uncles It's Miller time number nine
I roll up to ease my mind it’s my sedative
Get me through sleepless nights got them headys lit
Headed to riches and notoriety still music my medicine plus the adrenaline

[Hook]
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money

[Verse 3]
Been came through paid dues
Just imagine ten steps in my shoes
Riding round Hampton and The News
Broke nigga lookn hard for a clue
I ain't got dope I got dope tho dope flow
Sitn on this talent is a no no leaned back
Sipping on active feeln slow mo speed lag
Give me more time I can flow more believe that
No no no I don’t care what you think because I believe in me
Ima own my goals write it down on a sheet watch it all come to me nigga
Restless days sleepless nights with my computer head phones and mic
Its gone pay off when the time is right and guess what it feels like the time is right
I feel like dynamite

[Hook]
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money
This be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money

[Intro: D.R.A.M.]
Hey
Looking, oh-whoa, hey

[Verse 1: D.R.A.M.]
I know you working hard
But how you gon' figure me out? Hey
Huh, always running your mouth
Never knowing what you talking about, hey
Look, what's there to figure?
When you speak of that nigga that you can't understand
Hey, and now I'm all on the road, huh
Running 100 miles an hour, not even which way to go, huh
Look, if I don't know myself
Then tell me how do you know? Huh
I've come to prove and show you niggas
That I'm trained to go, look, uh, hey, uh, uh
But what's there to figure?
When you speak of that nigga, you don't understand

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
But fuck it, I flood this ho with these bands
Do a drive-by, fly-by, leave him where he staying
I just bought an AP, it's cleaner than stainless
I wish I could tell him but he duckin' dangerous
He ready for popping off and all he ain't scared of us
He say he ain't no snitch but he tired of tellin' us
I flood that bitch with Gucci she stand from the ceiling up
Fuck the cops, they killing us, they kids are not real as us
But what's there to kill about?
When these bitches and niggas, they won't just understand
Dat-dat I can fuck any bitch in here without paying
Hey, where my phone at? Call lil Tar, I need some Xannies
I want these poor niggas to complain
I want these fake robbers to keep laying
And he ain't want these fake bitches to keep singing
Think they baby is mine like they gon' get a dime
We'll work it out with time
I want yours cause you got mine
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, it ain't nothing to talk about
So I'm like what's there to kill about?
When these bitches and niggas, they won't just understand

[Verse 3: D.R.A.M.]
As I revisit what I made for you to listen to
I get into my zone and let go, that's the ritual
Ask but when I mention you, not having clues and being fooled
Darling to this one trick pony, thought "I'm not the dude"
And you can be a local heathen to the son of Satan
I give it up to him who praises and that's all I'm saying
I made a killing for a better life
Remember once and I'll forget it twice
Took advantage over night
I pray to God and hope I'm moving right
I pray on y'all to quench my appetite
Told you that my screws ain't tight
I had to buckle down and focus cause I almost lost it
I was hemorrhaging in the red and I could not afford it
Niggas tried to appropriate me, I could not go for it
I'm talking mine, I'm claiming mine, bitch I go Narcos for it
They gon' make me glow up, I got no choice I'm saying
But what's the point of saying if you still won't understand?



[Verse 1]
A simple hey from you
Holds more rank than a love letter from any super star
Or if I ran across how I think
I think I might get dirt on my white jeans for ya
In this park with this shiny wedding ring for ya
Yeah, feelings that I had for you are too real for me to explain
You be finishing my sentences like you lodged up in my brain
I cried, I sweated for ya, and I bleed for ya
And your love is the only thing I need from ya
Hey

[Hook]
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
When we get together girl, that is when we most complete

[Bridge]
100% not ninety-nine but you keep it 100
100%, that's because you give me your love, your loving
100, 100, 100

[Verse 2]
And I can recall every single mistake
Like whenever I make haste to entertain hoes in my face
But baby let me put your worried mind at ease for ya
You got way more to provide for me than these whores
I ain't had nothing but a dollar and a dream and you
So many things, got in the way when all my dreams came true
So many times I used to want to let you dream for me
But instead I'd rather crown you as a queen for me

[Hook]
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
Half of me is all of you, half of you is all of me
When we get together girl, that is when we most complete

[Bridge]
100%, not ninety nine but you keep it 100
100%, that's because you give me your love, your loving
100, 100, 100

Oh first time we came in together
Guess we the ones

[Verse 1]
Feeling cooler than the April breeze
As we blow like the summer leaves
Girl I'm just hanging around
And I'll come back down
When you choose to come visit me now
The crazy thing about my treehouse
It's always me bugging me out
It's all of the beautiful sounds
That keeps my mouth quiet
Cause me I'm being so
Loud

[Chorus]
One glad morning
I'll be waiting
With my lighter, to blaze (blaze)
Till that evening
You come over
And let me take you away
Yeah

[Interlude]
I (?) the four pops
Singing songs to the trees
So I'm up in the city
Smoke that sweet Virginia breeze

[Verse 2]
Girl it's looking so nice out
Thinking maybe we can step out
And give all the city a stroll
And we can talk about the places where we want to go
Cause baby I got big dreams
Hollywood and the movie screens
Billions of fans all for me
With cars passing by and me hearing them play my CD

[Chorus]
One glad (one glad) morning (morning)
You'll be (you'll be) waiting (waiting)
With your (with your) lighter (lighter) to blaze (to light up)
Till that (till that) evening (evening)
I'll come (I'll come) over (over)
And let you take me away
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Fuck girl let's get so high that it casts on to the moon
(to the moon babe)
When we get back to daylight we can just keep our mood
All I wish is you'll still be here when I get off tour
When I get back we'll get higher than ever before

[Bridge]
Real love, feel love, taste love, smoke love
Real love (real love)
Feel love (feel love)
Taste love (taste love)
Smoke love (smoke love)
Real love, feel love, taste love, smoke love
Real love (real love)
Feel love (feel love)
Taste love (taste love)
Smoke love (smoke love)
Taste love, taste love, smoke love, smoke love

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh



[Part I: Outta Sight]

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
If I don't call you that means I ain't tryna be on your shit
Even though I'm on your shit
If I ignore you
Don't take it as me being rude
It's just that I had things to do
I know what it feels like to be in love again
I know so (?) go for it
If I don't text back, shit
It just means that I had something to say
And I ain't want you reading it anyway
Girl you need to relax
You know I fuck with you the long way
So you don't have to call everyday

[Pre-Hook]
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Check up on a nigga
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Emphasis on little

[Hook]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind

[Verse 2]
If you don't call me, shit
I'ma turn to petty drama
Cause I'ma think that you moved on
And if you stalk me
It's all good but that's a fact
I'm never gonna call you back

[Pre-Hook]
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Check up on a nigga
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Emphasis on little

[Hook]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind

[Outro]
I'll be thinkin' 'bout you from time to time
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Even that lil bit of pudge you got on your tummy
I'll play with it just like a stack of money

[Part II: Dark Lavender Interlude]

[Intro]
This for everybody
It's got a little bit of sauce in it though
You know?
Oh sexy, so sexy
What makes you mad might make me happy
When I'm with her, sad

[Skit]
DRAM: Oo, hello?

Girl: Hey umm, where am I going? Am I going to the studio?

DRAM: Yeah we're still over here

Girl: Okay cause we're in traffic right now so we're like I don't
Know like 35 minutes away

DRAM: Okay that's cool we'll still be here

Girl: Okay then I'll see you bye (bye)

[Verse]
Oo it's the truth
I've been playing around skipping around with
Real life, cyber life, and his life
Oh-ohh
It's not quite blue
But it has a similar hue
Dark lavender

[Outro]
Man this Heineken light taste real good
And it's not even ice cold, we gotta fill the ice box
We're gonna be closer, we're gonna be closer



[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, oh, hey, oh
I do remember

[Verse 1]
Uh, I do remember, girl I do remember
How you said I was your temper, made me feel like a contender
You acknowledge other niggas who you knew was out to get you (that ain't right)
Fuckin' with the camera man and you still ain't get the picture (snapshot)
I can toss a thousand words to you quick band
But I'ma say nothin' 'cause I need you as my kickstand
Tired of all these hoes that be claimin' that they big fans
Soon as I'm in town they blow my line to buy the wristband
All access and bad sex but hair fire
Just to do the same to the headliner
Even at my own shows curse by (they do)
Make me miss my old thing, it's still quiet
But we can up the volume for the evening
And I only mean evening, by sunrise you're leavin'
You still ain't my girl, we damn sure ain't friends
So we can cut that whole "How you been?" and "Where you been?"
'Cause that's the end

[Chorus]
Girl you know where the fuck I'm at
Bute street, off of Monticello Ave
And girl you know where the fuck I've been
On the road, tryna enlarge my dividends

[Verse 2]
I toss and turn, backwoods got burned
Many nights, contemplate about you
And all the compalinin' I do
About these hoes and how I know they ain't true
I'm still mad at you for the shit you did
But not that mad, so just come to where I'm is
I've text you once but did not send
Erase what's typed, type back again
Indecisive about the very next move
Fool me once, I don't want number two
And I'm still mad at you for not handling biz
But you can still get the biz
So just come to where I'm is
Please 'cause I really just can't take this shit no more
Oh, it seems that I can't win from losin'
All these triflin' hoes hate, I don't know which to be choosin'
Sometimes I turn to you
In the lowest times, when I'm sad and blue
'Cause you know that we got history
So just come to where I'm finna be

[Chorus]
Girl you know where the fuck I'm at
Bute street, off of Monticello Ave
And girl you know where the fuck I've been
I'm tryna enlarge my dividends
Girl you know where the fuck I'm at
Off of Monticello Ave
And girl you know where the fuck I've been
On the road, I'm tryna enlarge my dividends

[Outro]
Soon as, you get on the avenue
Move that pretty little ass over
To my room in the back
No words, lay back, relax
Quiet, don't you apologize
Quiet, hush up with all them lies
You in? One night of rough sex
But after I still won't answer your text
Soon as, you get on the avenue
Move that pretty little ass over
To my room in the back
No words, lay back, relax
Quiet, don't you dare apologize
Quiet, hush up with all them lies
You in? One night of rough sex
But after I still won't answer your text
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm on Monticello
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Avenue
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh



[Intro: DRAM]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: DRAM]
Know that shit just happened but by her reaction
You would think I been the man, you make it look easy
Even though it's cliche, I saw you on your Instagram and

[Chorus: DRAM]
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Oh, you think I'm cute, but I think you ugly
Trust me, it's cool, I use you for money
Flowers for me, don't do nothing for me
Fly to Dubai, in a yacht, you could blow me
Dinner at Philippe, but I really want a Philippe
Gonna have to step your game up
I'm the hottest bitch in the streets
I'm the hottest bitch in the game
Know I'm the wettest bitch in the sheets
All them little bitches you fuck
Yeah, they're cute, but they are not me
Me, me, me, me, I'm a beast
Me, I'm a dog, I don't come on no leash
This bitch is ballin', just look at my piece
Whippin' the foreign, I'm bending these streets
Woo! Woo! Look at my piece
This bitch is ballin', just look at my piece
Whippin' the foreigns, I'm bending these streets
Send out a hit and they tell me, "Capiche"

[Chorus: DRAM]
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute

[Verse 3: DRAM]
I just had to park my car 'cause I was finna crash the whip
Scrolling through my feed I saw you just had post a pic
I choose you like a Pokémon
I choose you, you're selection one
I got money, you got money too
So let's go half on rent
When I buy you a new purse it's 'cause you bought my kicks
I move fast like a brand new car
I move fast like a shooting star
If I say we married then goddamn we gettin' married
If you need it and I got it you can have it, bitch, I'm sharing
If you cryin' I'ma ask you why you crying, bitch I'm caring
If you need me to look out for you I'm posted and I'm staring
Thou should never have another boyfriend, I get jealous
Yeah, I’m all 'bout spreadin' love, but I get crazy as a felon
I choose you, now you have to deal
But you're so cute, you can make me chill

[Chorus: DRAM]
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute
I think you're cute, I think you're cute
Oh, yes I do, I think you're cute

[Outro: DRAM]
Girl, we need to go out on a date
We can really do a little something
If it's cool, I'll pick you up at 8
We can really do a little something
We can really do a little something, lil' baby
Looking at this pretty face, it drives me crazy



[Intro]
It's all happening, it's coming back and getting it
It's my time now

[Chorus]
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself
'Cause I got tired of waitin' on everyone else
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself
(Big Baby)

[Verse]
'Cause ain't nobody gonna do it better than you, you
'Cause ain't nobody gonna do it better for you
'Cause ain't nobody gonna do it better than you, for you
No one can do you better than you

[Chorus]
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself
(I had to tell myself to go and get it myself)
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself
(I had to tell myself to go and get it myself)
I got tired of waitin' on everyone else
(Just make sure you do)
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself
I had to tell myself to go and get it myself



[Intro]
Uhh, hey hey

[Part I: In a Minute]

[Hook]
We ain't X and O in a minute
I think I want you to come over, tonight
You say that you are celibate
Well, lets celebrate the first time you
Get this pipe
In a minute, I'll be there
In a minute, she'll grab your hair
In a minute, I'll give your ass a lil slap
In a minute cause I know you like it like that
We ain't X and O in a minute
I think I want you to come over tonight (come over)
And you said you so celibate
Well lets celebrate the first time you
Got this pipe
In a minute, I'll be there
I'ma hit you, I'll grab your hair
My Dicks official, (yeah you know it)
Thats what you said (you know it)
And once I'm in it, girl don't be scared (girl don't be scared)

[Verse 1]
Give me a minute, I'll work your ass out for a hour
Put that shit on for the tower
She dirty get sparked like a owl
Tremendous amounts of the power
Suck it up turn on the vacuum (damn)
She sneeze on the dick I'm like achoo
I'm so happy that I holla'd at you
No matter fact, bitch you infected me
That was four months ago, but I had to leave
Gotta travel the land and the seven seas
You was wearing your pussy all on your sleeves
You was letting these fuck niggas come and beat
Then you had the epiphany, suddenly
You couldn't go without vitamin D (hell nah)
Before you went back to me
But thats how you end up malnourished
Come get your nutrition
You don't know what the fuck you been missing
I learned like 8 new positions
I tried to get with me
You already know how it go when we already kissing
Already admit that you miss me
So keep it one hundred and fifty

[Hook]
We ain't X and O in a minute
I think I want you to come over tonight (Come over)
And you say you so celibate
Well, lets celebrate the first time youu
Got this pipe
In a minute, I'll be there
I'ma hit you, grab your hair
My Dicks official (yeah you know it)
Thats what you said (you know it)
And once I'm in it, girl don't be scared

In a minute....

[Part II: In House]

1, 2, 3, 4...

[Bridge]
Yeahhhh
In house, hey hey, hey hey in house, yeah yeah yeah
In house, hey hey, hey hey, in house, we got that
Weed, got that in the house
Lean,  got that in the house
Bitches, got that in the house
I wish I was back in my house
In house, in house

[Verse]
I'm always on the road
I got somewhere to go
But I know you know, I want to be home
I got somewhere to go, 'cause I'm always on the road
But I know you know
I wanna be home, to you, I wanna be home, to your kisses darlin'
I wanna be home, to the tender lovin' darling baby
I wanna be home for the simple things you do
Make the sweetest love to you, when I'm back
In house, in house, in house, oh, in house

[Bridge]
Weed, got that in the house
Lean,  got that in the house
Bitches, got that in the house
I wish I was back in my house
In house, in, in house

[Hook]

But I know you know, I want to be home (yeah)
I'm always on the road, (always on the road)
I got somewhere to go (got somewhere to go)
Why you trippin' bro, gahdamn



[Intro]
This song is a confession with all my second guessin'
At all of my discretion (And all that, and all that)
And all our conversations, and all that time we waited
Before we finally made it (And all that, and all that)
And your cellular phone suspicion and all your fingers hit it
You askin' me 'bout bitches (And all that, and all that)
And all the lacerations and all the aggravation
Girl, listen to what I'm sayin' (And all that...)

[Chorus]
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe
It's worth it if I got you

[Verse 2]
Fingers crossed, hopin' that she don't scroll too far
Down to see, my little plea for Emily
To lay with me while she was so far away
Why did I leave my phone out? That's a rookie mistake
She love crackin' codes like a kid loves cake
Infiltration in fifteen minutes, I wish my password wasn't my name
That's real nigga shit, now I gotta deal with this bitch
Mouth and her hand submissions
Gotta watch 'cause her stance South Pole position
Plenty swings all missin' 'cause she rather be kissin'
Crazy 'cause it took two months to get it
Probably went through way too much to hit it
But I got it and I'm tryna keep it
Cause we celebrate every weekend
And she polish it every evenin'
Love is a hell'uva drug
But it still rule out my addiction to lust
Every time I leave out she lose a little of trust
Every step that I take it increase the stars
'Cause girl I'll be back when I'm back not givin' a fuck
But I'll be devastated if it's splitin' us up
It's a double-edge sword, a two-sided war
But instead of making peace I still reach for the door, damn
Damn, damn

[Chorus]
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe
It's worth it if I got you



[Intro]
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my baby
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my boo
Said it ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my lady
And in about twenty-somethin' minutes, she'll be coming through

[Hook]
Baby let me get you that Uber
Just so you can come over and chill
I will
And baby when I get you that Uber
Ima watch it as it drive and maneuver, for real
I will

[Verse 1]
When I hit your line, you seemed surprised
Cause usually when you call I don't reply (I decline)
But I got time today, okay, you crossed my mind
Cause you seem real and plus you chill, that's hard to find
You can find out all the ways I want to do you
Soon as you send the addy, I'ma call this Uber (to you, to you)
Black truck, nothing less, just select
You're the one I select 'cause you're so real you ride the X

[Hook]
Baby let me get you that Uber
Just so you can come over and chill
I will
And baby when I get you that Uber
Ima watch it as it drive and maneuver, for real
I will

[Verse 2]
Me and you, long overdue
How many months? It's been a few
But will we fuck? That's up to you
When you come through, just make a move
Just say the word, when you tryna skrrt
Or I'll call it early if you just tryna flirt
Don't waste my time, cause I rarely have it
I'll call you that Uber, have you in rush hour traffic
Damn!

[Hook]
Baby let me get you that Uber
Just so you can come over and chill
I will
And baby when I get you that Uber
Ima watch it as it drive and maneuver, for real
I will

[Outro]
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my baby
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my boo
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my lady
And in about twenty-somethin' minutes, she'll be coming through



[Intro]
Haha-ha
Would you do, would it do?
Hey, hey
Make no, make a sunny mood, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking back in my life
You won't shift me, damn, damn
If I called your ass why

Bitch you remember me

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
All 10 digits

Shit, I'm bout to change my number on you

[Verse 1]
I told her lil, need a lil volume
I'm tryna get turned up, shit
She said all we need is a lighter
Tryna get burnt up, bitch please
You know I remember you
Pressed on you since middle school
Even when we got grown
Your shoulder remained cold
You must take me as a fool
Wanna use a nigga like a tool
I say no
Where I'm going you cannot go

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
All 10 digits
You get with it
Shit, I'm bout to change my number on you
You weren't fucking with me
You know, L

[Verse 2]
Woke up this morning feeling good cause I am myself
Look in the mirror like damn, you got a lot of inner wealth
Dropped the motherfucking project
Everybody feeling your shit
"Cha Cha" is apparent
But you got several hits

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
All 10 digits
You get with it
Shit, I'm bout to change my number on you
You weren't fucking with me
You know, L

[Verse 3]
You gon' let me see you in the underwear
Cause you think I'm bout to take you everywhere
Baby you wasn't there when the rest of them cared
Now it's sold out events, twelve dollars is your fare
Chilling in a motherfucking Uber-Uber
Looking for a motherfucking shooter, psh-psh
Not with a gun, with a video cam
Just to show how I move round the city, I'm the man
You don't understand, you don't get, nah nigga
Niggas throwing up and niggas pitching down
It's a slight difference
I got years under my britches
And yeah I'm 28 nigga, I'm 28
I got bitches younger than me that think that they old
And you can suck a dick, I put it in your face
Cause one epic summer greatest story told
Greatest story told cause this shit was true
Nigga I got proof that it weren't a fluke
Bitch I dripping juice since middle school
I was called big dog since little dude
On the microphone I'm big dog
They knew that since a lil boy
I would treat it like a motherfucking full time job bitch
They'll treat it like a lil toy

[Outro]
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
You weren't fucking with me, no



[Hook]
Throw it around, Throw it around, Throw it around (so loosely)
Throw it around, Throw it around, Throw it around (so loosely)

[Verse 1]
So you've been throwing signals, sometimes the color green
And when I touch your shoulder, you know just what I mean
And when you come on over, you let me in between
And if you hit good, I let you on the team
So you've been throwing signals, sometimes the color yellow
You've been acting fu-funny as fuck, when I say hello
And when I get you drunk, all up in the club
You say that you trynna come over but you ain't trynna fuck (what the fuck is up?)
You've been throwing signals, sometimes the color red
You ain't fucking with the boy, I don't know what I said
But is all good, I'mma treat you with despise
And instead of being with you, I'mma be with your home girl and the white and her pussy tight

[Hook]
Throw it around, Throw it around (so loosely)
Throw it around, Throw it around, Throw it around (so loosely)

[Verse 2]
So you've been throwing signals, yeah, you've been throwing vibes, the lows and the highs
And no, I'm not surprised
You've been throwing signals, yeah, you say you down to ride
But when niggas pull up, you will not hop inside

[Bridge]
I know you understand what's going down
I want a piece of that ass that you be throwing around

[Hook][2x]
Throw it around, Throw it around (so loosely)
Throw it around, Throw it around, Throw it around (so loosely)

[Verse 1: D.R.A.M.]
Forgive me father cuz I told my momma
The only drug I do is marijuana
But that's a lie
I get high like all the time
I'm a double cup specialist
A big fan of Actavis
Ever since my dog had let me sip
Molly took my brain and she left it somewhere
When I find her i'ma grab her by her pretty blonde hair
Rollin in Richmond like wheels on a chair
Wit my cousins and bros it's a family affair
Don't you be stingy nigga
Puff puff and pass the shit
You lucky my mind is gone
Cuz if not I would count your hits
Lord keep me way from these chiefin' ass niggas
I'm losing my mind cuz my bag getting thinner
Fuck eating whoppers i need me a yopper
Wit cheese i had me a double stack for dinner
Orange juice, water too
I don't know what i'm going through
But as soon as find my mind
I'ma do what i'm supposed to do

[Hook]
I must be losing my mind
I get fucked up all the time
I just been losing my mind
Yup I been losing my mind

Wanna see if this girl really do squirt

I swear you might grind i swear you might twerk
Do somethn strange for heezy man and its easy man
Lean on me lean on me

Getn fucked up ain't no mystery
Whole 8th in the blunt ain't shit to me

Rollin up blunts all the time

Lean on me lean on me
Got the sprite now the rest is history
Getn fucked up ain't no mystery
Whole 8th in the blunt ain't shit to me
Mind gone mumbling x4



[Verse 1]
Question do you look to me for your protection?
Am I your weapon of destruction?
The answer do I need it? No I don’t
But still I have a question
Why you tell me I’m so inspirational?
Then you find it so easy to tell me no
I guess that’s how it goes

[Hook]
So give me a reason to send flowers directly to where you work
Make you feel like this what you deserve cus I put on
So give me a reason to put kisses directly between your lips
Put this good thing all in between your hips put you on

[Verse 2]
You went out for drinks tonight so you call me hoping that I come over 'til you sober
I like it when you drink at night cus we make love
I kiss you til the morning light
Six something in the a.m. while you layin onside of me
But then you say you need some time that’s enough I think Im done “no I'm not”

[Hook]
So give me a reason to send flowers directly to where you work
Make you feel like this what you deserve cus I put on
So give me a reason to put kisses directly between your lips
Put this good thing all in between your hips put you on

Niggas tight on bread it's like I'm hugging loaves
And all a nigga want to do is fucking smoke
I know I'm worth at least a million cnotes
Fire tracks I keep those plus I know people
2$ means I need some new dollars
I used to want a gig but then my dreams followed
Go hard or go home that's the theme and motto
And go get it cuz it's yours and bitch believe the motto
I know I'll only get it if I come to you
So lemme get 2$ on pump 2

Talkin bout old money I knew dollars
I blew hunned's before color change
That's blue dollars
Forget two dollars, ima need mo' dollars mo buck mo digits, need two commas
Two dollar & two dollar that's four dollars I ate dollars
Who said slim ain't got weight problems
It's all facts if ima rapping it
Keep it cool, never spit how family was wrapping it
I don't feel you, you know that one thing, you lackin it
Since when all y'all so called was trappin
Why y'all think I snap when y'all rappin
I move round with the book ah I'm stackin
If I'm backpack well I got
Verses of crack in it crack and sniff
Get a whiff of the realness we killed this

I've been running out of options to make it work
You played me first, I get you back, and when I do, it's gon' hurt
I've been doing more than clocking in to make it work
When I had no job, damn, I still went hard, on my god put you first

[Verse]
Bottom of the ninth and the bases are loaded
Baby that was your moment, but you just did not know it
Whose fault but your own, sympathy I can't show it
Girl I thought you was grown, but now you kiddie, I'm hopeless, I hope that you know that you hurt me and you fucked up my focus
Was kinda hard to control it but still you called me controlling
And if I really had power over your body and mine
You would have been at the door when I was checking the time

[Hook]
I've been running out of options to make it work
You played me first, I get you back, and when I do, it's gon' hurt
I've been doing more than clocking in to put in work
When I had no job, on my god I did my own to put you first

[Bridge]
If you are running out of options, let me hear say damn (damn)

Except I'm kinda shocked that your approach was kinda thirsty
Cause you look so goddamn good like you's a stripper

You've been blowing up my phone like it's something really urgent
But I'm 3 days away in L.A., girl why you nervous?
Cause I be really contemplating on making new life with you

[Chorus]
Big baby D.R.A.M. I'm from Hampton baby
And I'm never around there
So I might sound crazy when you hit me up
All about my cakes and not coming through is nothing new
Oh this is something to do nah ok then
Big baby D.R.A.M. I'm from Hampton baby
And I made my way out I might sound crazy
How In Malibu I had a studio session
With this bearded dude named Ricky Rube
I bet you met him too ok then

[Verse 1]
They threw my mattress out
Where do they stay
They fluffed their pillow up
And begin to lay
Then they would close their eyes
And pull over the sheets and on the subject to me
And slowly went to sleep
Big baby D.R.A.M. I'm from Hampton baby
And my family still there some looking at me crazy
Because some of them they ask me how my day job
Is coming along and they say songs won't work it off
Ok then they know They really know
They couldn't figure Now they treat me different
The same Hampton nigga Big baby drama from Hampton baby
Where the chip on my shoulder that’s been trying to outweigh me
It's a heavy shit trying to keep a level head with steadiness
Giving you no reason for forgetting this ok then we
Change hand this ain't for the better
Women weeding weather I want to cut a joint with Kendric
But it must be special I step into places all dredded like
He must be ghetto these racist faces looking
Looking at me don't mind I’m fucking settled
If you don't come back on the temples of my shoulders
Any minute niggers might tip over and then it’s over
I go over shit and spending time with all my niggers
And my team some are bogus some just want
Some are colour blind it's only green
I use to see red like it was blood in my eyes
Bad bitches blow the dust out my eye
And then some rubbing their thighs
Think of yours that was off limit or not
Or you turned on because your boy winning
Tough loss coast to coast with it like curve ball
Give me four weeks then I'm splurging ball
High school reunion and I'm foreign thats ball
Small fraction of the cash I got from touring
Very important all in I can't forget where I’m from
I'm a Hampton nigga I'm a Hampton nigga
I said all in all I can’t forget where I’m from
I'm a Hampton nigga  I'm a Hampton nigga
I'm a Hampton nigga  I'm a Hampton nigga
I'm gone



[Verse 1]
When you gotta go you gotta go
More ways than one
When you gotta go you gotta go
Don’t make me seem like I'm dumb

[Hook]
When you gotta go you gotta go
When you gotta go you gotta go
When you gotta go you gotta go
When you gotta go you gotta go

[Verse 2]
You know that feeling sometimes you gotta leave from your situation
Before you self-destruct and implode on this nation
For real I wanted it to work but sometimes you can't have what you want
Still waiting on you to get the notion
Its better off in motion because
When you gotta go you gotta go
More ways than one
When you gotta go you gotta go
Not sayin this just for fun

[Hook]
When you gotta go you gotta go
When you gotta go you gotta go
When you gotta go you gotta go
When you gotta go you gotta go

[Outro]
Swear I need to leave away from here
Somewhere long as fuck away from here
Got get myself up outa here
I gota go I gota go



[Verse 1]
So i had like one song
At this party in New york or maybe it was in LA
You know that she had done some
No pencil but it was written all over her face
Where she really come from
I don’t really care I just know that she not for here
Lookin' mollied up like a college girl
Upside down tubes chuggin' some beer
Where you buy your drugs at
I know you got some percocet, you sound like you on xanax
You can’t even walk straight
Your knees buckling I’m surprised you ain’t fall yet
You tell me why your ass fat
And why you so cool in letting me grab that
And why you telling me you want me to have that
Everything about you utmost is abstract

[Chorus]
She’s with the shit
She’s with the shit
She’s with the shit
So much shit she on so much shit she on yea
She’s with the shit
So much shit she on so much shit she on yea
She’s with the shit

[Verse 2]
I can see it in your eyes because your pupil's swollen
And i don’t got to have a watch to know that you have a moment
I need a moment too I’m on as much as you
That was round about two there was nothing much to do
I could barely understand you cause you slurring bad
Use to swiping back for that glass shout out to your dad
I got to have that flat I know you into that
And I got a bachelor pad I know you into that
I know you into sex girl we should intersect
After this send the text or even call collect
You might say I’m the best but it’s all finesse
And plus I got some tricks you haven't seen yet
We are both grown and we are both strong
She so with her shit
She insists I take her home so I took her home

[Chorus]
She’s with the shit
She’s with the shit
So much shit she on so much shit she on yea
She’s with the shit
So much shit she on so much shit she on yea
She’s with the shit
So much shit she on so much shit she on yea
She’s with the shit
She’s with the shit
She’s with the shit



[Verse 1]
First I wanna get this money
Then I wanna an Audi A8
Then I want a crib or somethin'
A brownstone in BK
Then I want a pad in LA
I want it man
And then I want a new crib
I wanna party like the red pill
But still take the blue pill
And then I wanna give back
Get a mansion on the hill for my mama
She deserve that
Then I want an album so cold
That it frostbit the mic and speakers it was mixed on
And then I want a sold out tour
With my best performance in Singapore and they all sing along, aye
And then I want more, more, more
More butts, cars, drugs, stuff, more, more, more
All of these things that I think that I need
To succeed to exceed my beliefs that I want it all, ...yeah
Said I want it all,... yeah, yeah, yeah
I just want it all
I just want it all, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well first I want your phone number
And then I wanna take you on a date
But first what's your name?
And then I wanna ride with you
I'd rather hit the highway
To smoke this L take the interstate
And then I wanna conversate
Playfully argue bout who had the best entree
I won with the fish filet
I complement your t-bone steak
My fingers then caress your waist
And then I touch you on the way home
From your bosom to the tunnel of your soul
Girl, you're soaked
Then I wanna stop you 'fore you go
Drag you in my elevator fuck you harder on the floor
Then I wanna grab you by your throat
While I hit it from the back
While you begging me for more

[Outro]
I love these days that I think that I need
To succeed to exceed my beliefs that I want it all, ...yeah
Said I want it all, ...yeah, yeah, yeah
Please believe me when I say I want it all
I just want it all
I just want it all, yeah

I hope by now you're cool. (Cool)
Apologies from this fool
Had used and abused you, as usual
I usually don't run back to boos
But I made an exception for you. (Hey yeah)
I hope that you take my ring, turn it
And say "Heavenly blessing come true." (Hey yeah)
Like when I first slid in your DMs
And quickly start texting with you. (Hey yeah)
50 LOLs later we laid up, I'm sexing on you. (Hey yeah)
You say I'm the best and I knew that
And I don't apologize much
So when I say sorry. (Hey)
Say it's ok and hit me on my line
When I say call me. (Hey)
Pay them thots hoes never no mind
They aren't important. (Hey)
And leave that big-head nigga alone
I swear he so corny
To me he seems boring
Tell me this ain't the nigga you ran to
When I was out touring
Do you like all this salt that I'm pouring?
Fuck yo man, and fuck 'just friends.'
I apologize for tryna fuck your friend
Look boo, I just apologized again
Come here, closer, as I massage your skin
Little bit closer, I lay a kiss on your neck
Then a kiss on your lips
Now put you hand on my dick
I know you ain't finna leave all of this, (hey)
Last time I checked, you need all this dick. (Hey)

I know I'm so bold, but I'm the same nigga. (Hey)
Tell your homegirl to bounce cuz she came with you. (Hey)
She's probably finna say that I'm a lame nigga, (hey)
But she ain't say the same when that thang hit her. (Hey)
She'll go blame the alcohol, or blame niggas. (Hey)

Ugh!

[Hook: Sunny]
Feet in the water
Feels safe so let it go
Throw on a record
Feels good so let it flow

[Verse 1: DRAM]
When my feet hit the H20
I might say that it's way too cold to dive in
I'm striving I swear
But I'd rather you float me in
Come and go with me
You got a show to see
And I'm singing
Come and talk to me
CC Jodeci
A little Marco Polo ain't hurt nobody
Eyes closed, you gotta listen to find me
When you get what I'm spitting you get me
A+ for the written assignment
Footprints in the water at our secret little swimming pool
Waving like a pro cause I've been learning since like middle school

[Hook: Sunny]
Feet in the water
Feels safe so let it go
I got the kindle
I know where we can go
Feels good so let it flow
Throw on a record
Feels good so let it flow

[Verse 2: DRAM]
I want my feet up in the water
Telling me to let it go
I wonder who you're swimming with when I'm not around
Can (?) calm it down
I'm all up in this water
You telling me to dive in
I wonder what it is about myself that gets you wet
I wonder if it wasn't (?) swims

[Bridge: Sunny]
You know, I know
We know we won't let it go
I know, I know
You won't say no
We know, I know
You know we can't let it go
I know, I know
You can't say no

[Pre-Hook: DRAM]

[Hook: Sunny]
Feet in the water
Feels safe so let it go
I got the kindle
I know where we can go
Feels good so let it go
Throw on a record
Feels good so let it flow

[Outro: DRAM]
This amazing since babies
Wondering if I just left
Daisys I was chasing
My (?) with you, oh
The perfect
Cause don't know that you've got
The truth, right now
You know you bad
You know I want it bad
You know that I'm (?), yeah



[Verse: D.R.A.M.]
I'll fuck you all night but I don't love you though
I love my old bitch but she'll cut you though
She will wave a knife around just to let you know
My mommy told me leave alone them messy hoes
Okay I'm clean, okay I'm fresh
I'm sharp, I'll cut ya ho
Molly came with me but nigga what you asking for
Said if you trynna meet it and you need some dough
Don't come around her broke, or she'll tell you no
Hands off the wheel, out the sunroof
Sipping hundred proof, chasing with Yosemite
So you know I'm through
Every time I ride by they like
"Where you going to?"
Catch me out getting like I'm rich, living comfortable
I beg my mama will they let me chill in the Escalade
Drive that ho around, they told me no cause I be smoking man
Keep the blunt powered and the rag for the ash tray
Put my shit on wax and now its buzzing every which way
Bitch I'm switching lanes, driving fast on the interstate
On my way to a slice of cake to split with Auntie May
I'ma wear a plain white tee to the Grammys man
Accept all my awards in some Fords or some Taylor Gangs
Or matter of fact some slippers bitch I slide, I don't walk through
If you want the norm then I'm the wrong one to talk to
I might bring back Evisus, with the 'M' on them
If you ain't fucking with the kid D.R.A.M., that's a big problem
I love my old bitch but she will cut you though
I was dropping beads of sweat, she had it by my throat
I put her in a chicken wing like a fucking pro
And I fuck you all night but I don't love you ho
Baby bring some Game Silvers from the corner store
I already got a pack but I'ma need some more
Hey, and yeah I'm from the south but I don't get you though
Even though I'm big and dreaded and my teeth is gold



[Intro]
Yo, what happened to this shit, ho?
Keep going, it sounded great!

Tell Fatima that my sneaker that I paid too much from Neiman's...
Gotta... gotta flow, gotta flow
Gotta go, gotta go
And my only first time puttin' these mothafuckas on
I only have eyes on my clothes
I love my clothes like I love my girl that I hold close at night
I got so many clothes in there it'll make you lose your mind
I got suitcases and suitcases and shoelaces upon shoelaces
Two options, but I keep the ones in
Blue faces, blue faces, I got...
I got Fear of God, I got Prada
I got Gucci on, I got Balenciaga, but they did me wrong
I'm waitin' for I can get my discount on
I'm waitin', man, I'm addicted to these clothes, dawg
I'm addicted to wearin' 'em at my shows, dawg
Wearin' 'em out every time I step out, wearin' it
All times of the day, I be in the house fresh like
Why the fuck is he doin' that shit? You don't know what happened next
Might be somethin', ill happened
Grab out your phone and look at your fabrics
Them shits is good, your gold is glowin', nigga, you got it
Them shits is good, your juice is glowin', nigga, you got it
Dammit, bruh, dammit, bruh, dammit, bruh
Remember when I used to eat them made sandwiches
From my mama like it was lunch, made, lunch, made
I was at the shipyard [?]
I brush and roll, brush and roll
That brush and roll
12 dollars [?] 12 fucks, that's right before the tax
You know that they 'bout to take 1/6th of that
Oh, Uncle Sam

I only have eyes for my clothes

I got rent on, I got all that shit, bitch I'm famous
I don't know it though, I roll down the window like what's up?
People come inside, they be lookin' like, "what's that, bruh?"

Yo, I had walked up in the...
Yeah the chicken spot up in the city
Jersey City spot is right outside New York City
Where they're tryna get a little cheaper, but it's gritty
I was with my lil' bitty, with my lil' bitty
I was tryna go out, tryna be my own
Sometimes I don't wanna have these fuckin' people out here
Thinkin' that I'm just a superstar, so well known
That I don't know how to walk like people walked back in the days
In their shell toes
[?] change your ways, nigga, hell no
Anyways, we walked up in the chicken joint
And that girl tapped her man like
"Bae, that's the boy that did that song, that one song
That "I be on that fuck shit," they sing along
The one our kids like, the one that niggas fight up in the club
Because it gets hype
And nigga stepped up on your Nikes, they ones
Them ones you just got yesterday, them new Air Force Ones
Them Fresh Wipes, you know you can't even get the scuff up off them
[?] fuck up off you
Sometimes that shit [?] problems"
I was just tryna make music to make the people do it
I seen somebody gettin' moved to my fuckin' music
Moved [?] pain involved
But I was like I seen the pain, but just stay at home
The next song is gon' make you feel like a ray of sun
The next song is gon' make you think about your one
Even if you're still lookin' for that very one
You gon' have this to know that [?]

Notice how we be floatin'
Tellin' me I got the juice
My reply, "nah it's the potion"
Why you think we [?]
Water got the [?]
Wavin', crashin' big boatin'
But so what if you can't stump that motion you feel me
That's wavin'
Goldens in my mouth, they say I'm talkin' funny
How ironic, you only one who think that broke is funny
What says a lot of things like for when you hungry
Accountable for all of my words so all I speak is money
OGs told me when you speak it's like they froze and listen
I said you right, it's these golds, and they froze and glisten
Stop, look and wait, nah you just need to listen
But why the look? It's what I call carryin' on tradition
Very rare wave, no we don't do Reggie things
It's over 70% of the Earth we cover everything
That's for the wave, and what you speak, it's for the dub
It's my word, I said we goin' to shine so I iced all the ice, slums shinin' real fast
Wait, something snapped, cuz everybody's talkin' bout facts
What we know for knockin' down barriers
Last time I ran we was round, man we let the [?] crack
We train in different places, not just where we at
Lil weed here, eyein' places on the map
The T.S.O. dot for my Illmatic still
And for real, you not them you can pardon my back
That's word to my maker, maker
We don't do favors
'Specially if you ain't got paper
Wanna let this be known now
For the ones comin' with they hands out
Man I'm all outta favors, waiver
Now boy section 8 houses
Eviction notices, old school, dirty couches
Made a long way from plottin' food in the mouths
Now we plottin' that, puttin' gold in the mouths

[Outro: D.R.A.M.]
Get you some grills, bitch



[Verse 1]
Seen a nigga talkin' bout me like a dog
I seen a nigga change up, ask a nigga for a song
I done seen a bitch cry
Two months later she on all my D
I see KK nigga, my homie got a 30 shot Glock
Heard she a bitch that love to get cock
All that lumpin' and bumpin', you know the bitch hot
I made it cool to be a fat boy
I'm on your bitch like a frat boy
Fuckin' whats yours, cigarillo guts hit the floor
For lousy, Kill for that noise
Stroke right, all night, plumber with the long pipe
Hundred band juug on my HP
You should see what one click takes me
Worldwide web I'm boomin' worldwide
When she saw the boomin' caught your girls eye
Get you a slice of this humble pie
Made from the fruit of my loins, and my fruit of my loom
Get no fuck wit'
Probably cause you stay on fuck shit
I be high on my drunk shit, all of the functions
On a bitch that can barely function
I love this life I live, I came from a triflin' lil city
In a city I never been to, and they fuckin' with me
Cause the "Cha Cha" frenzy
Yeah thats wavy

[Hook]
Ride the wave, the wave
I don't ask for features, I get asked for em
Niggas mad, postin' raps up on these forums
Say I'm Hollywood, I'm actin' foreign
I should make the next nigga feel out of form
As far as love, I never had none for him

[Verse 2]
Cause I was puttin' in work while them hoes was snorin'
I was puttin' in work while you bitches snorin', yeah yeah
Kick in the shit with my good shoes on
Run in the town, my ass sat down, I'm a kingpin
These things that are said about me, are truthful
Every word I do mean, school these malnourished souls
Til they're barely hot, years, they volunteers
Witness how jelly rock
Too hot to handle like a pot from the bottom
I was deprived of nothing, still had to start from the bottom
Ain't it something how I used music to channel my problems
Like a [?] cable remote with no [?] to quote
And I'm the latest to post, like a slow ass sinna
But when you pass me that rock, I bet that shit goes inward
C-notes and benji's
Benihanas for dinners, sexy mamis for quickes
Slangin' wood with no splinters
We wolves plus winners
We out here building this wave, you wanna ride but you cain't
We out the building, its wavy

[Hook]
I don't ask for features, I get asked for em
Niggas mad, postin' raps up on these forums
Say I'm Hollywood, I'm actin' foreign
I should make the next nigga feel out of form
As far as love, I never had none for him
Cause I knew they never had none for me
Cause niggas sleepin', I was workin'
Yeah yeah run this

[Interlude]
Shoutout to [?], we finna kill this shit

Get the fuck up off my back about these bars and shit man
Fuck that shit, uh alright

[Verse 3]
Nigga don't get it twisted
Unless its weed in the blunt lemme hit it
While I'm screamin' fuck rap to you niggas
I'm passed finished with you
Black and mild smokin', reggie chokin'
Gotta be jokin' think you fuckin' with D.R.A.M
I'm napalm from Vietnam, dropping bombs for the dope
I send (?) they had no clue I had flow
But I'm cool with that tho
I used to tag the toes of dudes with no soul
While they shoes was still on, is that so?
So the fuck what?
These numb nuts ain't worth the attention
Who want a feature cause I'm working and winning
Oh yeah I get it, it's no (?) help with your vision
So how you so ready to work if you not ready for spending
I need c-notes and Benzes
This Benihana delicious
I got your bitch in my (?)
You should pay way more attention
Think I hit my top speed but I'm just revving my engine
Fuck (?) came to me, bitch I (?) to go get it, nigga
And this me having bars shit

[Verse 4]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, DRAM man
Somebody said I wasn't there yet
Well nigga where the fuck am I at?
(?)
Niggas act like I ain't the man
Rejecting the same jam that turn they ass to McMahon
So fall back with these preconceived notions like
Yeah I think you stupid
I just feel he needs focus
Like I read with bifocals
Nigga I be going postal like mailman when the dog is loose
Soon as you pass the gate they try to bite and bark at you
Overcame obstacles
Triple at the ones that rhyme like Doctor Suess
Left these niggas hanging dead without a noose
They (?)
Truth be told I knew I had the it factor since two years old
While all these commentating, sidelining, quick riding, dick pirating
Sail the ocean blue to get screwed and your bitch like it
Play this shit on Sunday, play the dick on Monday
Wax on, she snap the pussy back and make it one way

[Interlude 2]
Motherfucker don't you ever get it fucked up bruh, it's DRAM nigga. I'm here, I'm not going nowhere, not gonna get me the fuck out of here bruh. All this time I done got damn, what? Shit?

[Verse 5]
Play this shit on Sunday, play the dick on Monday
Wax on, she snap the pussy back and make it one way
With the (?) like a cold cut, so what?
2014 model, I don't give no fucks
No fucks given, I'm dripping and drive you crazy
I'm saying I'm fucking dope, I'm a product of 1980's
'88 to be exact, dread headed, kinda fat
Sturdy nigga, nerdy nigga, how can y'all compete with that?
Steady nigga flow is working hard to bring the reaper back
Cutting niggas racks as they be asking how we (?) with that
Rare, rare, very rare
Everybody well aware
That I've been such an underdog I got all these pussies scared
That I done made the greatest album on some Biggie shit
And I'ma own up to that, maybe just a little bit
Nigga feel like dipping molly, prolly just a little hit
25 years ago I used to look so innocent
25 years later still ain't seen a prison yet
1 year after that, I'm the greatest artist living bitch

[Interlude 3]
I own up to that statement bruh, come on man, don't do that bruh, like don't do that. All this motherfucking I've been putting in man. Shit ain't never gonna stop, one year after that I'm the greatest

[Verse 6]
Picasso couldn't paid this picture better
(?) in my system plus a (?) cigarello, white widow
I inhale like Whitney, I exhale like Whitney
And RIP to Whitney but y'all must be on that Whitney
If you think you can get with me
I am liquor to your kidneys
I am cancer from them ciggies
I am death, I have just been digging these holes beyond
Niggas hoes with no flows at all
My rapid mic strike take flight, that's the protocol
Calling all true rhyme sayers to the chopping block
Cutting off this (?), everybody get chopped
Anybody doubt me then that anybody smoking rock
Pitiful or (?) probably sell they mama's clothes to cop
30 thou to open up shop, nigga no you're not
I'm taking shit down, snatch your crowns over (?) spots
Throw the records out cause you're tired I done wrote the dope
Cassius Clay serving pope, presidential solid hope

[Outro]
Motherfucker, it's DRAM nigga. Does Real Ass Music, nigga don't do that bruh. Don't take me from this bruh, it's my life bruh. Every day I wake up and think about this man. Fuck out of here, half the city a product of that, VA, 2 up, 2 down



[Verse 1:BigBabyMom]
City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
(Of Christmas)

[Bridge: BigBabyMom]
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile (Smile after smile)
And on every street corner you'll hear

[Chorus: BigBabyMom]
Woah those silver bells (Silver bells)
Silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Verse 2: Dram]
Strings of street lights
Even stoplights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures

[Verse 3: Dram]
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big day
And above all this bustle you'll hear

[Chorus: BigBabyMom]
Woah those silver bells (Silver bells)
Silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Ah baby that's DRAM

Long print silk with the chest hairs out
Circle I rest with these golds in my mouth
I fuck with (?) for keeping hoes in they house
It's a fucking bachelor pad, it's what it's supposed to be bout
I be chilling at my cuz spot high as a fool
In this little back room and the light bulb dull
And I ain't Young Thug but I'ma ask for the hookah
I'ma be geriatric, still coughing off buddha
With a kango hat and the (?) real cute
With the old school jewelry and the tear drop booty
Baby when I do ya, I'ma do ya

That's a mind fuck
I wish that I could stay baby but time is up
Ya gotta go, ya gotta go, soon as I nut

Everything around you became suddenly unreal as if it were a dream

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world
[?]
I think 'bout you and the times we had
But you keep [?] too much
I lift you up in my lap
I started touching you on the balcony
I touched you in the party [?]

[Verse 2]
[?] no more
I don't feel like sleeping no more, but I'm tired
Eyes wide the fuck open, I'm strokin'
My ego, but molly keep fuckin' up the peephole
I'm tryin' hard to see you
I'm blind, fuckin' up around these people that I just met
So I'm stuck around my boo, I'm new amongst the crew
But then she turns on me, turns me to a suspect
What's next?

[Hook]
I'm never gettin' fucked up again
Never gettin' fucked up again
Never gettin' fucked up again

[Hook]
I'm never gettin' fucked up again
Never gettin' fucked up again
Never gettin' fucked up again
It's my last time, my very last time



One more time, woah

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

Cause they know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
From kids to one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, Merry Christmas to you

That Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
From kids to one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Merry Christmas to you



[Intro]
Alright, woah, oh
You too, baby

[Verse 1]
Girl, how did we get under the mistletoe?
But if I kissed your lips, how far would this here go?
Now you can give me gift, underneath the tree
But the greatest gift is if you spend the night with me

[Chorus]
I'll be makin' love this Christmas, love this Christmas
Love this Christmas, to you
Makin' love this Christmas, love this Christmas
Love this Christmas, to you

[Verse 2]
Protect the one that I'll [?] from me
How sweet you touch my heart
I want to touch your body too
So won't you let me come and do
Everything you deserve
'Cause when it's cold outside
Baby, you light my fire

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll be makin' love this Christmas, love this Christmas
Love this Christmas, to you
Makin' love this Christmas, love this Christmas
Love this Christmas, to you

Bitch it's that fire
I'm twisting that dope like bitches and yoga

And we got powers cause my plug plugged in

Out of pocket and you still dug in
Came up with nothing

Fell back for a (?) Tec
Finna free Timmy Caine

Strong weed and the bitch in the house
Fatass, big tits, and no blouse
And molly to dip in the (?)
Rolling around
All I gotta pay is 45 for the grammy
Took a grammy and some mo to New York, we was gold
I've been slurring cause that potion got it hard to understand me
When you filled up with that (?) I DRAM up for your mammy
Word around the town is that I'm hydronic
And you heard the same thing ain't that ironic
That thing there ain't a hit unless I'm on it
And this right here a hit cause I'm on it
Whenver I'm on E, I ride around for that gas
I can't settle, I'm never glad when it's bags of trash
In the ghetto is where I can the (?) my cash
And blow that spit out and (?) when (?) bitches drive past

[Hook]
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke that shit, yoga fire
Roll that shit, stretch that shit, flip that shit, yoga fire
It's so good when that shit hit your lips, yoga fire
You got piff? That ain't this, hit that shit, yoga fire
Yoga fire, it's that yoga fire
Yoga fire, it's that yoga fire
Yoga fire, yoga fire

To the nearest alley way so I can roll up weed
In Soho NYC
The best things in this life are free
I rode a horse on the fort it changed my life for me

[Hook]

Part II: The Space Record

[Hook]
What you looking down for?
(Man free my nigga Shawn P)
I'm on the upper echelon
It's only one way up from here
(Free my nigga Mike)
And I think we passed high
(Most definitely free my nigga Tim)
I think that we had passed that
When we crossed the stratosphere
I went too hard to stack that
(Can't tell us what the motherfucking fuck to do)
I want to go to space, I want to go to space, I want to go to space

[Verse 1: Timmy!]
I used to be a dead kid
Man I swear shit done changed
Now I take 'em to the bank and blowing shot guns like bang
I won't stop I can't complain
Smell like this when I came in
The Cadillac with my nigga DRAM
Smoke 3 yum we came
Where I'm at you can't hang
Ain't no lames in my gang
Smoke up with your dame
A little head in the car
Might hit her with the chain like dang
My light like (?)
Got washed away when I rolled away
Swimming through outer space
Fuck it the hour rate
Only cause I'm light years away
I just blew a deck it away
And we upper echelons
So hard to look down on us
Turned up, turned up, turned down for what
Three drug minimum, I'm gone

[Hook]
What you looking down for?
We on the upper echelon
It's only one way up from here
And I think we passed high
I think that we had passed that
When we crossed the stratosphere
I want to go to space, I want to go to space, I want to go to space
I want to go to space, I want to go to space, I want to go to space
I want to go to space, I want to go to space, I want to go to space

[Verse 2: DRAM]
It's looking like I'm tired me and (?) still smoke it
Nigga we can't get no higher, uhm-hm
Kid tell 'em stay focused when you pass to him
Acid tray or acid sip
3 MP means pass the hit
Ugly blunts (?)
Vacation home on (?) got several bars
My reception till perfection I'm (?) of sour
Damn these are space fuel, pure gasoline
Smell this like lemonade poured in your valvoline
Get space it fly
But does it only glide
If it don't ride
I guarantee its cellphone has a lonely line
So much (?) get me to Pluto
We cooling on Neptune now
Cause I copped that 35 yesterday and I'm working on my last 2 now
Hm, if I'm looking for it, it means I'm on a voyage
And if it's Chips Ahoy you can shift deploy
I see past the clouds and I can smell the sounds
And you come up here to visit just don't damn it down

[Hook]
What you looking down for?
We on the upper echelon
It's only one way up from here
And I think we passed high
I think that we had passed that
When we crossed the stratosphere
I want to go to space, I want to go to space, I want to go to space
I want to go to space, I want to go to space, I want to go to space
I want to go to space, I want to go to space, I want to go to space

[Outro]
I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll, I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll
I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll, I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll
To space is where I'm bout to go
To space is where I'm bout to go
I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll, I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll
I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll, I smoke, I drink, I dip out roll
To space is where I'm bout to go
To space is where I'm



Hook- Big bang big bang big bang big bang started something
I research space so you can’t tell me nothin
Yea it’s up to something yea it’s up to something
I learned the universe is expanding and it might erupt or something
I know the universe is really old like 13.7 bill
It's mixed  with cataclysm yea it generates still
That means that its building galaxies all through outta space
And you know the earth expanding it ain't gonna erase
Inflation expands the universe with energy
Creating our galaxy so I can be me

Verse 1 :
The reason I’m alive, is not easy to describe
From the theory to the hydrogen and helium collide
Big bang made the stars, the solar system and earth
Big bang is the fastest growing baby since birth

Verse 2:
All that radiation left over in space
Energy left all over the place
I said the earth's history is cray
Big bang big bang big bang
