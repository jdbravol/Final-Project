Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm reliving moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building, take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you and touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard, the diamonds yours
The coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)

I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated

[Intro: NAV]
That coca

[Chorus: NAV]
I just poured an 8 in a liter
Throw some Jolly Ranchers in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snorting three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rolling off Molly
Got a white bitch snorting up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (that coca)
She said she want more
She said she want more
So I'ma get more
Yeah, I'ma get more
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose
She said she want more
She said she want more
So I'ma get more
Yeah, I'ma get more

[Verse 1: NAV]
I just poured a 8 in a liter
Got a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you want to party with the demons?
Bitch looking for a phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost bring the water, no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in their feelings
'Cause their main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more
Your girl is a ho, you need to let go
She fucked all my bros, she's snorting the snow (that coca)
Now she's touching her toes
She got Anna Nicole all in her nose
If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more
Fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

[Verse 2:  Travis Scott]
Nightmares, high life, sleepy, night-night (yah)

White—bitch, bitch—, she thick  (bitch)
Pulled out of the hood Toyota
Drove back to the hood Lambo (ooh)
Crushed Xans, crushed Xans in my soda
Riding around the city with my eyes closed (yah, yah)
Crazy Girls got it popping, AOD got it popping (yah, yah)
Tryna text my accountant
Ain't no service in the mountains (straight up)
Won't you come to the bottom?
Know you heard a lot about 'em (yah)
Heard they take that, then they change like a mood ring (yah, yah)
I watched 'em take that, then they change like a mood ring
Pulled out of the hood Toyota
Drove back to the hood Lambo (ooh)
Crushed Xans, crushed Xans in my soda
Riding around the city with my eyes closed (ooh)

One time for the trill bitches that'll let me touch it

Flyin' through, I got a young 'Yoncé with a Iggy on her
Me and Metro do the same drugs, got a lot of it
All these cups and damn, all these hoes, these niggas up to somethin'
Touch down out in H-Town, there it might get ugly

In a black Mercedes with her
Doin' about 180 with her
I was born a hustler, paraphernalia in my baby pictures
Resident all eloquent, leather shit in my front yard
TV by my swimming pool, got that built like a sports bar
Chevelle with a new motor, got the bitch like a sports car
Yeah, my name is Tity Boi, I don't fuck with hoes that wear sports bras (Nah!)

[Intro]
(Harmonizing)

[Hook]
I try it if it feels right
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets better, the night gets brighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Harmonizing)

[Verse]
We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin'
I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options
I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your momma never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose

[Hook]
I try it if it feels right (ohh)
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets better, the night gets nighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Harmonizing)

[Bridge]
Shit, I try it if it feels nice
Shit, this kinda feels nice
Mm-mhm, mhm, ay
Miles and miles away

[Outro]
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move
I know you wanna dance
I know you gettin' ready to
Take the night away
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move
I know you wanna dance
I know you’re gettin' ready to
Chase the night away (ooo)



Part I

[Intro: Travis Scott & Kacy Hill]
(Dean, what's poppin'? Yo, Travis)
Mhm, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Mama's bailing down that road, craving 9021...

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
She a porn star girl, oh, from the valley
(Honestly, God bless)
Who left her hometown world all for the alley
Oh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties
(I hope it was wet like my jumper, though)
Ooh, used to take the long way home
Long way home, all for that candy, mm

[Bridge: Kacy Hill]
Baby's hooked on feeling numb
Do, do, do, do, doo

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Jacques turn La Flame, now he rolling on an Addy
50 on a chain, another 50 on a Caddy, oh
He might pop him a pill, pop him a seal, pop anyone
Pop anything, pop anything to find that alley
Hmm, yeah, then find an alley, mm

[Bridge: Kacy Hill]
Baby's hooked on feeling numb
Don't look down now
Don't look down

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Kacy Hill]
In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley
In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley, ooh
It's the superstar girl, superstar girl, roaming in that alley
Baby's hooked on feeling numb
In the 90210, 90210, somewhere in that alley

Part II

[Verse 3]
My granny called, she said "Travie, you work too hard
I'm worried you'll forget about me"
I'm falling in and out of cuffs
Don't worry, I'mma get it, granny
What happened? Now my daddy happy, mama called me up
That money coming and she love me, I done made it now
I done found life's meaning now
All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now
Friends turning into fraud niggas
Practicing, have the passion, you niggas packaged different
All you niggas, you niggas want the swag, you can't have it
I'mma sell it, you niggas salary 'bout to cap bitch
Youngest nigga outta Houston at the Grammys
Smiling at 'em laughing at me
I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked and passed it back, bitch
All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin
Yeah, mmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Cuzzo said we in the store, yeah, we 'bout to drop a 4
He pass the cigarette, I choke
Tell my auntie put them ports down, them ports down
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin' nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em
Good lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Distant sky, from north of the border my chips is in order
My mom's biggest supporter so now niggas support a nigga

Don't you fall asleep this time

Only you can stand my mind
Only you can fix inside
So if I make it out tonight
Let's make it a badass time

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Okay, I got it, copy
20/20, but I can't see nobody
One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me
Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies
No, that wasn’t my girl, that was just a hobby
Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby
Elevator up, no need to find me
Yeah, yeah
X-ray vision, see through you niggas
Newspaper stand, we press the issue
We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles
Right up at your hood up north
Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental
Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals
Cookin' on a tune, I been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat
Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet
Gotta watch my back now, cause these niggas at me
All black in a Benz when I pull up on you

[Hook: Travis Scott]
They don't want to see me in the ends, in the ends
Let me catch you creeping here past 10, in the ends
From a tribe of check-a-hoe like Indian
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Eh, to them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter
I guess it's all survival but please be careful
I gave up on the Bible long time ago
I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids
And dumped them in the creek up from where I live
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza
And said he had a label recruitin' people
Put that on my grandma and everythin'
My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me or could've been you too
What a memory in me, needing to lose
What's gon' patch up my inner tube
So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Oh yeah, La Flame with the nappy fro now
In the ends, I'mma kick your door down
Oh yeah, we keep wildin' out the Mo' now
Oh yeah, keep that 300 zero when I pull up on ya

Despite you got flaws
Just let our love play, its course
Let you tell it, what's mine is yours, what's yours is yours
All the signs I ignored
I play love like a sport

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
First take
You ain't on time, you were late
When you around me, you're safe
You can't go off of a heresay
I know that look on your face
You think you winnin' a race
You think all I do is play
I didn't put you in your place
Then why you still here in my place?
Thought so, so, and also
You think too much, we all know
You think too much, we all know
I ain't tryna go back to war with your morals
You can't kill the vibe, it's immortal (straight up)
I ain't buyin' it even though I can afford ya (ooh)
'Cause I know...

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Don't like what I saw
This life without yours
Despite I was lost
Despite you got flaws
Just let our love play its course
Let you tell it
What's mine is yours, what's yours is yours
All the signs I ignored
I play love like a sport

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
This love won't grow 'less we find growth
White on your nose, girl
Won't you come over?
Let's both find hoes
Let's fuck them both
But you think too hard, we all know
You think too hard, we all know
So say nothin', nothin'
'Cause you think too hard, we all know
You know I'd rather lead it than follow
You and me, baby, mano y mano
Cause I know, I know

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Bryson Tiller]
Don't like what I saw (yeah)
This life without yours (yeah, yeah)
Despite I was lost (ayy)
Despite you got flaws (ayy)
Just let our love play its course (ohhh)
Let you tell it
What's mine is yours, what's yours is yours (all is yours)
All the signs I ignored (uh, huh)
I play love like a sport (like a sport, no, yeah)

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller & Travis Scott]
Okay, lil mama
I still ain't heard from lil mama
We go back to Angliana
When you was studying in college
But I called you and brought you
Out to Santa Monica
Believed in you, I was your sponsor
I got love for you, but I'm not in love
Gave me affection
Girl, I was lost, she gave me direction
Went through fuckin' you with no protection
All my blessings
Girl, you one of all my blessings
You think I don't care about you?
Girl, you better call my best friend
I got time to waste
Girl I got time to waste
Girl, I cancelled everything
Just to get back on the same page
To finish the story
But you would rather ignore me
Your mama called to check on me
But you won't even pick up the phone, shit
God damn, you feelin' yourself
Out in Hollywood, you got a nigga with some wealth
You ain't free tonight, I bet he call somebody else
Tryna tell you I'm the last real nigga left
You can hit me if you need help
With your love problems, with your money problems
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em

[Outro: Bryson Tiller]
Just call me or you could just pick up the phone, baby
I know, I know you're home, baby
Baby, I know, I know

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Oh-ohh, don't pray for love
Oh-ohh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Weeknd]
Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Oh-ohh, don't pray for love
Oh-ohh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Pills
Have you ever been through life's
Challenges? Promises? Promises?
Get down, heartbreak

[Verse 2: Travis Scott and The Weeknd]
Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks (just ask the lonely)
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (just ask the lonely)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow (just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love

[Bridge: The Weeknd & Travis Scott]
No, oooo
We don't pray for love, no more, no more
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton, no more
We don't wanna see you on the news, no more
All alone
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, yeah

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she want to be wife
She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax faster than a hi-hat
Sorry baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Oh-ohh, don't pray for love
Oh-ohh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh



[Intro: Matty Healy]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No! He's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Hook: Travis Scott]

I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Know I need my dollars
Know a nigga need my commas
She was down when I dropped out of college
Down, she was down when I rode Impalas
Played with her pussy in the Jeep
Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin'
Jumped in the car when she hit my digits
Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects
Easy to me my nigga
Villa with a scene, youngin' always seen with a killer
Hand stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela?
She even got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off
Ain't it been a minute since they seen a weird nigga
From the corner put it on for the south?
On my momma, know a nigga be coasting
Go nigga, go nigga grab my bottles
Go nigga, go nigga grab my chronic
Keep ya head up in the air my nigga
Niggas gon' be billionaires my nigga
Fuck how much time that shit might take
Niggas ain't playin' with 'em!
(Playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em!)

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas

B.I.G Sean Don, my aura gold, you know it
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Bitch don't you play me, don't you try me
I need the exact amount
Look at my face, ho, eye-to-eye me
I'm a boss, make sure you and your homies dress up, tight attire
When you see me, ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it
I mean, goddamn, nigga!
You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these bitches is bitches and they ain't nuns
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow they act like they been down since day one
Where there's fuckin' tank guns
But niggas never join the army, like it ain't one
If I ain't got it then I'm huntin'
I'm either countin' or I'm cummin'
Swear I just done bought that mansion
Treat that shit like it's a dungeon
Up at 5AM still workin', but I treat it like it's 1
I'm never actin' like I got it
Bitch I'm actin' like I won it on these niggas!

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas

[Intro: T.I.]
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of "fuck this shit"
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch
And lead the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of they metamorphosis
Not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But whatever it is, it's better than here
So fuck you and fuck this

[Hook]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me, and come down with me
Yeah that's all I need in my fantasy

[Verse 1]
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'mma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

[Hook]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me, and come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy

[Interlude: T.I.]
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance
To say "fuck you" to the ones that say "fuck you"
Tell 'em do ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
La Flame, he hears in his head, the world is yours

[Verse 2]
Wake up nigga
Gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms
Might gotta got to rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy
'Cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis
'Cause my mind too outlandish
It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga, goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'mma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
Till I climb to the top of the podium
So wake up nigga
Gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm
Might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy
'Cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis
'Cause my mind too outlandish
We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
We gon' rule the world, hmm
(Never gonna stop, never gonna stop)
(Never ever gonna stop it)

[Outro: T.I.]
La Flame says "let your ambition carry you"



[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous
I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dukes, can't let them come through
I got shit to lose
Hold up wait, more to gain, more at stake
I got shit to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them

Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
And I never liked it, and I never liked them

[Verse: Travis Scott]
You know what, we grew on
We go back like futons and coupons
We too bad, we too wild, we too young
Shake some, my niggas gon' shake some
Fall through and break somethin'
Broad day, and take somethin'
Backwards, I've been livin' backwards
On my mattress, orgies on my mattress
Flashes, dreamin', havin' flashes
Dashin', hopin' I don't crash it

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous
I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dukes, can't let them come through
I got shit to lose
Hold up wait, more to gain, more at stake
I got shit to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you

[Chorus: Travis Scott + Cassie]
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew

Whoa
Let me tell you a little story about dis side
You really can't make it on dis side

Lit late night on dis side
You never come around past midnight
You miss everything on dis side

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Dis side, dis side
Dis side, dis side, dis side, dis side
Dis side, dis side
Dis side, dis side, yeah

Really miss the feeling of the late nights (late nights)
Shit we used to do around midnight (midnight)
Hangin' on the corner, had shit tight (shit tight)

Paid my dues on dis side
Flipping up bricks on dis side
I made it out the hood, I'm on the other side
All my niggas on dis side
Keep it one hundred on dis side
Love to get money on dis side
No new niggas on dis side
Look at my diamonds don't get blind
You better handcuff your ho with a zip tie (cuff!)
I will take a busta down on dis side
Broke niggas stand to the left side
"Handsome and Wealthy" on dis side
I came from the bottom
And now I'm on top, that's phenomenal (phenomenal)
Dis side, dis side, dis side, dis side
If I do not make it I wonder where I will go, oh
Dis side, dis side, dis side, oh
Graduated from the midget, woah
This the life I was living, woah
Graduated to a million, woah
It's the money that I'm getting, woah
Graduated from a hotbox
Now I'm ridin' 'round in a Bentley, skrrt, skrrt
This how we do it on

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Dis side, dis side, dis side
Always, always dis side
Dis side, dis side, dis side

You never come around past midnight
Midnight, midnight
You know how I like my lean, poured right
Just right, on dis side
Find everything you need, everything you need on dis side
Dis side, dis side, dis side, dis side



[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out)

Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, upper echelon

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Dozin' off them Xannies, just popped a bandie
Wave rock like Atlantic, froze like Atlantic
Party at the Sphinx, damn that's so outlandish
She gon' make it clap, clap, throw them bands
Walkin' through the Waldorf they know my name here
Dropped out, got signed, got mom house all in the same year
Don't you come around me, ain't got the time, B, naww
Watch me do the Randy, touchdown
Knew how much I get, think La Flame the golden child
Ridin' right behind her, pull up beside her
We poppin' champagne, damn you apple cider

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]

[Intro: Travis Scott]
She say your bad ass always had a thing for sweets
Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street
Won't you and your friends come eat with me
And let me show you how to whip that recipe
She say your bad ass always had a thing for sweets
Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street
Won't you come over and eat with me
And let me show you how to whip-whip-whip-whip that recipe

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
I don't want your apple pie, mama
I ain't tryna dap up niggas blockin' me
Made it out the spot, straight to quintana
And I'm still that nigga with diamonds on my blocka
I say when they come at me I bet they have some backup
I bet I take your bitch, she take that dick straight up the stasher
Keep an ounce of garlic just to keep away the Draculas
I just seek out to find my home, why can't they just leave me 'lone

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Cause I don't want your apple pie, no no mama
I don't want your apple pie, no
I don't want your apple pie, mama
I don't want your apple pie no more
I need my own pepper pepper, please, pepper, pepper seeds
Need my own reme-remedy, my own legacy
Yeah I don't want your apple pie, mama
I need my own pepper please
My own legacy, my own recipe

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I came to get it nominated
From a spot that y'all seen Bun B blow up
I hate to break your heart, I bet I'll make the mark
That y'all see a legacy go up
Goyard done break your pockets
Boy I'm out in Paris lettin' all these beats go up
I make in one appearance what these niggas hatin' makin' in four seasons
H-Town, know we gon' stunt
I'm for real and your Rollie tick
Look bitch, this the Rodeo
But I ain't goin' out for your bullshit
And I don't want your apple pie, mama
I don't wanna dap up niggas blockin' me
I am everything except a rapper
Shit I got it lit, 25 lighters on my dresser yeah

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Roxanne tonight

[Outro: T.I.]
Que será, será, so the story goes
On and on and back and forth, the evolution's absolute
Tours and shows and groupie whores
Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot
Though he'd rather not
Forever been the elephant in the room
That everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group
That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
Will he make it? Was it worth it?
Did he win? Will he survive the Rodeo?

Praise to the pope, bless you with this dope
Step into my world where we get ghost cause in my mind we float
Everytime we step into 1Oak, they tweaking off the coke
Fuck I'm out my mind, I'm burning bread so much let's have a toast
Cause my niggas and momma know
If I wasn't here, nigga I'd be dead
Now I'm in the building thinking billions
Counting millions, what a feeling
Remember when I never ever made shit?
Now me and my niggas rocking chains and whipping slave ships
Now who the slave bitch?

I'm unsociable with like most of them
Cause I don't socialize with them suckers, see?
Lyrically I will demolish
This is the nail in the coffin, niggas is soft
Niggas remind me of nails at a spa
So under-polished, novices
They barkin' up the wrong tree (double M)
Trust me if you with me then you goin' eat
I got them sweatin' like these bitches herein all day
And I'm off Atlantic, 2-1 rob 'em, bumbaclot, nigga
Not a P-O-K, I'm out for the VS
Get lifted, few zips like a Steep Tech
Use piff, short words for the loose girls
All mine's re-up, y'all regret
Don't worry 'bout my team, my team is set
Don't worry 'bout T, it's in depth
When it comes to the mothafuckin' c-notes
We’ll start us a mothafuckin' glee club
God damn...

[Bridge: A$AP Bari & Travis Scott]
La Flame, don't play no games

[Intro: Edna Wright]
Darling, when the moon is bright
I want you to be holding me tight

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Migo!
She see me pull up in that 'Rari
I'm thinkin' 'bout choppin' the toppy
Got bitches on bitches, they run 'round the lobby
They know that I got it
I got too much money signs, sorry can't fit in my wallet
Sloppy toppy, you can't touch my wallet
Sloppy toppy know the bitches got it
Know that she got it, know that she got it (What she got huh?)
Sloppy toppy, sloppy toppy, uh
Know that she got it, know that she got it
Sloppy toppy, bet the bitch has got it
Sloppy toppy, bet that bitch has got it

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Migos they know that I got it
Know that my wristwatch is sloppy
Now they want a double dutch in my pockets
Tell me one thing, is she 'bout it? Girl is you 'bout it?
Gotta know before we let you tip toe and run through the lobby (fuck is you sayin'?)
But the little bitty told me sloppy toppy was a hobby
So she got me sloppy toppy like the sloppy toppy Goddess
Over the garden, over the garden, oh what a goddess
On my province, we don't do massages, just "ménages"
She like to talk shit when we fuck, after she claims she forgot it
She don't tap out, no tap out, she rather just black out
Then we take trips to her trap house
We been pullin' them stacks out
Call over your friends, bend over, they poppin' for bands
Can't stop if I can, no I do not do beer cans, fuck is this a frat house?

[Bridge: Travis Scott & Quavo]
I know that she got it, Quavo know that she got it
I know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Quavo!
I pull up and pick her up, get her bruh
I know that she bad
And I know that the head is so good when she got around
I know that we call her the sloppy toppy
My pockets so sloppy
I pull out the whopper, the chopper
Just know that's who shot ya
Me, pull up in that 'Rari I don't have a key
She hop in the whip, disappear like a genie

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
She got the sloppy toppy, bitches want my broccoli
She after my money, Monopoly
Them twitter bitches wanna follow me
I make 'em swallow me then kick 'em off of my property
Paparazzi keep on stalkin' me
Feel like the Federali's keep on watchin' me
Worth 100 mil, niggas can't talk to me
Get sloppy toppy, but you givin' currency
I make your bitch work for me, she at the Doubletree
Chopping strong, OG gas bags of that Hercules
I'm whipping the top off the Audi, do surgery
Red on the bottom, my shoes it's a murder scene
I don't want your bitch she a natnat
Pull up in the Audi, it's a hatchback
Kickin', pimpin' and I'm luxury livin'
Makin' it disappear, I'm a magician

[Hook: Quavo]
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it

[Verse 5: PeeWee Longway]
Sloppy in the wrist and all my pockets
Come here lil bitch, I want sloppy toppy
Butt naked, fuckin' in Balenciaga
Her pussy wet, I call it Fiji water
I know she got it, I'ma beat it for her
Then I dismiss the bitch and ignore her
They know I got it, I'm at the top floor
Blue Benjamins on me, no dubs
Duffel bag filled up like I'm Money Mayweather
Boogers in my Rollie, Pikachu yellow
Pick a shoe, Balenci, Maison Margiela
Pick a big bezel, which bezel is better?
My jeweler know I got big cheddar
Double Lambo, double parking wherever
Double R ghost jump out with an umbrella
Come with me, we take off like space shuttles
Longway, Longway

[Hook: Quavo]
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it

Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it

[Verse 6: Offset]
Offset!
Sloppy toppy in the Maserati
She gone get on top me, ride me like a Harley
I don't fuck with the molly, look at her body
She a hottie like a bag of Takis
Beat the pussy like I'm Pacquiao
Squeeze the nipples like you milk a cow
Pull up in the car that she can't pronounce
Dick in her mouth, you'd think she got a root canal
30 thousand for her Birkin
Fat booty, shawty perfect
She gag on the dick and she burpin'
She swallow my kids like a slurpee
Good brains, she nerdy
I'm wonderin' what is her purpose
When I get around her I get nervous
Little momma, she clean like detergent

[Hook: Quavo]
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it

[Verse 1]
Midnight awakin', hyper ventilatin'
Drunk laps runnin' 'round the globe wild goose chasin'
After three number one albums woulda thought I'd feel amazin'
Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor
Still rollin' up swishas
Now its beamers double parking, fuck payin' the meter
In your club, on your couch, just got paid to be here
On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us, only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas

[Hook]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck around, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house

[Verse 2]
Around 3 AM dog
I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall
Bad mamacita, Miami heat her, put it in a two seater
Too bad I couldn't three peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper
House full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter
With more stamps than a skinny nigga got tats on my Visa
I know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it, I mean

[Hook]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck around, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house
Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck around, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stake out, on a farm or your lake house

[Interlude]
Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
I might fuck around, lose my mind

La Flame

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Walked in this bitch, I just got through finessin' designer (straight up)

Rolling with my team, yeah we all finessing

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Man, here it go, fishcale, A1 perico
Fill PJ's up with kilos, then sell it like it's legal, yeah
Everybody he know, could have gotten hit with the RICO
Caught a couple of charges, they were weak though
Feds had to let him go in a week or so
Still, still need the key to blow
Whole heap of dough, ran the streets for so long
Man the team was so on, damn it seem like so long
Ago, we had 'em in Mexico
He tryna' make it back, three bricks more
The people always run up on us in Texas though
Only by the grace of God they ain't catch us though
Some lil' young nigga with some big dreams
Almost on the verge of doing some big things
Tryna' get a bird since he was sixteen
And now he playin' ‘round with fifteen or more, ay
You know a nigga love nice things
And the price in the hood is too frightening
Them niggas ain't gon' do the right thing
It’s time for me to do my thing (hey!)

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Finessing, finessing (straight up)
I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame)
Finessing, finessing (bando)
I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing (straight up, straight up)
Finessing, finessing (straight up)
I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame)
Finessing, finessing

[Outro: Travis Scott]
How high?
Tell me why she wanna leave me
She used me to get high
Oh she used me to get higher, higher, higher
So tell me why she wanna leave me?
Ooooh, ooooh, oooh, ooh-oooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
As the days go on, the southern region of our national anthem
The quest for La Flame, this journey, it's the last days



[Intro: Kanye West]
Yo, yo, yo
I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
This one here for the executives, fuck you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, nigga behave
Nigga behave, nigga behave

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Us niggas, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave, got treated like slaves
Young niggas treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waitin' for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, "Bitch, get back in the door"
I've been comin' up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it
Momma, momma, look at little Scotty now
The same fuckers that used to doubt
All preachin' that they proud
I pull my zipper down and whip it out

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave
Turn this up, teacher
Play this in the third grade in the third grade
Can't hide from the truth
Yeah, we're 'bout to go ape, we're 'bout to go ape
These streets is not safe
These niggas ain't playin', these niggas ain't playin' (huh)
These niggas ain't playin'
This for my fam, this for the fam, do this for the fam
Hop outta the Lamb', hop onto the 'gram what the fuck was you sayin'?
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave, piss in your grave
I'll piss in your face, I'll piss on your bitch, I'll piss on your date (huh)
Fuck is you sayin'? Fuck is you sayin'? Fuck is you sayin'?
Me and La Flame, is you not entertained?



[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
10 am, it’s Ransomnia
She see the glass, it's so obvious
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth, but can't eat right?
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
SMH, we all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, 'cause you'll never know
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs
Her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs
It should be here with me
Here is where her heart

[Break: Teyana Taylor & John Legend]
I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away

[Verse 2: Malik Yusef]
You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city

[Verse 3: CyHi the Prynce]
Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, boy I'm tied like an ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is and he never hung with the Saints
It makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs
Her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs
It should be here with me
Here is where her heart

[Verse 4: Malik Yusef]
And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss, but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life

You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
I can tell ‘bout the night tales and the dry spells
All the wrong ones and the right things to stay away from
And how we took off and how we on top
And how we won’t fall, how we going up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic but we called that shit the basement
Bass used to break all my momma’s vases
Unc shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn’t eight then
Always had the gas like I broke wind
They said my way of making dollars never made sense
Come take a dive, a waterfall in the deep end
I can tell you ‘bout the nights out in Fort Bend

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I can tell baby, I can tell

No you don’t tell

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, I can tell ‘bout the night tales
And all the dry wells, and all the long roads
And all my ideas before the cornrows
How we came up and how we came down
Going donuts, coffee couldn’t help now
How we zoned out, made it out the wood now
And what it do when they wanna be your friend now
How to get it, how to live and get it in now
How to go from scrappin' pockets, making his demands now
I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble ‘bout it
Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle
Five-o-four hot boys, minus the bad rap like Silkk the Shocker
But I'ma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk
Nigga you know I been a rocker, dripping milk and knockers
Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher
I top a, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about you
I’ll bumbaclot you, bumba bumba blocka shot you
Bling and bang, a bang a rapper
Bangarang, I brought my money back
Orangutan diamonds hangin' on my neng-a-lang
Bitches hanging on my dang-a-lang

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I can tell baby, I can tell

You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales

All of them bitches can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell

[Verse 1]
Gon' grab that fifth, grab that eighth
Got what you need, blow that dope, don't get too high
From the Third Coast to the West Coast, come take this ride
Let me tell the tale of how Jacques turned Scott
Over one lost trip to the sky
Let me tell the tale cause you told the tale
When you said I could make it this high
Who knew? God dammit who knew?
The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue
You can really identify when you lookin' in your eyes
You ready to ride, that's true
When they look in my eyes, they see that real
How Scotty entired that juice
Had my back against that wall
Every summer felt so cold
My daddy ain't comin' home 'til fall
That's why my pimp game so moist
Had that du-rag and all
Had a 20 year old bitch in high school
Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do
On the south side of that H-O-U
Hol' up, let's take it back to that room
No car but still had drive
Just a hundred niggas standin' outside
Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot
I'ma ride for all of my niggas

It was just 8 niggas in a two bedroom
No legroom, that was last June, yeah yeah

Never sit around, just workin', it was worth it
That's for certain, I deserve it
Lord knows we don't get tired, did more dirt than a derby
Momma worked for AT&T and we still ain't get that service
She stayed in/out the hospital, you know that made me nervous
Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent
If a bitch don't want me, don't need them still got my Jergens
And bitch you can keep them herpes, go alert me

100 G's, I got her on smash
She let it go fast
Don't know what to do with all this cash, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, Green & Purple, got me going in circles
Yeah, it's after curfew, she done snuck the work through (straight up!)
Yeah, it's controversial, how we make the world move
Yeah, you said I heard you, don't think I overheard you
Don't think I overheard
Don't think I overheard

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah
Bad line me, yeah, remain lowkey
Yeah, fuck on me, yeah, silently
Yeah, Jacques don't eat, no, Jacques don't speak
Yeah, ride lonely, yeah, driving with no keys
I can go do ‘bout a hundred of these
All my fruits bloody like Applebees
Cannot be tamed, yeah,  I had to go
Call me up Semi right up the road
I been up leanin' for nine days
I ain't been sleepin' like five days
Night in the shuttle, we're cold as hell
You want us to win, I can never tell
In the inside, I dropped this
Look at the sky for ideas
Astroworld time, it's timeless
In the back of my mind, it's reminds us
They don't want time, I'm beastin'
Hit him with time for like me
Off the lean hooked up to IV
Yeah, open up the doors, ho, let 'em swang
Link up like the rose gold on the chain
Yeah, Hpnotiq and tonic off of everything
Circles 'round your bitch, circles 'round your gang
Yeah, kick it like Cobain

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, Green & Purple, got me going in circles
Yeah, it's after curfew, she just left the work, hmm
Yeah, it's controversial, how we make the world move
Yeah, you said I heard you, don't think I overheard you
Don't think I overheard
Don't think I overheard

[Verse 3: Playboi Carti]
How you pull up on that bitch
We get the guap and we kick it
Shawty gon' suck like a tick
Diamond they look like it's dancin'
I pour the lean in the Mist
I cannot handle no shit
Shawty just handle this shit
I pop the perc and I kick
We get the guap and we kick it
I get the guap and I split (split)
Split the whole thing with my clique
VVS diamond on my wrist
My diamond not Tiffany bitch
Under no light and it hit
All of these bitches we hit
Fuckin' that bitch
Shawty bitch look like a bitch
Hittin' that shit
Forty clip came wit' the stick
Yeah, rockin' the shows
Got em like whoa
Fuckin' these hoes
Dodgin' them hoes
Keepin' the pole
Got her on go
You know how it go
Got her on road
In love with my roll
Count up bankroll
Ain't lovin' them hoes
That's when I roll

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, Green & Purple, got me going in circles
Yeah, it's after curfew, she just left the work, hm
Yeah, it's controversial, how we make the world move

Don't think I overheard
Don't think I overheard

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Big body hoggin' up the lanes
Whip so big it's like a plane
Tattoos on my body and my face
You know a young nigga can't be tamed
You don't want no problems this-a way (Oh my god)
I got blue and red flags in my gang
They say "where you get them boogers in your fangs?" (lit)
You know I had to hit up Johnny Dang (Bling, bling bow)
Ya, ya, I need that ice ahí
I need that ice ahí
Give me just what I need
Ya, all them gon' ride for me
Go and bend down for me
Never gon' cop a plea

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Know some young niggas like to swang

Pass me one while I'm grippin' 'grain
Don't hit the window don't hit the brakes
Know some young niggas like to swang

We young niggas you can't hang (oh no)
You know my young niggas can't be tamed

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Young niggas, young niggas ready to go

If I say I got it then you know I got it, yuh

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Bands, bands, bands, can't fit in my pocket (alright)
Take off with me now, take off on my rocket (It's lit)
Smash everything in Aces now we off to Follies
Now we on our own drivin' with suspension
Woods, woods, woods, that's that repetition
Pimpin', Johnny Gill that's that new edition
La Flame Don Juan young nigga pimpin'
All you can handle
I rock that bitch off the handles
She bust it open like sandals
Mess with the flannels
Diamonds go hard with the flannels
Don't need to control her (It's lit)
I change my bitch like a channel
Young niggas inside and I got young niggas
Young niggas with me (Straight up)

[Hook: Travis Scott]

Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
I know some young niggas from the bottom
They'll do anything for a dollar
I coulda went to school to be a doctor
But I dropped out and chose to be a baller
Switchin' lanes, spittin' game in my new drop
Still on a paper chase that don't never stop
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock
Party at the mansion, we bout to flood the spot
Sremmlife!

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Know some young niggas like to swang

Big bank take a little bank

Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster
You riding up uptown
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
At the green light I'm speeding
Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving
I got red eyes and swag seizures
All my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank
And a little more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top
Fuck around, make the Latinas pop
It's a new world order
Never had my head on my shoulders
Beware of the monsters
Ain't that what your preacher told ya?
La Flame, 500 degrees
From the uptown to the Magnolia

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
One hand on the wheel, ehh

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Damn you gorgeous, tell me something I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low
Got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn you conscious
Gon' get your head off the plate though
Let me show you lil Yamamoto
Take a little lick of the mayo
Out on 135th, spending them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked
Cause we got a little bit of Tango
Real nigga from the South to the East they feel a nigga
Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait
Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga
She can ride the dick no hands

[Hook]
While I'm riding uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
It's that young Fergenstein (Little Frankenstein!)
Pockets full of Benji Franklins, teacher, stay in line
Cannot take a break, in time, I'll take ya shine
Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine
I'm a lady, your bitch look like Shanaynay
Martin 'Giela so cold feel like Tommy gettin' his payday
Going nuts like a Payday, bitches thinking I'm crazy
My fraternity is the burna heat, I’m a Kappa nigga with an AK-ay
Barking loud like Q-Dogs, moving niggas like U-Hauls
Pussy niggas so RuPaul, you pussies get me tight like blue balls

[Outro]
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm riding up uptown



[Hook: Travis Scott and James Fauntleroy]
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says the smell's too loud
Riding in my old school thang
Shotgun with my old school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey
No matter what time the skies are grey
The sky is grey

[Verse 1]
Around this time, was starving, no Ramadan
Mighta robbed you blind
You, you, you, your dad and moms
Yeah, keep that in mind
Fear two things: being broke and dying
Jump your ass inside, LSD come take this ride
No A-C-I-D, how you get your ass inside
Good, take one peek at me, you might get lost in my mind
Yea, fuck that college shit, that scholarship, let's hypnotize
Yeah, ooh

[Hook]
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says the smell's too loud
Riding in my old school thang
Shotgun with my old school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey
No matter what time the skies are grey
The sky is grey

[Verse 2]
Might be the last time I trip
I know I said this shit last time
But damn I never had a trip like this
Who knew a threeway on freeway can trip with three hoes to a sixway?
Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that bengay
No more, goddamn
And pops never gave me shit
But pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where it looked so good outside like it ain't that serious
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killa tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous
The nigga so good, he was so cold
Another lost kid, Mo City soul

[Outro]
The sky is grey

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q & Travis Scott]
Bottom bitch say ho!

Rollie on bling bling, neck on ice
Tell a bitch get right, make a nigga miss that flight
Can a nigga hit that twice
Should have never let us niggas in
Got my first M 2012
Now a hundred K in the mail
Free another homie on bail
Money low her pussy gon' sell
Tryna tell me money ain't shit
When you tried to tell me water won't whip
When you tried to say this quarter won't flip
Since Snoop who the other rich crip
How Groovy get the Pringle man chip
Walk on with a twenty yard clip
Walk on while a real nigga limp
Black nigga green grass no golf
So on turn the satellite off from the set
Feel like I died on that cross hang on

[Hook: Travis Scott & ScHoolboy Q]
Ok, ok, ok
Already know it's gon' be alright
Way we going up we might be all night

[Chorus]
People tryna say I'm only into me
Got a code with my dawgs, can't get in between
I can't give them life, no more energy
Man, man, a man

[Verse]
Spent 'bout sixty on the time, I can't even lie
No way in, no way out, this shit do or die
So I roll, when I roll, must be suicide
A man, man, man (yeah!)
I can't rock Benz, I don't do peace (yeah!)
I'll beast, I'll beast, I gotta eat (it's lit!)
Sabertooth tiger, diamond two-teeth (straight up!)
Rocking right now, won't you come peek (alright!)
P was outside, P was outside (P!)
The way that ass shake, leave your mouth wide
You need to say grace 'fore you say thanks (yeah!)
A man, man, man (yeah!)
What's left in my life? Don't know what's in store
I've been dealing with these blessings that I can't ignore (can't ignore!)
Putting up the numbers, we ain't keeping score
Man, man, a man
I get on the block, wit' it in my sock
Running in the house 'fore it's twelve o'clock (yeah!)
Yeah, the hood love me but you gotta watch
Man, man, a man (yeah!)
I just popped three, I don't do sleep, yeah
Tryna shoot a scene, make a movie (straight up!)
We 'gone fall thru, coming thru deep (it's lit!)
Man, man, a man (yeah!)
Packed up from the South, moved into the West
Iced out logo on the cross, threw it on my neck, yeah
When I rep the set, gotta stay blessed, yeah
Man, man, a man

[Chorus]
People tryna say I'm only into me
Gotta code with my dawgs, can't get in between
I can't give them life, no more energy
Man, man, a man

[Outro]
Man, fuck what it meant to me
Everybody tryna take that identity
Everybody around me turned to a fr-enemy
Sit back while I sip on the remedy
I cannot let it get into me
It's playing a toll on me, mentally



[Intro: Travis Scott]
Wasted or nah?
Are you wasted or nah?
Wasted or nah?
Wasted or nah?

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Take a sip, drowning in this shit
Coppers on my hip, I hold my head
I've been taking risks to make that money flip
Yeah, I stood in it
I ain't ordering, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accounts
20 racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit-it
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like "One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man"
One skinny tatted nigga, blunt flicker
Young La Flame hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yeah

[Hook: Pimp C]
It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end

[Interlude: Juicy J & Travis Scott]
There's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor
Can't handle these drugs
Wasted or nah?
It's only real niggas that can handle their shit man
Wasted or nah? Yeah
Wasted or nah?
So if you tryna get lit, wanna pour up
Make sure you stay on our level cause we go up
Let me see you up

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Is you wasted baby?
One shot, two shots and you still talking crazy
Three shots and you faded
Freaks coming out at night and they gettin' X rated
Four shots now she wanna do the clique
Any more shots she ain't gon' remember shit
Smoking on extendos, no clips
Project hoes going up in the Ritz
She gon' do it for a G, anything for me bro
She just wanna fucking drink and chief all the weed up
Sexy bitch, pop that pussy cause you in your prime
Pour that purple over ice, call it turtle time
Shawty never been a hesitator
Got her going down on the elevator
Hear that pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her
Fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later
No magic trick but I levitate her
With the magic stick, nothing less than great
When I hit her with the dope D I'm gone
Don't text me later, no extra favors

[Hook: Pimp C]
It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end

[Outro: T.I.]
Mm; weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say
All the products of a young man gone the long way
From the home that he knew, 'til he roamed where he at
And the phone break up, unknown wake up
Several one night stands, hung up phone, break up
If he fall, will he fly? Sure wouldn't take much
For you to find out, jump, if you took that plunge
If not, we're in the same spot, how could you judge?
How could you judge? Could you judge?

She frozed up, I unfrozed her, now come a little closer (straight up)
Get your ass up off that wall and go roll up that doja (that dough)
Tell your boyfriend bust that key, go 'head and fill ya nose up (La Flame)
Till it's over, we ain't lookin' for the hoes where the trophies
Grab a glass go ahead get throwed up (straight up)

Out in Houston they know my name (ooo)
In MO city they know the gang (ooo)
Young La Flame ain't nothin' changed
But the chains and diamond rings
Diamond rings, I lost my brains
Me and Ye Ye, out in broad day
I'm on the 3rd coast
Eatin' Burlow with Merlot (straight up)
I got my shirt off
Kickin' dirt off
Out in Bergdorf (La Flame)
She like what you doin'?
It took a path just to get me here
Don't give a damn if that's ruined
Later on got a "ring, ring, ring"
She at my doorbell "ding, ding, ding, ding"
Let the bitch in the bitch seen bang out bang out
On the couch, on the floor, in her mouth
Camera's out
Once my dick's in, no pulling out

[Bridge]

Bitch been doing coke since the 80's (that dough)

Last call for you to slip out them drawers
Girl, I need it right now, get your ass in this stall
We ain't got time to stall
These niggas got me pissed off
Sippin' so long, girl, I'm pissin' Cristal
Sippin' and swervin'
My words don't know if I crashed into a pool or her jaw
Pops never home, left a long term
On the back when a lil' nigga had to sit and deal with it
Loner turned rock star, nigga, under the moon
Got the world in my palm, 'bout to rub her pussy with it
When you dominate it, come with digits
Let her see the Tempur-Pedic
Bend it over, beat it, skeet it
Then delete it, then repeat it
Then repeat it (yeah) then she told me...

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Fuck that other side, nigga, fuck that other side
We don't play that shit
Yeah, grab your girl, tell your bitch, "Just quit playin'"
Later we gon' play that shit
It's all good, it's alright
Plenty bitches down to ride
Yeah, and if it all goes down

[Bridge: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Nothin' but net
Not-not-nothin' but net (swoosh, ballin')
Nothin' but net
Nothin' but net



[Verse]
She take a shot of Hennessy
I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this shit for him and me
I'm the next lone star to blow-up
Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The rav four turned into a Rover
Til' it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat all day, itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it

[Hook]
No no no no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off
Falling off, never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off
(oohh ohh oohh) Right
(oohh ohh oohh) Right
(oohh ohh oohhh)

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
I'm that Ferragamo Hussein, Tom Cruisin', Rock Of Ages
Semi-god estate, gettin' cake, could've thought I'm Jewish
Fuck, fuck, fuck, might lose your soul for my language
Nowadays's, niggas been at round tables talking all that heinous language
Plutonica, insomnia
Put that money on your head, Balenciaga yarmulke
Fifteen when I carried loads of them Ozium's
And them bag of nicks, I mean groceries
I mean daddy knows ain't no controlling me
My bad, look Scotty might sag
She give me head before the ass and never let no nigga smash
No puffing, no pass

Get everything that you got
Break me a piece of that off, rest in peace niggas I lost

[Hook]

Oh God, this shit too cold for the mink, Ye
Bang, bang, bang, my niggas ain't tamed
Might buried your ass in that Sphinx, mane
Sip Merlot, watch us make the champagne rain
Let my ding-a-lang hang, I'm a south side nigga where the 'caine reign
We running, summers, we running
Spring and fall, jogging be nothing
Winter, they cuffing, cuffing them up as they loving
The same month as my niggas stuffing
Riding through, rockin', Shaka Zulu
Block Crip or whole family blue; bloody, yeah, su-woo
Ain't you supposed to preach what you practice?
Put a rubber on if you stabbing
Get baptized if you baptist but ain't it evil to live backwards
Holy Ghost, hold on
Chakalu blakalu los: that's tongue for you niggas who lost

[Hook]
I got diamonds on my blocka, serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that’s my flocka... to my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper

Niggas rollin' like rollers, might roll up in dun-ta-duns (straight up)
Don't think that I've had enough (La Flame!)
Cause I been on the binge
Scored a coke model, that's a high fashion win
Splurgin' in the mall got me spendin' all my ends

The devil inside me and I'm tryin' to hide it
This lean got me nauseous, but I keep on usin' it

I went and tried to sit down with the Pope
And tell him I was usin' too much dope
The only way I tell him anything, he gotta plug me in with the coke

[Intro]
Our first kiss in the livin' room
That's a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
We did drugs in the bedroom
That's a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
But she caught me fuckin' in the bathroom
Rubbers all over the bathroom
That's a hella way to end the night
Tonight (Tonight)

[Bridge 1]
I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth
Thought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead

[Verse]
It's a hell of a night for Heaven's sakes
All you see is mountain and clouds, can't hit the brakes
She hit me twice in the face, there goes the base
She like to lift her nylon skirt to show the lace
She say she love me but don't know what love is
I lost love cause my daddy said it but ain't ever done shit
Pain is love and love is hell
I might need some bail if this shit don't sell
Hand on my dick while I'm coastin' up the Fiji
Slow motionin' through emotion just in case a nigga see me
They'll come and feed you but that felt a little easy
I brought the squeegee case it get a little greasy
After a moment I fell into the mist
She reminisce a nigga style, God damn a nigga rich
Wine and cigarettes under a light
Said she lost that angel done turned into a hell of a night

[Bridge 1]
I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth
Thought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead

[Hook: Travi$ Scott and James Fauntleroy]
Oh, it's a hell of a night
It's a hell of a night



[Part 1: Bad Mood]

[Verse 1]
(I just have one question)
Fuck outta my business
I did things that most men will ask forgiveness
Broke the code, the commandments from my descendants
Who gives a fuck? New children in the buildin'
We ride with no limits
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?
I'm in a bad mood

[Verse 2]
Rob that dude, fuck that couch, burn that house
We the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror
A thousand on the leather, you niggas should know better
We niggas new slaves, I do say (Fuck, fuck)
Twice only on a Tuesday when I'm in a bad mood
Oooh, your skin mahogany
Oooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze
Had me trickin' 40k for some grades
Just to make 40k for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day
I'm in a bad mood

[Verse 3]
Oooh nigga I'm wildin' on 'em, back pilin' on 'em
I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain
So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah
Kid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal
Jumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho
They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty
Anxiety, after the meds, Kris Bobbi

[Verse 4]
Skinny black bastard ridin' a Casper
I tend to lose my thoughts when I walk
They say I'm a slave so tell me the master
Now his head on the pendant by the cross
Coke'd it then I fucked her for the theory
You know I'm crazy, I'm straight, no weary
I hate when conversates can't relate
You know it be fucking up my groove when I'm in a bad mood

[Part 2: Shit On You]

[Bridge]
I can't wait... I can't wait... just to shit on you...

[Verse 5]
This one for the fuck fake niggas
That love to just hate, dog
Always talkin' that wild shit
See 'em never let them verbs off
All these fuckin' missed calls
Might delete the whole call log
Thousand dollars for the jeans, fam
She grip 'em when a nigga swerve off
Think I need a desert eagle, niggas in my face
Thinking they know Jacques, niggas don't know me
Grew up on my lonestar, niggas roll that weed

[Hook]
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
Just to shit on you
I can't wait, just to shit on you

(But why, Travis?)

[Hook]
Yeah
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
Just to shit on you
I can't wait, just to shit on you

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin'
Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your bitch just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'
In fact that nigga prolly missin'

Speedin', and damn I'm leanin' on a Kawasaki
In the lobby, then we 'dro codeinin', out in Abu Dhabi
Chain beamin', man, I hope you ain't anemic
Cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, it's just me and four women
And we all playin' hockey
Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane
Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass
Fuck up the flow, nothin' but fam cause niggas be hoes
You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ
When I stock it up and then rack it up and then go
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs
My nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho house
Spillin' booze where the Barbie at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga
Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at?
If Scottie ain't totin' or swimmin' in women
He writin', producin' and scorin' and filmin'

On that lean and soda, I'm not no alcoholic
How does that feel, my nigga? I said it feel great
Come bust a trip and come and be my tourist (straight up!)
Alligator swamp, we pill pop in my hood
Ain't no changin' that, cut that check we all good (straight up!)
9 A.M. clockin', 4 A.M. water whippin'
Just got to the Mo, my niggas still leanin', tippin'
Had to bust a bitch I knew back from my old days
Shawty held me down when a nigga had that bald fade (straight up!)
504, my nigga, shout my woadie
La Flame killin' you, niggas, damn I'm sorry
That's not my kid, call up my nigga, Maury
Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom and I'm stickin' to that story
I bust a nut like I bust a brick
Bust a band like I bust a bitch
Bust a nigga like I bust a bitch
But I pass it like I'm Robert Horry

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!)



[Intro: Yung Mazi]

You know, bitch said I had a baby on the way, I told her we gon' see on Labor Day. I ain't gonna drop a bitch off until she stay on the spray away. Ayy, when these hoes gonna pull up for all of us? Yeah you get what I'm saying, you wanna marry 'em, you gotta marry my niggas, fuck you mean? Tell that bitch I said shut the fuck up, sit down, and pour up

[Hook]
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and fuck my homies
It's quite enormous, my dinosaurus
You're my tourist, come be my tourist
I bought vatore, bought my wrist some more wrist
12 at the door, flush it down the toilet
With dem boys, whippin' it enormous
My dick enormous

[Verse 1]
Fightin' the mood
Breakin' the rules, howl at the moon
Yellin' my blues, wanna hit snooze
Chase it with booze
I'm out in the noon, she out in the nude
Fightin' the fumes, it's hotter than June
I'm under the moon
Followin' you
I'm out of my head, I'm out on the road
It's nowhere to go, I gave you my soul
Am I right, am I wrong?
Tryna get home
The love, I'm up in the hill
My high's as low as a hill
High's as low as a hill

[Hook]
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and fuck my homies

12 at the door, flush it down the toilet
With dem boys, whippin' it enormous
My dick enormous

[Verse 2]
I'm in them ovaries, I'm in them ovaries

Fallin' on some diamond bourse and now we all rich
Hidin' [?], hide in that [?], I just [?]
Now it's a party, yeah it's a garden, let's get it started
I forgot it, she pass the Marley, tweak off a molly
Pop a Xanna and tie the red up
Don't hold a petty hoe for ransom
Goddamn for answer, pop on a lancer

[Hook]
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and fuck my homies

Long distance I might use up all my minutes

So pop a livin, I'm just tryna feed the children
Feed all my sisters nigga, forget' all my bitches
And I, [?] in it

I need some niggas who be down when I ain't busy
Hard work, hard work and dedication

[Intro: Theophilus London]
Where the weather is warm

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn’t working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can’t wait
In the moonlight you can’t see my eyes
And when I’m off the things I can’t think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can’t choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, cause the bills they was over due
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed in the cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don’t wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I’m on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just go'n cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can’t be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it can’t fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
I’m headed to the moon cause the west screwed up
Like the city I grew up so
I’m pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D I'm full when I’m on E, you don’t know nothing 'bout me
Back wood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain’t no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and I’m doing my dance

[Hook-Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

Running red lights, you scurred?
Might fuck around and just swerve
(Wait, shut the fuck up), hallelujah
Bow down when I walk in this bitch
Ho remember that
That was just a modeling chick
9 bitches now wanna go
And tell their bitch screaming how they knew ya
Fucking with the double x why'd you do it
Leave you hanging watch your momma mop the fluid
Now your casket close, screaming how they knew ya'

Walk on water falls, they got back for raps and back to seal
World full of rage niggas who gon' stop that now
Price on that pussy is up to bring them panties down

Drinkin', sippin', slow (slow it down baby)
Lean so cold now, froze, froze, froze
Come on over, get drunk

Slide down, nigga, how it is
I've been dependent, biz up in the Bentley
Got a hundred bitches on the private
Another private lit, and all them fightin' in it (what!)

Baby do not fast, go slow, wait (trust issues)
Tell me, tell me information, I got rank (tell me)

Never ever, do I wanna leave my little lady

Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise)
Every time I try to stick it in all the way
Baby girl be like "ay ay, ay ay"

Thousand dollars on me, I've been going all week
Diamonds, all my drugs, nigga, I can't get no sleep
I just want some love, I've been going way too deep
Falling on my mouth, bank can't give me no more weight
Top play, aye they haters, young nigga tryna say shit
Big dog conversation, big ice revelation
Rolex rollin' on my piece, I been going fine on all week
Yeah, designer on my feet

Every time, even family time, It take no place, yeah

Smokin' big, drankin' syrup, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

(Cassette rewinding)

[Sample from Lil Flip's "I Can Do Dat"]
What, sucker free, what, what

I can do dat, ay

If I spill drank on my clothes - I can do dat

I'ma spend about fifty in the mall - I can do dat
I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall - I can do dat
I'ma stop weak niggas from rappin'...

(Cassette rewinding)

[Sample from Z-Ro's "I Can't Leave Drank Alone"]
I, can't, leave, drank alone
It got me feenin' (Feenin', feelin' good, Feelin' like a boss as I'm creeping through my hood)

(Car driving and speeding; tires screeching)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn a brother stay tested and the devil wear Prada
(Just trynna go up the avenue)

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
We rockin' furs, look like I copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on the steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep that my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that's the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours, I just stared at the stars
And looked with my eyes closed cause its driving me wild

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Oh yeah

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Outro]
Dad: Junior!
Travi$: Fuck...
Dad: Junior, turn that shit off!
Travi$: Man, for what, nigga shutup
Dad: What'd I tell you about playing' that loud ass music in this fuckin' house?!?
Travi$: Fuck! Fuckin' drums crazy...



[Hook]
I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
(Dance like a 90s baby)
Nanana Nanana Nanana Na na
Feel like I'm floating through traffic
(Then it "poof" like magic)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This shit be the coldest
Wake up nigga, smell the Folgers
Fuck she throwing up last night
Only if the dumb bitch did what I told her
She feel me, I feel her
And she even the let me move my fingers up her skirt
Fuck it live for the moment
Had no bread, now the hoes spread like toast is
Her legs spread like Moses
On my way, raise your glass we can have a toast
To the same ones that love talking that wild shit
Be the same ones who wanna be around the most
Tony said soon enough niggas will have a two-tone
Two blond chicks with the roof gone
Complaining now that her breasts out
Well at least you could've thought to put the mink on

[Hook]
I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
Nanana Nanana Nanana Na na
Feel like I'm floating through traffic
(Then it "poof" like magic)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wet dreams with the prom queen
Now I'm tryna screw me a centerfold
Every nigga have their wild dreams
Mines is to fly to the summer in my winter clothes
Sin city is a mile away
I see the devil in a skirt, but it's a nightgown
Hallelujah, does it even matter if it's night or day
When we pull up, she gon' pull her shirt down
This where we find em'
Same niggas that sniff Donna
And get drunk of the Mimosa
Space green or designer
Hermes based off of drama
Call it spendin' yoda
Six years catch me trying yoga
In the Caesar Palace rocking a toga
Throwing a toga party
Chilling with your bitch and she extra naughty

[Hook]
I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
Nanana Nanana Nanana Na na
Feel like I'm floating through traffic
I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
Nanana Nanana Nanana Na na
Feel like I'm floating through traffic
(Then it "poof" like magic)



[Justin Vernon]
I just wanna spread my wings
Life ain’t what it seems
Someone in this cruel world
Escaping through the night
Look into my night, my thoughts
Naked in this cruel world

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Tears dripping on my pillow thoughts is in my head
See my dreams jump out my window if I follow I'll be dead
And I been waiting all week to talk this shit but instead
Gon' have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand
And what we fucking for? For the lights in the night
The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
You can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga
I mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink
And she don't want to dance 'less she drink
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?
Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links
Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E
Wonder why I see the stars in the afternoon
Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moon

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Wake up in the morning, throwin' on them Nikes
Runnin' through that check, shout my nigga Phil Knight
Oreos in Oregon State, pop twenty pills in the night
Goin' a thousand miles in another state
They ain't oreos but they bright
Clap it break that back, she just made a stack
Niggas in that trap still totin' them straps
If you make it where I'm from, It's like a lone star in the sky that's all black
A "ménage à trois" with black dykes, damn
That's the new civil rights
Accidentally walked in the club, all these bitches bite
Told my mama fuck a major, best decision of my life
Now niggas in the corridor, I'm velvet down to my corduroys
Got bottles by the cases, pussy by different races

[Hook]
I had to get her right
That pussy changed my life (straight up)

Purp in my itch palms, red lips six inches long
Took her like a hooker now come get your Shaun

Feed her to the mountain lions, cause that bitch try countin' mine
Pussy, nigga yous a pussy nigga just a pussy nigga
You be doushin' I be pushin' ether
Bitch, you fuck boy cunt
Won't be satisfied until I see ya'll sufferin' in the sun
Chiefin' while I'm beefin' turn me odds to evens
My lawyers are some heathens beat it
Blowin' on some on reefers
If you didn't want a war, then why you'd wage it then?
I only wear jeans, I could fit a gage up in

Amazing, junkie jit came up major in
Trench team, ten deep, red beam, laser tag
Bring it, what you got police and pistols don't phase your man

Suicide doors pull up when we ride by
Goon niggas hop up with guns fuck a drive by
Smokin' weed on the jet, bitch I'm fly high
You don't wanna give me neck? Bitch, bye bye
On to the next bitch, I hope she bi bi
Cause I love bitches that love bitches that love bitches
Fuckin' on they friends and I love fuckin' on they sisters
Bad bitches roll my swishers, God damn I'm that nigga
Smokin' on that reefer thinkin' how can I get richer
Damn shawty bad like the old Detroit Pistons
Damn I wanna fuck when I hit I'm gettin' misses
Treat her like shit man its fuck-a-bitch feelings
Money stacked tall man it's touchin' my ceiling

Never fuck with the black and blue

Shocked what a nigga might do
Young nigga blessed like a nigga AH-CHOO (bless up)
In the Mo they smokin' raw diesel
Evil Knievel whip pullin' off in the dust (skurrt! skurrt!)
Throwin' flame rocks when a bitch might jerk (straight up)
Bouncin' this bitch like it's tennis
Vitches still eatin' at Denny's
Hotels phones I'm talkin' that business

Besides nigga, your niggas facade, nigga

[Hook: Gunplay]

[Intro]
What we gon' do with that boy?

[Verse]
Fuck I lost my mind
I've been runnin' since a quarter eight on the dirt road straight out The Mo'
Flip the bird 'fore a nigga faint
Fuck moms think a nigga strung on dope, niggas thinkin' I can't
Shit you wanna know me?
Let me show your ass a little thing
Every time I walk in this bitch, fresh feeling my for finna fish
She want to hold a nigga dick for the piss
To the squat for the flick
Give me yo thoughts for a bit
Right, gon' hit the weed, gon' head just cough little bit
Cum in her mouth but couple kids lost, coulda been a good spouse

[Outro]
Mom: Wake the fuck up baby Jacques!
Travis: Fuck, I was dreamin'!
Dad: Junior, get the fuck up!
Travis: Fuck, I cummed on my boxers, fuck!
Dad: Get yo ass up boy!
Travis: Fuck they want? Fuck!
Mom: Baby Jacques, wake the fuck up! Get yo ass downstairs!
Travis: Shut up, bitch, fuck!
Dad: Junior! Junior! Junior! What the hell!?
Travis: I gotta get the fuck out of here, fuck this...



[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rockstars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind

[Hook]
But the nights keep fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Summer time was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

[Hook]
But the nights keep fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey

[Hook]
But the nights keep fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey

No love for 'em

She wants to fuck
She need it
No love, no fucks



[Verse 1]
My momma always ask me 'bout attitude
Damn, momma I don't know at all
I met this chick who want to meet me at the avenue
I had a feeling we'd have a ball
She knows stars, I know that
She want cars, I want jets
She want to get eloped, but I don't know yet
Pick up my fur after sitting, hanging in the coat check
Give me calls, she pick me off, I didn't hit the door yet
Damn, I'm sorry, but that bitch gon' be looking love sick
All on TV, crying to Maury, looking love sick
While I'm probably in the Rari, going Audi, fucking with molly
And we running on E, not the gas, but the molly
And she fucking with me so she came to have a party
Now she leaving with me, now you're love sick

[Hook: Daron Eubanks]
Do you realize?
We all want these flashing light, oh
So when you close your eyes
Do you picture us havin' a hell of a night? Oh

[Verse 2]
Dinner time, I'm dining out with a porn star
She remind me of home, L.A., our second home
See see we met at Leon, plenty empty bottles of Lonestar
Conversation was long, how she landed from Rome
Yeah, she did
Later on that night I got her back to the crib
Kicked off My Will&Rich and got her down to her skin
After all she got a little taste test of my kids
You know what, we used to dream about this
A couple models and cribs, way fresher than movies
Should of know it was fake, I could tell by the boobies
Treated life like a safe, load it up and then blew me
Yeah, she did
Head so good, it ain't even cost me
Woke up, she gone, look what I lost
Sheepskin' and that (?)

[Hook]
Do you realize?
We all want these flashing light, oh
So when you close your eyes
Do you picture us havin' a hell of a night? Oh

Up in the ghost she said she need it the most
Quit tripping we having a toast
Step in and out the plane

All on the boat showing her boobies the most
Lets toss her and see if she float

She had a couple thoughts
Told her I ain't trusting that

Yeah, go ahead spend it, I’m live in it

Yeah, when it come to I she turn so independent, yeah
When it comes to this D she turn so damn dependent (straight up)
Night times from a time cold
You really wanna say yes but you sayin' no
I won't stop by my gang like I can't goI let her drug the ring then she Rick the Rose
Yeah, ice ice biting Cartier Bangles
Yeah, she let me smash her friends 'long as the chain froze
Yeah, ain't been here 15 minutes why she changed clothes
She right with me through the city while we slayin' dough (Straight up)
Slide through the hood pop up on the north (yeah, yeah)
You know everything go when you reach the show



[Verse 1]
Wake me up in the morning
Versace out with this gold on
We roll around in 'em ponies
205 in your hometown, and you know this
Big medallions I keep it stylish you ain't notice
Put you down on my Brodus
This that Paris flow,
100 digits no area codes
Hanging out in them white streets
All black where the hipsters go
Everybody here choking
Serious rap, your serious raps: too focused
Stressin' out while we coolin' out

[Hook]
Big buds, brussel sprouts
Big boobs, let 'em out
Chillin' homie my chain heavy
Might as well let your dogs out
Rottweilers, Great Danes
Smart bitch, dumb brain
Flip the bird, hit the swerve
Somehow niggas done missed the curve

[Verse 2]
Boss shit, too fresh to go floss it
Too cold for Jack Frost, bitch
Throw one up in that mosh pit
Tony got this bitch choking
Fifty two in that Hoover Benz, and we lurkin'
Suicide, and they pokin'
This that dentist flow, organic Arsenio
Chillin' out in them white streets
All black where the hipsters go
Everybody in here floatin'
Serious Wapanese, all them Japanese holdin'

[Hook 2]
Big buds, brussel sprouts
Big boobs, let 'em out
Four chains, let 'em hang
Golden egg in my pinky ring
Might as well let them dogs out
Rottweilers, Great Danes
Smart bitch, dumb brain
Flip the bird, hit the swerve
Somehow niggas done missed the curve



[Intro: French Montana]
Montana, Breezy, you know what it is when you hear that haa

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Don't you open up that window
Chrome .45 with that extendo
Off that batch of molly, pussy, all we know
In that Lamborghini, how fast does your 'rari go?
All my niggas trippin', you might catch a body flow
She pussy poppin', I'ma tip her, that's the way I roll
Told me thots are crazy, told her I've been here before
Her man came home and now I'm creepin' out that window
I ain't with playin' games or sneakin', she just wanna twerk it on a weekend
I'm fuckin' with a bad Puerto Rican, pussy so wet, my dick a ten like the deep end
We in Las Vegas so you know we never sleepin'
100 bottles and you know I snuck my weed in

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Montana, haaa
Go to LIV on Sunday
Wake up and go to court on Monday
I just met an actress this week
She came through the crib with six freaks
I've been trappin' since fifteen
Talkin' back when bricks was fifteen
Don't you open up that window
I don't chase bitches, I just pimp hoes
Talkin' 'bout that brown bag is all we know
Hollywood bitches always wanna smoke
I just made 3 mil this week
In the streets, Montana hotter than fish grease
All the bitches in my face, paparazzis takin' pictures
That's that Californiacation, I just need my medication
Talkin' reggie for the patiences, sippin' yellow, purple, Lakers
Got green and blue faces, talkin' crib, 50 acres, ooh
Call up your bitches, come fuck with the squad
All of my niggas, we roll like the mob
Tell 'em broke niggas don't get on ya job
Bitch wanna pillow talk, working a job
Hit up Miami, woke up in Atlanta
Hop out the Porshe and I jump the Phantom
Hop off your bitch and I pose for the camera
You niggas can't stand us
She up and let us through that window
Clip bottles long as a Lambo
I'm talkin' brown bags is all we now
Them Hollywood bitches wanna smoke



[Hook]
I'm floating high, don't talk to me
I'm rolling high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights please

[Verse 1]
What the fuck they want?
I'm drunk as hell, fuck work today
I wanna get some tail, damn my little nigga graduated
Man I wish him well, now there's no more breaking them pies
And making that bail for them scales!
Step across that fence , and thats your life
When I run that town, That whip about town size
4 Chains, they hang on my neck, was dipped in that brown rice
You think something wrong cause your shit don't shine bright
But ain't nothing wrong because your shit don't shine bright!

[Hook]
I'm floating high, don't talk to me
I'm rolling high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights please

[Verse 2]
It was Friday, what a night what a situation
My nigga chase momma called cause he missed that graduation
He told her momma please, have a drink have a little bit patience
Cause soon we would be riding in a car with a little ventilation
Pastor said that we gotta move to congregation
I'm looking for salvation but I'm drowning in the revelations
XX revolution its a inauguration to the whole nation
If it ain't no head, no sex, then its masturbation!

[Hook]
I'm floating high, don't talk to me
I'm rolling high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights please

I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We lost in the world who's feeling safe
It's parked outside been in the case
We walk outside feel like a mason
The preacher at the altar to tell you to have a taste
White wine, go ahead and sip your race
And walk in the closet and feel amazed
Ain't no retire, fall out of line and we get to pacin
And we gonna simply reside and fill up the space and
Took the travis may leave you around and place it
That's a classic, no other way to have it
Remember me and my brother slept on that mattress
And look how many bitches piled up on that mattress
I'm feeling too proud, cause all my niggas around
I gotta prove it right now waitin' for ‘em to feel it
It was cool for a second, but now might take a minute
Cause now I'm in the building, god damn, I'm about to kill it

[Hook]
I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 2: T.I.]
3-57 apparel the shit I wearo be Balenciaga
Prada, Margiela or something hotter
Double barrel your medulla oblongata send you to Allah
A million dollars on my wardrobe, damier on my collars
Nothing short of an assassin, garments I stick my ass in
Kill niggas dead on the scene, no casket
Basking in my glory on the 37th story of a highrise
Ten hoes, nice thighs, mai tais
Serving umbrellas, but I knew the perfect fellow
So impressive, she would this Beretta if I let her
Have a blast of a lifetime, ass of a lifetime
I swear this dick I give her it'll last her a lifetime
A nice night selling hard rock in the pipeline
Put in their life and now they love a nigga longtime
Wednesday three freaks, Thursday four hoes
Five on Friday, yesterday six chicks
Today is the Sabbath I got seven going at it
On a mattress doing shit you can't imagine, I'm laughing
True story, real talk, that's classic

[Hook]
I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Had to leave from home, better off than hell
Skip the town somehow I ended up in jail
Loved the jail, it was better in the cell
Did a little crime, too that shit never ever tell
Somewhat I'm partying the third partying
First she started gargling, and end up swallowing
And went to class too and got some knowledge
You fucking with the devil like she over popping him
She love the pills too she over popping em'
She's standing in the line, just to do the line
Fuck is that fresher than a motherfucker
Tell me wanna fuck with us
Frontline hands up, niggas while we thrown dust

[Hook]
I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I, Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I

[Sample: Travi$ Scott]
Feel like I'm, feel like I'm (on the drive to the moon)

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn the devil stay testin' and the devil wear Prada (Just trynna go up an avenue)
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
Be rockin' furs, look like copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours I just stared at the stars
Look with my eyes closed cause it's driving me wild

[Bridge: Travi$ Scott]
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

[Verse 2: Matt Healy]
I hit the weed and just drive
Never fucked around so I’ll be alright
And you can sit around here fucking with smaller minds than mine, live your life
She said the air is so clean
I think it was the codeine
But she thinks it's just trees
I like it when you stroke me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
She likes to take LSD
Searching mathematical purity
Travel with security
Smokin' in the wind
Losing all my friends, smokin' in the wind
She said I'm feeling so lean, I think you called it codeine
Now her heads on their knees
I like it when you blow me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch,  don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive



Lifted, I'm feeling so gifted, tripping, I'm constantly falling
Channel view of the whole villa, plotting while burning a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whipping the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, since she's lamping with the trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line
Listen, pimping your bitches might visit my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth, I copped it but now I don't miss it
World found it, teeth probably glissing, in fact that nigga prolly missing

La Flame

Travis gets a hotdog from hotdog stand, drives off and
Gets in a car accident

Playing instrumental to "the ends"

Travis: Spoken
Dimness, my old brother
I can feel whispers flying over endless rain of meaningless chaos
Reality always exceed fiction
I can see an unborn generation
I can hear within the silence and see within the nothingness
Flashing neon lights trying to throw off and disturb my fucking judgment
Past, present, and future in a nonending circle
Hear my words of temptation and redemption
They made me believe I could escape
Remember this shit, remember me, the one who die here
It's time to live

Playing "coordinate"

Travis steps off the roof of an abandoned building to be found on the ground of an abandoned construction site

Playing "the ends"

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Tonite we'll slide to the future
Have the time of our lives
In one night, every night
For the rest of our lives
We're hovercraft fly
Lookin' down at the stars
You ain't ever been this fly before
Party like it's '94
And get twisted

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This a new world, no rules
Hop in my spaceship and let's cruise
See the whole galaxy like we on shrooms
Burnin' all the gas, might get high off the fumes
A couple more toasts of these damn mimosas
I leave her legs spread like she fuckin' Moses
I leave her back bent a lil scoliosis
Lift off, hit the perc, hope I don't swerve
Mayday, mayday
Make a lil' cheese, your pockets need to gain weight
We gon' to the stars, I took her on a play date
Where they're speakin' a language that nobody can translate
She see the Earth then froze
If you scared of heights, then baby keep them eyes closed
Feelin' like Biggie cause this money ain't a thing
Might need more champagne so niggas can make it rain

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Tonite we'll slide to the future
Have the time of our lives
In one night, every night
For the rest of our lives
We're hovercraft fly
Lookin' down at the stars
You ain't ever been this fly before
Party like it's '94
And get twisted

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Been grindin' all day so it's good for the night though
Workin' all weekend so I might blow
Don't worry 'bout it, even if the light's low
Cause I threw on the 'Giela like a light show
I need more bottles, more flames
More with my whole gang
I do it cause we do it
Buy everything that we all drink
It's strange when your niggas turn fake
A dime never weigh another weight
Models on models, they 'bout it, 'bout it
The bitches, bitches on top of my world
My world at the top of it
Bill me them niggas that's poppin'
Coppin', they scared of them trenches
Got homies with homies in Heaven
Them niggas existin'

[Hook: Roscoe Dash & Travis Scott]
Tonite we'll slide to the future
God level in my section over here
Have the time of our lives
Bitch don't look at my section over here
In one night, every night
Clap, make it rain, clap when they bring it back
For the rest of our lives
It be like stack, after 'nother stack, we get after that
We're hovercraft fly
Lookin' down at the stars
You ain't ever been this fly before
Party like it's '94
And get twisted

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We waited so long for this, to transform like I'm optimus
Monogamy for monogamous, ironically don't have time for this
The education brought scholarships
All the street taught us was to be street walkers
Full of hype and the life of a cheap talker
So tonight don't have no excuse not to take these offer
Now its time to make these suffer
Break out the bread and the wine and make E supper
Feel like a Pharaoh in his prime call that de-mumma
Momma please don't trip on these trees at least none of these fuck ya
In the mind set of the greatest
Put that I'm a young Houston legend in the making
Grab your cameras Ima photo to be taking
Let the lights down tell them pipe down

[Hook]
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So lets rule the world tonight don't worry will show off

[Verse 2]
All black blending in the night
X pound triple X style so profound alana fife
Secretary poppin molly call it X-files
Think I'm in a daze I'm just feeling Blazed
Think I'm in a shape but I'm behind a maze
Funny you was amazed when you was getting laid
Me and my niggas plotting now we getting paid
Giuseppe stilettos and arabic camaros
Everybody's fine no Robert De Niro
Why everybody do the line is my favorite hero
Guess I gotta find the time just to do the crime
She did a lot of crimes sleepy hallow time
Headhunter been up for hours doing head crunches
Stop using your head and go head and just learn something
But her head is only as strong as her bread damn it

[Hook]
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So lets rule the world tonight don't worry will show off
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So lets rule the world tonight don't worry will show off

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
It's the Vendetta
No tarot cards could tell me we trendsetters
Everybody out tonight it couldn't of been better
Ain't nobody fight tonight except for the bartenders
We threw up our mom's dinner
So tell what you trying to do?
Me and my homies got the loot so we trying to boot
Her and her breast full off the booze it's a party for two
Hotel room numbers and late night food runners
Summary of the whole summer, but can't seem to remember
From the fall of September, most of we can't remember
From the Spring to the Winter, couldn't tell you my dinner
Wish I could tell you what I did back in my past life
So how the hell you
Think I could tell you about last night?

[Hook]
Now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)
(You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like) (Last night)
Now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about...

[Intro: Kurt Russell in "Big Trouble in Little China"]
This is Jack Burton in the Porkchop Express and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin' out there
Like I told my last wife
I says: "Honey, I never drive faster than I can see, besides that, it's all in the reflexes"

[Chorus]
Off the reflex, off the reflex
Off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another xan just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset
Won't you flex that ass again
Off a reflex, off the reflex
Off the reflex
Had to pop another xan just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Off a reflex, off a reflex (yeah), off a reflex (yeah)
I've been blowing through these bands, I'm in a deep check
All these bitches in my room, I feel like Keith Sweat (oeh)
We been going too in, I think I needs rest
When you leave, I think about it, damn, I need it
Johnny Cochran on these hoes the way I beat it
You make me weak, but don't mistake it for my weakness
I've been out here, I've been out here with your deepest
Automatic, going in, I'm going T-Rex
VVS's turn the T-shirt to a V-neck (straight up)
Gon' create and spend that money we ain't seen yet
All my niggas out and they 'gone make it

[Bridge]
Off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another xan, just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset
Won't you flex that ass again
Off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Popped another xanny just to reset, just to reset

(Turn my vocal up, yeah)

[Chorus]
Off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another xan just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset
Won't you flex that ass again
Off a reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another xan just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

[Snippet]
Ride in the back of my Benz
Back of my Benz
[?] the back of my Benz
Back of my Benz (Back of my Benz)
Back of my Benz (Back of my Benz)
Roll up then ride up, get in
Roll up, get in
Pull up, get out



[Verse 1]
Ashes, dust to dust
Death all on her mind, don't let her fuck it up
Fucking with these hoes make you put it up
At least Adam and Eve got to bust a nut
High of the blow just bought another nose
And I might pull off in that Ghost like where that nigga go?
Doctor gave her double D's cause she heard a nigga flow
Whoa, she move the nigga aside cause he ain't important
She turn that
Cigarette to ash and watch it hit the dust
Girl quit playing yeah you know that nigga boring
Not to many in leather pants that can fuck with us
Now let us dance while I throw the dust
Ashes, to dust to dust
Know they all throw they hands cause they fuck with us
So many bitches bob and weave but they don't bob enough
Now these bitches mad look what I done started up
Put that whip outside, I hit the key it started up
I told them kiss my ass while I hit the dust
I hit the weed then I hit the gas
So much gold you think a nigga broke
So we gon' pull of trunk first so that you niggas know
With an Irish centerfold but all she know is Adido
Damn my momma proud a nigga made it out the moat
Where the sun always shine yeah but not no more
We party in the jungle till its time to go
So everybody rumble as they hit the floor
And if the world end it don't matter cause we bout to blow

[Hook x2]
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
Thats all I would die to see

[Verse 2]
Driving 108 don't crash and hit the rail
Don't look deep in her eyes you might see hell
32-34 not that I'm male
So many hours, after hours in hotels
What a crazy night, I ran away from home just to change my life
Remember when my niggas told them owls came out at night
So now we bout to touch the sky, just to play in the night
Caught me standing now I'm in there standing, we staying the night
Daddy left but that nigga never said goodnight
Man that wasn't right, now I want all the power
Expected a lot from that coward
And any second I'm bound to wow ya, all them beats I dealt
For like two years my, my all them beats I felt
I can massage my own dick I don't need your help
And I can crash my own whip, I don't need your belt
Tell me where the fuck was you when I couldn't feed myself
And all that wack shit help me be myself
I swear I never

[Hook x2]



[Snippet]

[Verse]
I'm up 3, up 3
Check the news
Double cup and perky, that's the remedy for the blues

[Verse]
Yeah
We've been outside
We've been outside
You can pull up to the crib for the stop by
29 I bust the line, no Rondo
Finna slide through, finna slide through
Yeah, don't make me come out just to find you
'Bout to make me go back to the low fade

[Hook]
Oh, I might go
I might go (yeah) I might go
Yeah, I might go out there
I might go
Yeah, I might go Subie
I might go
Yeah, I might go Subie



[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Okay, I got it, copy
20/20, but I can't see nobody
One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me
Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies
No that wasn’t my girl, that was just a hobby
Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby
Elevator up, no need to find me
Yeah, yeah
X-ray vision, see through you niggas
Newspaper stand, we press the issue
We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles
Right up at your hood, unload
Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental
Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals
Cookin' on a tune, I been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat
Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet
Gotta watch my back now, cause these niggas at me
All black in a Benz when I pull up on you

[Hook: Travis Scott]
They don't want to see me in the ends, in the ends
Don't let me catch you creeping here past 10, in the ends
From the tribe called check-a-hoe like Indian

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, I'm a dog with the dog pound
Oh yeah, La Flame checkin' in with the heat now
Oh yeah, having to eat now
Oh yeah, you went Whiteside on the rebound
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, running through the 713 with the check
Our necks iced out got a whole lotta bet
Hit it from the don whole lotta young respect
Oh yeah, copping hella dome on my jet
Oh yeah, god dammit got a whole new collect
Yeah, yeah, I've been sipping got my home in a wreck
Oh yeah, I'mma do the deal now
In the ends we might come and kick the door down
Oh yeah, when I follow through you oh now
Oh yeah, she gon' hit the damn C note when I pull up on you



[Snippet]
Yeah, family, family
Ooh, family
Power, I won't go

Family, family
Same friends
Still sittin' with the same ones in my top ten
Now we still sittin'

Outside, still link up with my cuzzo on the South side
Talkin' over cougars, get my hair tied
Yeah, late night

[Hook]
The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
And we gon' fly to Vegas
We gon' raise them glasses when I finally make it
And go home and hit up all the places
Where a nigga grew up and see these bitches I dated
So eager, to treat us like Caesars
I'mma catch amnesia, they gon' have they D's up
So I might remember, when the nights was dimmer
Had nobody to look to, older brother was iller
Seen the look in his eyes, then see straight to her soul
What he feeling inside, damn I never would know

[Hook]
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you
The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I’ll blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you
And I blame it all on you
And I blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

[Verse 2]
Sweet winter, got head before my dinner
Scream by the half and now we in the mirror
Around this time tonight, niggas is niggas
So we gon' hit the town tonight, roll up the killa
There go my soul, you get the picture
Holy grail filled with wine to pass time
What I fantasize in due time that come alive
And we just pray to god we all be still alive
And we so fly tonight
Hope a nigga touch the sky tonight

[Bridge]
And the stars is out so bright
Let 'em shine over you
And we dance across tonight
I blame it all on you

[Verse 3]
Shut the lights down when I’m in the place
The time is right now, feelin' out of space
It’s like '99, whatever happened to Ma$e
Gotta make it ahead of time like hookers in a race
We gon' shine before they hate us
Eat before the waiters, now more than ever

[Hook]
The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I'll blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you



[Hook: Travis Scott]
Never said it was easy was never easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Never said it was easy said it was easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Poppin on the lean, man Ive been off drug
Never said it was easy said it was easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Poppin on the lean, man Ive been of drug

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Gotta watch these hoes, yea, these hoes be sneakin'

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Ive been on a roll
Ive been on the keys
I just need some head
Got some memory
(x3)

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Never said it was easy was never easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Never said it was easy said it was easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Poppin on the lean, man Ive been off drug
Never said it was easy said it was easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Poppin on the lean, man Ive been of drug

[Verse: Unknown Feature]
Fornicate inside the bus
To the life, the life we love

You gotta [???]

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Never said it was easy was never easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Never said it was easy said it was easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Poppin on the lean, man Ive been off drug
Never said it was easy said it was easy
Made it out the grease, they made it look easy
Poppin on the lean, man Ive been of drug



[Verse 1]
You fucking nut, you acting ass, they laugh at us
Stupid bitch, you fucked it up, fuck is over why you toss the dust
With a mask on, when I looked at you I hope they pray for us
Hand tied to the sky, wonder how a nigga living so high
Is it cause the lights on me? It always rains on me
When I first came home, I was in the was in the feds, they took my kids
Homie
Living in a lie homie, man the devils alive, will I ever survive, I never die homie
Never knew in my life that I would step into fire

[Hook]
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa

[Verse 2]
Did it all for a little, did it all for my niggas
Shine hard for the bitches, put a mask on for the pictures
Different know from my homies, talk like you don’t know me
Damn its gonna cost tomorrow, all them drunk flicks you wanna show me
Funny how we back here, all my fam here
Twisting up while we rolling up with a wine glass on a glass pier
Went from sleeping at Tony home, moving back to where I was grown
Trippy how
A nigga life style makes me live my life wrong

[Hook]
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa

[Instrumental Break]

[Hook]
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa

[Verse 1]
88s in my projects, swear I came here to riot
With a gang of niggas, orangutan niggas
Playing Russian roulette in the lobby
With a gang of gold, fuck her face
Then hit the avenue, send her home, I think a cab will do
Never loved these hoes, I think I love this ho
Wait, (Shut the fuck up!)
Seven digits for the chain nigga
Egyptian sculpture for the rain nigga
When the flex bomb drop nigga cold homie
Coolin' out where it never rain nigga
Screamin hallelujah fuckin with the double x why'd ya do it?
Leave you hangin watch your momma mop the fluid
Now your casket closed screaming 'how they knew ya'

Pumpin' twist somethin', break it down

Gold 88, 88

I'm factin' niggas so popular
Shittin' all in yo binoculars

[Intro]
(Talking on the Phone)
She got a hold on me
Then she turnt around and go so cold on me
Almost frozed on me
Yeah I know
Na-na-na-now that bitch can't let me go

[Hook]
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy

[Verse 1]
I dozed off in this cabin
Damn, I woke up barely breathing
Damn, I can't believe what I'm seeing, bitch from last weekend
We all met up for drinks and
She standing same coat, still chiefing on that pinewood
I'm tryna' figure how I end up in these dry woods
About as high as I was, no clothes and I'm tied up
Look like life or death, and she staring me in eyes
So I had to wipe my eyes cause this shit ain't gone fly
So I had to go, broke out then I clocked out now it's time to roll
Should have know I shouldn't have boned but I had the dough
When I pulled out all the weed she pulled out the blow

[Hook]
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy

[Verse 2]
We took trips down to Marrows even shopped up at Meadows
She moved straight out the ghetto cause she deep down in that hell hole
Scholarships, daddy even let her drive all kind of whips
That's why I hear tire screeching
Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
I feel like she right behind me
But that ass might be outside
See all this gold right behind me, now that shit ain't no mirage
And she crazy like she Fonzy cause I won't have no menage
When I see me on the concrete man I swear I almost died
Somehow I jumped straight out my car seat not even I parked that shit outside
That bitch had me running down a dark street
How I made it out alive I don't know I must be slonky
How I know, now now I know

[Hook + Bridge]
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the, that bitch crazy, that bitch crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
The street lights, the street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights



[Hook]
Watch me
Watch me get louder, get louder
Watch me, ooh, watch me
Get louder, get louder

[Verse]
Watch me start standin' on the couches
Watch me start fuckin' on they spouses

Watch me start goin' up [?]
Watch me start, and I'll be here

You

All I really want is you

All I really wanted

[Intro]
(King Krule)
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside

Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Overnight just over night, I slipped into a cardiac
Slipped out my conscious don't know if I'm coming back, young maniac
Might go burn a roof, or what I'm supposed to do
Your rolling loner, walking living proof
A victim of the youth
Can I last one more hour?
Can you last one more night, cause I can make it
I ain't crazy, ain't need no doctor, I need patience
They be like "boy there, where yah been?"
I been and made it, swear I been ablazing, swear I been amazing
Godly feeling, bad bitches, silicone-a-feeling
Let me cop a feeling, dream fulfilling
Tryna remix a million and build a building, gah damn!
I need that Neptune Estate that's out in the Hamps!
You know last night was so crazy, that shit went HAM!
Me and Archie, 10 bitches in a 2 seater
He can't remember nigga, and me either
Ahh!

I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can stay in your mind
Wish me to stay away
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say
Dear brother
Can you tell that this faith is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay
I could stay in your mind
I could stay in your mind

Yeah, drop a six, make me drip (its lit)
Whoa, for my dog, hit a lick (straight up)
Whoa, every K, I'm with the click (alright)
Whoa
Uh, uh, uh, Juvenile off the mix (yah)



Diving a hearse, I dive and I curse
I dive at my worst, we dive and we lurk
Out on the scene, blowing on green
Denim my jeans, Molly you know where they're seen
Margiela dipping, I coast, I'm out on the boat
We freestlye, niggas is spitting rhymes off the throat
I'm moving, I'm scheming moving, I'm dodging and grooving
Sway in the Morning, nigga ain't losing
IPhone 6, I'm chirping and lurking the scene
You know I get it, blowin' I'm blowin' that mean
Mr. So Clean, no bald head the dreads never, the braids whether
You niggas out here changing the weather (rain)
My dollar bills are hundreds and fifties, no twenties
Tens, I never get it, money is plenty
On a billion dollar mind scheme, on the rhyme scheme
You know La Flame doing a hundred damn five things
Dressed here, with the retro, might pull up on your show Trillelectro
Might hit the Amsterdam with the mess low
La Flame coming through, with the next flow
I'm looking at the dash, it's 12:06
I'm looking at your girl, thats my bitch!
You took her out now, she living with (me)
I ain't rolling through, with written shit
This is straight flow, waking up at the 9AM, blowing dope
Nigga like me, I'm blowing smoke
Hotel at my door, like "you gotta go,"
I ain't leaving 'til 4, yeah you gotta know
Free the Snowman, free my nigga Meek Milly
He the first nigga showed me duffle bag with millie
Nigga put me in a Bentley, nigga blowing Philly
Had me out in Philly, after Wet Willies
Took 'em to Miami, took 'em to damn Diddy
Out on the boat rolling, I'm sipping on wet willies
Once again no Ciroc, I'm moving, I'm moving good
Shout my nigga Ye, we all G.O.O.D
Shout my nigga T.I, the Hustle Gang good
Shout my niggas, NY, I'm blowing Backwoods
You know how we get it, I'm kicking it freestyle
Days Before Rodeo, nigga go get wit it



Fuck out of my business/
I did things that most men would ask forgiveness/
Broke the code of commandments from my descendants/
Who gives a fuck? New Trojan in the building/
We ride with no limits/
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me trying to finish?/
I'm in a bad mood, rob that dude/
Fuck that couch, burn that house/
We the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror/
4,000 on the leather, you niggas should know better/
Them niggas new slaves, i do say.../
Fuck! Fuck! twice, only on a Tuesday/
When i'm in a bad mood/
Ooh nigga i'm wylin on 'em/
Ooh back balling on 'em/
I never feel the pain/
Only God can make it rain/
So i must be Mary, Joseph, Allah/
Kid of a disciple, thoughts are suicidal/
Jumping off the building, thinking like a psycho/
They trying to find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty/
It's alright, he's after the meds, Chris Bobby/
...Oh shit

[Verse 1]
Funny things is changing now we out of here
Ain't shit the same but jason ill admit
Seen my mama in pain she cried a hundred tears
So fucking tired so fucking many nights it got so hot in there
So tonight we at the time nigga blow them candles mane
Cause when its time to shine no need for candles mane
We some cocky niggas in the rocky niggas
Rocking dolo Will & Rich in here we from the traffic nigga
See the problem is yeah, we too proud of this
Now-now, the problem is, too many columns is anonymous
We too proper nigga get a prop for this
And we can take a trip to Karen nigga get a shot of this
Dodge a copper-opper cab will give a shit
Go to class but not for the scholarship
Here's a different scholar she a dolly pouter
Here's a problem with my holy grail, ain't got no holy water
I'm too slonky, tony hates this part about it
When the keys roll up the car, you can roll if you with it yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Mirror mirror, on the wall, who the freshest of em all? Tell em
That shit is wack, them niggas in the mall they sellin
Think about it, she stay in the Margiela
Trippy done slip on the floor, bout 4 of my bros
Stepping these hoes, vanilla

[Verse 2]
Candy be keep tapping that hoe, we hopping that area code
Some how if they figure that Harry and Mary are bros
They end up just rocking the tote
Circles around, you be calling up everything gold
Them niggas is southerners niggas be rapping and popping
Not give a fuck about those
The same ones giving me 5, is seeing me live
The girl they chilling beside, be giving me sage
Tripping all night, bout moving them boobies aside
Sneak in and out of the crib
But definitely Holly committed to giving me rights

[Hook]
Mirror mirror, on the wall, who the freshest of em all? Tell em
That shit is wack, them niggas in the mall they sellin
Think about it, she stay in the Margiela
Trippy done slip on the floor, bout 4 of my bros
Stepping these hoes, vanilla

[Verse 1]
She take a shot of Hennessy
I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this shit for him and me
I'm the next lone star to blow-up
Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Close to stealing and killing, just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces look like an emoji
The rav four turned into a Rover
Til' I took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now my money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on
My fifty seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eating all day, itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it

[Hook]
No... noo... nooo...
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off
Falling off, never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off

[Verse 2]
Last snap time
Disrespectful rap time
Turn a nigga flat line
“Wannabe trill nigga now?” That time?
You feel me?
We dont want that here no more
Cause we dont wanna rhyme
I did it all on my own
And I did it on time

[Hook]
No... noo... nooo...
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing
They will never catch me



[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Close your eyes and let your brain jet
Pop off the plane and speaking in the accent
Dreams so serene



[Snippet]
Always jammin'
All my niggas turned in his bitch
Yeah, make it good, make it good



[Yung Lean]
I picture myself being higher
I wipe my face off with a towel
I'm smoking spirits, I'm a fighter
I'm so wasted

[Hook: Travis Scott & Yung Lean]
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
Mix the sprite with Xanny, lean, that's how we taste it
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
Get the right side [?] is so amazing
I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted (Lean do her)

Night times from a time cold
You really wanna say yes but you sayin' no

Yeah, she let me smash her friends 'long as the chain froze
Yeah, Ain't been here 15 minutes why she changed clothes

[Instrumental]



[Playing "Antidote" ]

[Peter Rosenberg] Travis can we start off with uh what the name of your album is and what the hell it means cause when I saw it I was deeply confused

[Travis Scott]
My albums called Birds in The Trap Sing McKnight
And I'mma keep it short for this explanation
But, its basically its you know
Anybody creative thats kind of like been stuck and had a problem getting the idea out, it took me 8 months just to get the "90210" video out, with Hype Williams
It took me six months just to get the action figure out
It shouldn't take no one, no artist that long, you know
Just to you know get something idea out
Especially something thats going to culturally shift
You know, the world musically
Now the music's more towards the independent artists
I feel like in a couple years
We all be able to fly around and do what we want

[Rosenberg] But Why Sings McKnight?

[Travis Scott]
Cause, I wanted Andre 3000 with the whole album
I had this play idea, Act I, Act II, Act III
And then later on I was like
With the visuals I can make it more of a play
But theres no way I can make a album out of a play
I'm too much of a rager for this shit to be like (sorry, stuff)
For Stuff, for stuff to be to that you know
I didn't want people to overthink it
I didn't want it to look too much so I feel like the
Only thing that needed to be complicated was my title
People to understand it, and the music straight forward

[Rosenberg]
And thats exactly what it is you could have a party to this album and just let the whole album play

[Ebro] What do you want to listen to?

[Travis Scott]
I want to start with "the ends" thats my favorite song even if you skippin' around you gotta start there
Travis Scotts taking over the show
It's Travis Scott in the morning

[Playing "The Ends"]

[Playing "Pick Up The Phone"]
It's Travis Scott its HOT 97 in the morning

[Rosenberg]
Wait why do you get to talk
It's Travis Scott in the morning, let him say it

[Travis Scott]
It's Travis Scott in the morning
Hot 97,  Ebro, Rosenberg, Laura Styles lets get it

[Peter Rosenberg]
Ebro I don't know if you realize this
Theres probably a pretty good chance, knowing Hot 97
It will be Travis Scott in here at some point and I'll still be sitting in the same seat, its a pretty good chance

[Ebro]
I think what happens is they bump you out and keep me, in a order thats the order of operation

[Ebro]
Wait, Travis out of all the young artists, you are on what, your third project now, you were one of the artists I gravitated to first just cause I can understand what you're saying
I'm just figuring out Young Thug, like I was late to it, but the style of music that you're creating who, who were you inspirations, who did you pattern yourself after, you're 24 now?

[Travis]
I looked up to M.I.A. and Kid Cudi man he's really one of the main dudes I kinda looked at and listened to all the time
He saved my life
He saved me from doing random bad things to myself
Kept me focused like..

[Ebro]
Just through his music or personal relationship

[Travis Scott]
Just through his music because I didn't meet him 'til
The first time I met Kanye was the first time I ever met him
But I didn't really meet no Cudi until like earlier like
Late late late last year when he came by the studio one time just to like talk to me

[Rosenberg]
What was it about Cudi's music that spoke to you so much?

[Travis Scott]
I feel like he really dialed in on like, the youth and really dialed in on like, inspiration, how to inspire you
His words were very selected, on like what to do
I feel like he always made the soundtrack to my life
Or anybody's life who was like going through the same thing
If you a big Cudi fan you know exactly what I'm sayin' like, he says the exact same things you growing up with
But makes it sound way cooler
I went through this, I went through that
My mom didn't have this, we had to go through this
You know we had to go through Christmas to do this
But the beats and everything just sounded like
You know, the Nutcracker

[Rosenberg]
Do you think, do you think
And you were saying off the air too
Do you think he gets credit for being a cultural influence?

[Travis Scott]
Nah not at all cause I think, you know
Cudi should be like a top tier artist up there man alongside
With these other artists who like, are number one, you know
I think he fathered a lot of, a lot of the music
A lot of style of music

[Ebro]
Well, we know what he did for Kanye for sure, like
Everybody talks about that

[Travis Scott]
He's a good influence and you know, a good help
His writing and his mind
He makes beats I don't think people know that
He made "Sky Might Fall" you know, he made mad beats
He made some beats on 808s and heartbreak, he's super dope he can write

[Rosenberg]
Speaking of which, who did the beats on this album, on your record

[Travis Scott]
Vinylz, I always work with Wondagurl on every album
Can't do a album without her
TM, this kid named dax, Murda, Cardo
Its weird though, I only have 4 producers or something like that 4-5 producers

[Ebro]
You wrote with and worked with Rihanna
You wrote with and worked with Kanye West on several things
Some other artists, I don't want to run through the whole thing But what else are you doing besides writing your verses

[Travis Scott]
Well when I first came into the game I made beats
Thats what I did, I had to give people my own beats
As a artist I lost a lot of lot of lot of time to make beats
I wanted to focus on raps because I felt like when I came up here I wasn't the best rapper, I had the best beats
I was doing Cruel Summer, I worked on Yeezus
With those albums, like by the I got to Jay Z albums
I was already having ill songs, so it just turned into me just giving people my songs, you know
On 'Ye album or her album, so on
I sat and worked with them on the whole album
Whether it was for two or three months, picking mad beats
Whether its different people beats or, taking out the drums
Putting my drums

[Rosenberg]
How do you know how to like craft something for someone else

[Travis]
I always see it, I'ma tell ya'll something about myself
I was always making music

[Rosenberg] You were mimicking other stash

[Travis]
Mimicking other artists, when I was 13-14 years old
Making beats and making music just to get the sound, right
And so like, I think every producer, any young producer
So like when they make like their favorite rapper
Made that beat, make the same rap just to understand okay this how they did it

[Ebro] To Understand

[Travis]
Just to understand it completely, okay the breakdown
So when I grew up, I was like you gotta translate it to your own songs, so that kinda grew me up like welded me
I'm a big fan of people man, a lotta people feel themselves

[Laura]
Thats so important that you say that because
Not a lot of people come out and say yo I'm a true fan and I love

[Rosenberg]
Who are you the biggest stan of you've worked with so far, musically

[Travis Scott]
Kid Cudi but
But I'mma say, I'mma say, I've been in the studio with Jay-Z dawg
And at first I was not that a big of a Jay-Z fan bro
But bro, bro, bro bro
I don't even know how old this guy is (no one knows)
This dude, I've never seen him pick up a pen
I seen him do the Magna Carter
This dude's freestylin' the whole album, with facts though
You know, him and Andre 3000 too though
Lotta people be talkin' bout Andre
Like why he not dropping music
Man that man has information man
He know how to play the piano man like
Frank Sinatra style, Beethoven style

[Laura] Do you have information on his new Outcast album

[Travis Scott] I'm not talking about that man

[Laura]
I tried to get it out

[Ebro]
It's Travis Scott takeover, let me bail him out
We don't want this to get crazy we want this to go right

[Rosenberg]
What's your favorite
Of the songs you've been involved in for other people, whats the one you're most proud of? The one they hear it on the radio
They're like man thats a great record, I'm glad I did that

[Travis]
You know what, the most I'm proud of is uhh
The one thats not out yet man, the one thats not out yet
Hopefully come
I know that

[Ebro] What are you sayin'? I don't understand what you're saying
So its Birds In The Trap, there's song you didn't put on it?

[Rosenberg]
No you mean a song with someone else, a collab, collab

[Travis] Oh you said a collab

[Rosenberg]
Like you worked on a record
You worked on a Kanye song or a Rihanna song
When you hear it you're like yes I love that

[Ebro] What are you saying, I don't understand

[Rosenberg] No with someone else a collab

[Travis]
Oh I thought you said a album I thought you're sayin' a collab

[Travis]
Oh yeah thats what I'm saying the song thats not out yet

[Rosenberg] Oh its with someone big? its with a singer?

[Travis]
Yeah its with Kid Cudi. Facts

[Rosenberg]
He says that based on Facts

Ebro
Well lets get into another record from Birds in The Trap Sing McKnight, what do you want to play man

[Travis] lets do that sweet sweet
You gotta prep em "sweet sweet" then "goosebumps"

[playing "Goosebumps"]

[Travis]
Shoutout K Dot
Thank you Punch bro, I love you, you the man

[Rosenberg]
Were you surprised like did you know you would get that done
Or were you surprised when it got done

[Travis]
I'mma keep it all the way 100 man
A lot of these features on the album
I was surprised every time someone was like, Yo I'mma at least try

I'mma at least try, when I hit up Brock shoutout Brock
I need this K-dot verse
I seen he had a show
I seen they were singing "Antidote" and was doing it with them
Like I'm on Kendrick radar
That was the second time I was him, I met him at the VMA's before like
He walked up to me like yo man my names kendrick da da da
Yo, your music is very inspirational, I love it, its like super dope
I love your last album, I was like what?
You be barring, bro you be barring N's out like
You be R.I.Ping N's on the track man like
You just walked up to me and was just like yo
I'm Travis, when I be rappin', I be really listening to your music
Like this dude just said a lot of bars man
These raps I got be lookin' like this spaced out man
I'm like man

[Laura]
Were you in the studio with Kendrick when you recorded

[Travis]
Nah cause he was dropping that album
I think he dropped the Untitled album
So as soon as that album came out
He sent me, Brock sent me the verse
Like "yo he hit you with the verse"
I listened to the whole song I always thought the song was so good
Yo when that dude hit the high note
I was like yo man this dude is on some other shit
I think he really go in the booth and make moments when he's 'bout to kill peoples tracks
I think they make R.I.P. tees when he bout to go in
They press em up like
We bout to do this Control verse
We bout to do this Travis verse
We bout' to RIP everybody, like for the year
We gon' line up everybody grave sites
Like, boom we got Travis right here

[Rosenberg] the Khaled one, he went crazy

[Travis Scott]
I think he purposely..
I be wanting to call him man, like who you mad at bro
You be blacking out on these things like
But thats the mental man
And thats why he the greatest artist man cause he got that focus man
Cause I don't care if its a feature, I'm treating it like its my song
You know what I'm saying, and as a artist, thats how I treat the beats when ya'll see me get on a feature like the "No Limit" Usher joint I had to redo the whole drums on the whole thing
I ain't like the drums, I wanted the drums to be harder

[Rosenberg]
And You could tell someone like Usher like nah I don't like this the way it is

[Travis Scott]
Yeah, Usher came to me like if you wanna do the drums man take it over, and I was like, Thank You

[Rosenberg]
But thats gotta be a crazy honor coming from someone like Usher

[Travis Scott]
But thats what I'm sayin' like
I be in the studio with these guys and like
They be like yo man, please man just like
Take the drums, take whatever
Take this out, you know what I'm sayin'
And I just be like yo ,this dude know how to turn this up
This dude know how to do this, he know how to do this
I can do this, I can get us all in a room
And this is whats gonna happen, know what I'm saying

[Rosenberg]
A few years ago, everybody was talking about you
I think it was the freshman show
You come through, and there's T.I involved
Theres Kanye involved, theres nine different labels involved
And the conversation in the industry
Theres a thousand chefs in the kitchen
Is it ever gonna come out
Is the Travis Scott thing ever gonna
Are you super satisfied you are out there you are fully a entity

[Travis]
Yeah yeah its just so weird
People think these dudes are with me all the time
Thats just not the case at all
I probably talk to these guys 3, 4, 5, 15 times a year

Ebro
You start at three and went to fifteen


[Travis] Three times a year
I might talk to T.I. three times a day in one setting

[Rosenberg]
Right it just depends
Who total do you work with besides those big names?
It was a third one too?
It was Kanye, T.I. and someone

[Travis] Nah nah nah I'm only signed to T.I. and Kanye

[Rosenberg] Have you talked to Kanye

Travis: I talk to 'Ye every single day

[Rosenberg] Who's crazier you or Kanye

[Travis]
Both of us I can't say one of us is more crazier than the other

[Rosenberg]
Are there ever times he's going off giving ideas and you're like
"damn Kanye you goin' in right now"
And there are times he looks at you like
"damn Travis you really got ideas man"

[Travis]
Yeah we really be looking at each other like damn we just really be like

[Rosenberg]
I have audio of travis and Kanye talking
This is what is sounds like
Bro, Bro, Bro, Bro, for 90 minutes
At least minimum

[Playing "outside"]
And I got a special verse coming for that in a couple days

Ebro
And we gotta talk about these new projects you said you were gonna tell us about
And this is okay to tell us about
You're not gonna mess anything up

[Travis]
No we got gonna mess nothin' up, I got you

[Rosenberg]
I keep secrets, don't believe the hype man
[Rosenberg]
Hold on, you can't leave without telling us about the G.O.OD. Music release

[Travis Scott]
Cruel Winter, I'm executive producing that album
Its coming very soon, I wanna say like the top of next year
I'm putting the pressure on everybody, I'm saying February

[Ebro]
How many songs done right now for Cruel Winter

[Travis Scott]
I would say we have a lot of songs done
How many songs picked, I wanna say a handful
We got a lot of songs done
We just gotta sit down and lock in all on a wave

[Rosenberg]
Everybody's involved, Desiigner on there too?

[Travis Scott]
Kanye West, every G.O.O.D. music artist involved
Every G.O.O.D. music artist involved
Every G.O.O.D. music artist involved
Every G.O.O.D. music artist involved
Its like amazing, and you know
We got like our illest friends
And its going to be one of the illest projects
But one thing I can say about this project is
Its going to be very youthful, straight to the point
Like the illest ever man, just like the best album

[Ebro]
What does that mean? youthful

[Travis]
That means the kids that are not on the radio all the time
Who really got the clubs going ridiculous
Really have the fields going crazy thats what this album is for

[Rosenberg]
Real quick speaking of Kanye what has Kanye told you about your album, what does he think?

[Travis]
Man you know honestly he called me like "Yo"
I just finished the album on the Saint Pablo tour right
He called me like "Yo man I didn't know it was this crazy
I heard you when you were mixing it but just yo
It sounds way crazier listening to it 1-14"
That's what got everybody so excited for Cruel Winter
How I just finished that album like the last couple of weeks
This is the album Travis working on the bus, yeah
Everyone so confused

Another one

Pick up that album Birds in The Trap Sing McKnight

Hot-boxin' at a high speed (Yah, yah)

Yuh, rockstar, heavy metal, no guitar
Why you pay so much for yo' Nissan? Because it's GTR
First, I shift it, click it, burnin' rubber like I'm movin' dark (Yah)

Ride in a Coupé, I'm all alone now
In the fast lane, I can not slow down
I gotta watch my back when I go out
Cause the people that had my back a bunch of sellouts

[Verse 5 : Takeoff]
If they jail me up right now, bet I'll bail out
Me and 12 engines in the rear now
Always doubted me, but tell 'em that we here now

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rockstars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind X2

[Hook]
But the nights keep fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey X2

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Summer time was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with will&rich and kwazi motos
So we popped the champagne so drunk spilled liquor all over her vera wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: QuiZzY]
White girls lying to their mum for the lines
Black boys do the crimes for the lines
You dealing or buying or you're way out of line
We be speaking to the tyrants that be twinkling and shinin
Bitches crying rivers cuz I left em behind
Got that liquor in my liver while I trip and recline
This bitch keep callin but im clicking decline
We live in a time,where the shit in our mind
Is to get on our grind,im ruthless for the paper
I spit the truth in the booth,and I ain't care about a hater
Plus im getting high, got a pack of northern lights
My sword is bright,ive sworn to fight as the warrior night
To protect those who sold their souls over night
So if you get in our way you will get pulverized
Im a monster, you better run bitch
You lucky that the night is over, see you at sunset

[Hook]

Surviving in a world that makes me a businessman
But it makes that girl a whore, no more, be gone, you a whore
I'm Americon no comment on it

Bitch grab the karmet and clean it up, we outta here on the ? spaceship to the bahamas
Take up our armors, im going bonkers, listen to the Grim Reaper ?
Go to Sleep, wait you better pause it.. ha

[Intro: Rick Rubin]
The power of nature is such that it's what all art strives to be

[Hook]
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain’t what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world

[Verse 1]
Last week was the last week
I turned my back and let my ass [?]
Dropped out and subtracted some niggas
It made more than my math teacher
Lookin' dead in the mirror, lookin' back how we did it
Makin' trips to them dealers, guess it paid off nigga
Sip this wine in fine clarity
Marijuana, the youth therapy
Swervin' on my old hoes that drove to insanity
I guess that was all straight out of vanity
To my kids, that was plan to be
That was all, the inhumanity
Life's an adventure, with a lot of action
Lucky I'm fresh, in the Dime fashion
A class act, called a class act
Funny, lookin' back, wonder where my class at

[Hook]
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain’t what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world
(Fell out of love, feel like the Royal Rumble)

[Verse 2]
Fell out of love, feel like a Royal Rumble
Hard to be humble when you rock in the jungle
Stumblin', everybody was stumbled
Over that dresser, [?] in that [?]
In the [?], left it in the vessel
Poor girl, ain't even the show girl

Blowjob, only your own job

[Hook]
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain’t what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world



[Verse 1]
Fuck outta my business
I did things that most men will ask forgiveness
Broke the code, the commandments from my descendants
Who gives a fuck? New children in the buildin' (step back)
Ride with no limits
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?
I'm in a bad mood
I'm in a bad mood

[Verse 2]
Rob that dude, fuck that couch, burn that house
Hol' on, you too close
I keep a classy one for the toast
'Cause my ghetto one do the most
Man, I'm so serious
Don't fucking talk to me
I'm in a bad mood
Oooh, your skin mahogany
Oooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze
Had me trickin' 40k for some grades
Just to make 40k for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day
I'm in a good mood

[Verse 3]
Oooh, I'm wildin' on 'em, oooh back pilin' on 'em
I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain
So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah
Kid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal
Jumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho
They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty
Anxiety after the meds, Kris Bobbi

[Intro: Theophilus London]
Where the weather is warm

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Wake up, bake up, hit the [?] all I see is them [?]
Cop lights, no lights, cause them bills it was overdue
Skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking walks to the side of the moon
Gotta take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, don’t wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I’m on some popular shit, come look in my eyes to get a fix
We just gon' cruise, hit the brews, don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
Got the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can’t be realer, me and my niggas by the villa
She in that white dress it can’t fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink it like she got no liver
I hit it and she on the moon my nigga

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
They peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn’t working out
Kiss my momma for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can’t wait
In the moonlight you can’t see my eyes
And when I’m off the things I can’t think
Damn I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can’t choke
When they recognize a real nigga skill
Ride with me, down with me, kept me afloat
Now all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long



[Intro]
Yeah, ill America baby
Scott, La Flame
Ill America baby

[Verse 1]
Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin'
Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, and Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your bitch just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'
In fact that nigga prolly missin'

[Hook]
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas
M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-I-M-I-M-I-A-I-M-I-A

[Verse 2]
Speedin', and damn I'm leanin' on a Kawasaki
In the lobby, then we 'dro codeinin', out in Abu Dhabi
Chain beamin', man, I hope you ain't anemic
Cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, it's just me and four women
And we all playin' hockey
Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane
Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass
Fuck up the flow, nothin' but fam cause niggas be hoes
You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ
When I stock it up and then go
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs
My nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho house
Spillin' booze where the Barbie at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga
Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at?
If Scottie ain't totin' or swimmin' in women
He writin', producin' and scorin' and filmin'

[Hook]
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas
M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-I-M-I-M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-MI-M-I-M-I-A-MI
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm in these streets it's been a long day (bands)
Bout to sign this deal and throw it all away (bands)
Bout to cop the crib that Dame lost today (bands)
Funny, look at them niggas that slipping
You trippin', no fear, my niggas, we get it (bands)
I'm looking down at the whole world through these glass ceilings (bands)
And when I step outside, bad bitches with me (bands)
Back in my section, twisting that la la can't let it stress me (bands)
Wake up, fall asleep to Dizzy Gillespie (bands)
Ba-back it up and break it down (bands)
She gon' bust it on this dick, you gon' take her out of town (bands)
I put ice in my veeners, I put rubies in my crown (bands)
Count them stacks and blow them racks, niggas know who they around

[Hook]
I got bands (oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow

If we take all of these shots, we gon' go berserk (bands, shut the fuck up)
Bitch you trippin', really though lately [?] smoke, lots of hoes down to blow (bands)
Vamanos, time to go, we gon' go straight to the workin' now (bands)

Lately, I been goin' crazy
Laughin', drinkin', find myself in arms of different women, huh
Toast it, I need to use my cerebellum
Tried to tell ‘em cut that rap shit all that wack shit's underwhelming
Time's ticking, palms itching
Mind's tripping, tired of living, mad decisions, I'll kill ‘em

[Bridge]

I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands

[Hook: Travis Scott]

I got bands (oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure

[Intro - Thirty Seconds to Mars]
(Do you believe?) Walk on water

[Verse 1 - Jared Leto]
Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust in a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
"Times are changing"
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

[Chorus - Jared Leto]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

[Verse 2 - Jared Leto]
Look at the sky, see a dying star
White lies, it's a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

[Chorus - Jared Leto]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

[Verse 3 - Travis Scott]
For this life, I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M's, sweet like candy cane, yeah
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang, yeah
Yeah, for this life, I cannot change, yeah
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main, yeah
M&M's, sweet like candy cane, yeah
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang, yeah

[Bridge - Thirty Seconds to Mars]
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water

[Chorus - Jared Leto]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe? Walk on water)
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
(Do you believe? Walk on water)
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

[Outro - Thirty Seconds to Mars]
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water



(Snippet)

[Hook]
I tried to buy the whole mall for ya
You said it's too small for ya (yeah)
I tried to buy the whole mall for ya
You said it's too small for ya



[Travis Scott: Verse 1]
You the one, you know me the best
You the one I call when I'm stressed
Loves strong, but money can’t buy you that
How do I say I need you back
