[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her "do better"
She said "how 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"
How 'bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend?
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
'Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

When I die, bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that block-ow
Dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet
It's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas
Don’t try me, I’ll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game’s so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word

You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie

That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne
You want true, that’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out
And I say: "Damn, that makes two of us."
Aww, that look like what’s her name
Chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy
I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like
So one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm
Go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full
So I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
We don’t talk shit, we just state facts, yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word

Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some
I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take him out, bring 'em in, them whole things
2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t
Went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa & 2 Chainz]
It's Young Khalifa, man
2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight

This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
I ride or die for mine
I’m ride or die material
Only one life to live, so here we go
(This moment, we own it)

But the stripper happy, but they wish they had me
And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I fucked her so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big, I told her to look back at it
Look back it, look back it

Three mil in a month
But I just did three years on a bunk
Oh, you in a slump
I'm headed to Oakland like  Kevin Da Runt
What is your point?
Square with the stamp, for Kevin Durant
Lay on on my trap
Play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat

Yes that's why I'm crowned queen, and I ain't lookin' for the prom king
These hoes' careers ain't promising, killing these bitches -- crime scene
Oooh that's how a bitch do it
Fifty black trucks gonna follow when I pull up
This shit hit you in the chin like a pull up
My door so cocky, my door so stuck up
Oooh hop up out the space car
Bitches stay pressed, I call them a space bar
Man I wish a bitch would, hundred-thousand dollar engine, I wish a bitch could

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Wait I don't even think these niggas understood what the fuck I just said
I said, hundred-thousand dollar engine
I wish a bitch could, like the little engine that could
2 Chainz!



[Intro]
Yuck Daddy
Yuck Daddy

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talking on the FLX phone
Poof, just like that the whole check gone
Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun gang, all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in her tummy
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black Mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that
Nigga I'm so dope, you could catch a fucking contact

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Good weed, bad bitch
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
Woah I seen it all before
The bitch gotta man but she scheming on the low
How it go, it go fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers
Codeine, no liquor
Man life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I'm fucked, let's fuck
She said she on her period, I said yuck
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chains, one big chopper bitch

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got the chopper for the correspondents
The codine got me standing horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontases
And this shit is off the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, laying with my seat back
We next, weed never left Holland, weed bag
All this ice on me and my niggas playing freeze tag
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him
I come through with the yopper on
Turn that nigga into hot bologna
I'm the type a nigga cop a Rolly, cop a Benz, cop a tool
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu
Uh, I'm from the trap where the block'll pay you
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato
I be like you could get her
He be like you could get her
I be like you could have her
He be like you could have her
He be like it don't matter
I be like, me neither
Uh, my old school got twenty-sixes on it
And I got you girl kissing on me

[Hook]

[Outro]

Damn right, bro

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
4 AM, I'm just gettin' started
For my birthday I threw me a surprise party
Reminiscin' 'bout the trap, playin' the first Carter
My life changed when I had my first daughter
Got my first quarter flippin' fifty-dollar slabs
Your nigga's lookin' at the bills, askin' you for half
Cut from a different cloth, take pride in results
Anytime she wanna dip I'm providin' the sauce
You on side of the boss, so you kind of the boss
You keep playin' with me, I end up signing your boss
Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas
Rock with Champagne P
If it wasn't for the struggle then I wouldn't be me
Call me Deuce or Dos, anything but broke
Got my aim from the scope, got the game by the throat, damn!

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (straight up)
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (it's lit)

I ain't wanna fuck the bitch but she was fine, ooh
Hold up baby, let me take my time, ooh
Hard to get some head and try to drive, ooh
Jumpin' out the cake and that's surprisin', ooh
Pickin' up the duffel bag like exercisin', ooh
Bought mama new house 'cause she deserve it, ooh
Practice makes perfect but nobody's perfect, ooh
Escobar is not open for service, ooh
Send you to Dr. Miami for your surgery, ooh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (straight up)

Drop off a bag of some dangerous (yeah)
I'ma hit you, 4 AM, see if you make it (yeah)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz & Travis Scott]
Ooh, Riccardo Tisci on the crewneck
Ooh, On a killin' rapper spree and nigga, you next
Ooh, they talkin', chillin', watchin' Netflix (straight up)
Ooh, I used to trap and watch bootlegs
Ooh, I'm on my wave like a durag
Ooh, I see your boo, now where your crew at?
Ooh, talkin' tequila for the pipe-up
Ooh, I hope you got a clean vagina, yeah
Drench god, drench god, really

Got me a job sellin' records
Had to use my jeweler for a reference
Might buy a charm with the extras
Might use her legs for a necklace

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (straight up)

[Outro]
Don't stop trappin', boy

Everybody in here pregnant, 'cept my partner and them
But we gettin' this money though, I'm tellin' you that



[Intro: 2 Chainz]
I'ma tell you, I'ma tell you this right now
If you, if you woke up this mornin', nigga you winnin' for real
(Buddha Bless this beat)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I got a big amount, I took a different route
I am the pick of the litter
I was in juvy, they gave me community
I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin'
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas
I got my reasons, you wanna please me
Send me the pussy, not pictures
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'
She turn a freak on the liquor
Yeah, I am a boss on these bitches
Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches
Yeah, rock double cross on these bitches, yeah
Dearly departed, gather today
On some Prince shit
You know what they say
Me and my safe, got a friendship
Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid
Gettin' laid
Bitch made, took off sick days
6 trey, 6-4 bounce, bitch, bounce
Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Black out when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, "Pick a fur"
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me
'Cause these niggas actin' too fishy

[Interlude: Drake]
Fuck y'all niggas on, man?
Duffle bag forever
Just left V Live
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, "You bad and you know it"
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go
Nigga, long live Bankroll
Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold
Somebody, everybody know
6 God with the god flow
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Okay, so I got the ambiance just where I want it (yeah)

My ego is enormous like my crib in California (hmm)
If you ain't got no heart, man you gonna need a donor
Now I said I'm from the corner of the ATL (yah)
Where we got that clientele, avoid paper trails (right)
Broke so many bales down that I'm shell shocked (bow)
I held Glocks, sold rocks by the mailbox (ooh)
Got a vibe, make a yellow chick turn her neck (alright)
Got a vibe, make a cougar wanna spend a check (check)
Got a vibe, make an Asian want hibachi (hibachi)
Got a vibe, make Italian want Versace (Versace)
Carbon copies get declined, I'm the pioneer
Beat that pussy up, I need riot gear

When I woke up this morning
All I could think about was you
Cause when I went to sleep last night
All I could think about was you
Adam and Eve don't eat that fruit
'Best believe I'mma eat that Boo
Cause I'm the nigga that told them niggas
That told them niggas, 'Bout you
Chuck the deuce, while I'm ridin' through
Tityboi I might sign a boob
Your nigga hatin', tell your nigga that's hatin'
That if he gettin some paper I might sign him too
'Best believe I'm just slidin' through
Put your panties to the side let me slide through
I can see you niggas from a side view
I'm in and out the pussy, drive through
White coupe, with the white rims
I like to crank the top and let the light in
You know she dark skin her friend light skin
Put us together, and it's Ice cream
Sandwiches she can't manage it
I know her man Is sick, she can't handle it
She need some time alone I told her call my phone
And when she call my phone I didn't answer it

[Hook]
K.o
I'm gonna smoke till you niggas can't smoke no more
Roll till your bitches can't roll no more
K.o
I'm gonna blow till you niggas can't blow no more
Blow till your bitches can't blow no more
K.o

[Sample]
I was in Detroit, Michigan after going to go visiting with some friends of mine

[Big Sean's verse]
B-I-G
Okay I'm in motion, I'm rollin' and smoking
And smoking and rollin' like I'm locomotion
I'm walking outside and I'm causing commotion
Got perp and champagne that's a real nigga potion
I'm burnin' bread toasin' and joking
Cause I went from views of my moms house to views of the ocean
Niggas talk shit, But that's free promotion
I'm living my life like the end is approaching
Man fuck these niggas with a passion
I'm gettin' paid from the cradle to the casket
My Grandma said boy you need to read a bible chapter
Till I bought her ass a house bigger than the Pastor's,Hallelujah
Your now fucking with a bad bitch connoisseur
My ex-girl said man the fame caught up to ya
Baby you don't still think about me, wet dream about me
I swear you use to couldn't wait to k.o

[Hook]
Blow till your bitches can't blow no more

Chance of that is unlikely; 2 Chainz in my white T
I wipe her down and I pipe her down, I give my girl money to go out of town
You give your girl money to go to Niketown and I one-night her, you must like her
Kill niggas with one-liners, all I need is one lighter
Counting so much money (so much money), I got arthritis
So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em
If she gets this business then I {make her fall in love}
With a nigga like me I’m killing this beat - skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet on my sheets
On top, from the back, I thundercat like (HOE!)
My girl got a big purse with a purse in it
And her pussy so clean I can go to church in it!
Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E
How ya like me now, it’s cool but she want Mo D
Moet by the fireplace, this is how desire taste
And I’m bout to buy a case (Le'go)

[Hook]

Kitchen all pyrexed up, if my dick talked it’d say "next up" (dang)
Me and yo girl networked, now she wanna know my net worth
Wood grain, chestnut, titty fuck, chest nut! (yah)
Move shit, UPS truck, pull a lil' out n out the rest up
Competition need to rest up {make her fall in love}
I aim at ya head, put the vest up, matter fact put the vest up!
This shit I’m shootin is penetrating (bow), you don’t want this situation
Tall nigga with a short temper, I do this for niggas who never had shit
And now I got me a bad bitch, who got a bad bitch, who got a bad bitch (Tru)
TRU story, high like 2 stories, 2 Chainz and Tity Boi
Nigga that’s 2 stories, who want it?

I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
I been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?



[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Thank God for the first nigga started trapping
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em
I got a problem with these niggas
I got a problem with these bitches
Trigger finger keep itchin'
I pull it, I do it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflage down put your camera phone down
If she got an ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'mma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa

[Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em come to the crib and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
Tunechi...

[Drake]
That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Well, if you know like I know that pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than the snot nose, man all these hoes is my hoes
If she bougie fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend
Don’t cross that line its paper thin
High as a star, make a wish
I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch

[2 Chainz]
You hate that bitch, well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you’re riding on your skateboard
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib
Man fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat
I am so cold I need a cover and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Outro]
Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3
Right now it's me time
A little time for myself, me time
Oh yeah, right now it's me time
Don't want no one else now, me time
Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone
Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone
Please, please don't stop by my home
No, no cause I feel it's just matter of time
Till you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind
Right now it's me time
You need to go kick rocks now
Me time



[Intro]
Mama, MAMA!
(Wha, What!)
You get that money out my pants last night?
(Boy! Naw I ain't get no money out yo pants! And quit yellin' at me!!)
Ain't nobody hollin' at you!

I had a dream that rap wouldn't work
I woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold

[Verse 1]
I got Medusa on my sneakers
My dick up like "nice to meet ya"
100K for a feature, hundred K's at my leisure
Then we aim at your people
I be higher than a eagle
When I'm sipping on that codeine
Free my nigga Sigel
Ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flexin' ghostas
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some
I'm all that and then some, my trap house is my income
And it's booming

[Hook]
I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block, hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold

[Verse 2]
2 Chainz!
I'm ballin' like Mr. Clean
I gotta keep my kitchen clean
God bless me like I'm finna sneeze
Doctor weigh me on a triple beam
D-boy in parenthesis
All gold in my amenities
2 Chainz, two pinky rings
My trigger finger's like a lemon squeeze (Baow!)
Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked
And my vision is Pyrex
I do it big like a 5X
Killed they ass with the eyepatch
I got bad bitches on my side
I done fucked around and got sidetracked
My first night, I spent five stacks
Next night I forgot to count
I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out?
I'm the fireman, I put fire out
Got a pole in my basement
Tipped your girl like Maliah now
Ridin' on these motherfucka's until they blow my tires out, uh

[Bridge]
My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, wrist?"
My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, stove?"
All this jewelry on then I'm out cold
So much money on me, it won't even fold!

[Hook]
I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block, hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold



PART 1: Dresser[Produced by London On Da Track]

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
.454, I pull up on niggas, I tell 'em lets get it
Niggas they talkin' on Twitter, you niggas you know you gon get it
Benjamin Franklin, niggas know that I keep it 100
Got me a new clip for my .223 and that bitch hold a hundred
I'm still in the hood, I got me a check and I don't want no Nike's
Bitches, they suckin', and fuckin', they do everything except bite it
I can go slow like an old man, I can go fast like I got nitrous
Spent 20 racks for my brother's appeal and I ain't talkin' no Vicodin
Over 1 mil in this room, bitch, I kinda sound like a Pisces
Lil bitch you know I'm the bomb and 2 Chainz the light, no lightnin'
Wow, these bitches excited, me and Thugger, we 'bout to start up a riot
I ain't got no pussy all week, I'm on that "bitch, suck my dick" diet

[Hook: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
Monica, come home to me, yea come home to me my dear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Teresea, I'm tired of lookin' bae, I'm into you, your rear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
Ain't nothin' special man, I sold it all yester'
Pull in Phipps Plaza in a motherfuckin' Tesla
Ain't no pressure when you got a little extra
Put them beams on your face, have 'em lookin' like freckles
Dammit man, I do not know Tar but I'm  having Xan's
My bitch pussy wet like it's wetting rain
This bitch clap on me while I clap at mans, woah
Got Balenciaga's I ain't even wore yet
Half a pound of gas I ain't smoke yet
Traphouse filled up with Ziploc
Used to give my living room super big locks
In a strip club with some flip-flops
Thought it's the time, baby it's not
Got a lotta windows on my crib, nigga
Bout to put that motherfucker in a tint shop

[Hook: Young Thug + 2 Chainz]
Monica, come home to me, yea come home to me my dear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Teresea, I'm tired of lookin' bae, I'm into you, your rear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
PART 2: Lil Boy[Produced by J Gramm]

[Interlude]
Who killed little boy, who killed little boy?
Rat infested hallways, no escape, no escape
From misery, no way out from that hell

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
I'm bout to give these niggas what they ask for
I used to have to argue with my land lord
Yea, my nickname is Tity Boi
Bitch gotta have at least a handful
All my cribs came with a damn pool
Used to stash work in my camel
Young 6'5" with the handle
If you don't watch Atlanta then you need to turn the channel
See I pull up in this bitch in a Phantom
Front grill looking like it's dancin' (it is)
Put some stacks on your head little boy (lil boy)
Yeah they 'bout to call you the grandson (lil boy)
Pussy nigga gonna need a tampon (lil boy)
Put rifle bullets in a handgun (lil boy)
Keep a bankroll on me, nigga
By the time I eat some bacon I got bands on
All my cars I done put rims on 'em
I done touched down, no end zone
All that bitch do is run her mouth, nigga
On the right but that bitch got a Sprint phone (hello?)
Man she got about 100 acres
Enough yard for me to put a couple Benz's on
And I just pop me a perc
I might fuck that bitch with my Timbs on
(Truuuuuu)



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
3 chainz, owww
Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter ‘bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies; is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’
I bit some matches, then sipped some gas and went, kiss the dragon

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’ bro?
Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the swat is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin’, aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin’ like Kappas stompin’, I’ll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord why you took Rabbit from me, he say don’t ask me nothing
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin’, I heard they stung you
It’s gon’ be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don’t even mumble

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
I’m back to ballin’, I’m in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That’s codeine turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In 4 minutes I’ll turn this into forensics in a foreign car with a foreign broad
That’s long winded, paper long, and you taking long, you just don’t get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like “Hi, officer,”
When he ask me why I was swerving, “I’m high, officer.”

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album

[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy, then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table, then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah

[Verse 8: 2 Chainz]
I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself



[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
My side chick got pregnant by her main dude and I'm offended
I called, she ain't pick up, I text her back, bitch you stingy
I'm in all black like a ninja, chain got influenza
Walk in the traphouse, use my Cartiers for credentials (God damn!)
I'm going wildebeest, all on my enemies
Negative energy, I could do anything, I got the guillotine
Off with they head
Known to pull off and get head
Drippin so much sauce on your bitch look like she wettin' the bed
I could do more than just say it, strip club veteran head uh uh!
I am still gettin' this bread, bought her a Birkin bag uh uh!
Everyone look at the tag, I do the digital dash uh uh!
I can do more than just brag, I can back it up UH UH!

[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs

[Verse 2: Offset]
Blue cheese, no ranch, all hunnids
10 racks on me that's mall money
I just bought a Lamb Ima crawl on it
Get on top, she act a dog with it
I'm on this drink need to slow down
Racks in back it won't slow down
You had a sack but it's gone now
Safari diamond, money long now
Better wake up, smell the coffee
Black man with a lot of money, got the white man wanna off me
You was my mans but you lost me
Poppin xans, I'm exhausted
Cookie smellin like a mosh pit
Pop a perk, kinda nauseous
50 pointer, shit colossus
Hey, With this money I could stay up and survive
We go live, smoke this dope and ride
We too fly, bad bitches in the archive
Oh so high, money make me so high

[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I'm havin blue cheese
And I'ma get it by any means
Flexing on niggas like Hercules
Fucking on bitches with double D's
I met the plug, got 100 keys
Give me that block and I gotta seize
These niggas sick of me, wanna get rid of me
I'm at the top and they under me
I hit the lot and don't ask for the tag
Racks in my pockets, they lookin like kneepads
Flex in my Off Whites with Benjamin Franklin
Put the rest of that blue cheese in the bag
My life I'm livin it fast
One thing I cannot do is go out sad
They know me but don't know my past
And if you know me you know I'm about my cash
The Nawfside, call it Baghdad, make a nigga 40 yard dash
The Nawfside, where the bags at, I was breakin my wrist in the glass (Whippin it!)
Smoking on Barry Bonds in the Huracan, spinning work like I'm Taz
Migos and Chainz in the city, go to your girl car
Had to bring out that bag

[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs

[Bridge: Quavo (2 Chainz)]
When you wake up in the morning
When you wake up in the morning
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
(Uhh, uhh)

[Outro]
Boy, my uncle 12 shawty
I had to take my uncle to school this morning shawty
And he got suspended
'Cause he smelled like weed when he got there



[Intro: The-Dream]
Baby let's roll away
Get lost in the day
I love that you love what you do
And just like any girl, baby I'll love you the same
I know you gotta go, the DJ is calling you to the stage
Go ahead baby, do your thing

[Hook: The-Dream]
Honey complexion
Body of a goddess
22s on the Lexus, named Alexis
By the way of Texas
Big face Rolexes
While she's undressing, man I'm stressing
She's extremely blessed
Extremely blessed

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Give us this day our daily bread
If you a chicken head, go somewhere and lay some eggs
I make you, make your bed, take that head
I got a move that will break your leg, know what I’m talking about
Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out
Our first date was the Waffle House
Different day, different escapades
If they don’t like it they opinions like Escalade's
Everybody got one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeahh
She slow grinded the whole time
I told her have a seat, you sitting on a gold mine
Big ass, long hair, thick thighs
Eat Lobster tail like French Fries
I’m the type to buy you a car for the fifth time
This skinny nigga doing big time
Oh wait, dinner dates I demonstrate how to penetrate
If you ain’t wit it, then its elimi-date

[Hook]

[Outro: The-Dream]
Baby let’s roll away
Get lost in this day
Say it’s okay
Come to me
Extremely blessed



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm gonna cause pandemonium
Pick up the paper, custodian
This how Prince met Apollonia
Tryna fill up California kings
Hydrocodeine with the Visine
Master bedroom on the right wing
This a Philippe not a Breitling
Fuck her to sleep, she had pipe dreams
Yeah, this is the king of the trap
Yeah, I pull it straight out the hat
Yeah, everyone better take cover
Yeah, got rappers under attack
Uh, my daughters inherit arrogance
And they intelligent, that's a fact
Bought me a car February 1st
You already know it was black on black
I cover my scars with the tats on tats
You better back back, rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
I pass you a joint, better pass it back
I went to Montgomery, with packs on back
Sent her to the store for some plastic bags
Sent her to the store for some rubber bands
I started pitching so easy
I throw the work to you underhand
Underworld, underground, underline
I'm underdog and you under mine
This here ain't no once upon a time
This really happened for real
Can't even trust our own government
Aw man fuck all that humble shit
Mumbling
Man fuck all that mumble shit

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Realize
A lot of these niggas tell real lies
They not about shit in real life
And thats something that I had to realize (Realize)
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it
(reco-reco-recogni-i-ize)
They see me winning and now they dont liiike it
(Yeah, I know they dont like it)
Act like the love me, but hate me in pri-i-vate
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I went and copped a ring
I call this rock, Dwayne
Johnson, stop the playin'
Man, I cannot complain
I left my shades in Atlanta so I told my pilot to stop the plane
He bust a U in the air
She say she doin' it, where?
She wanna sit in my chair
But she could never be my heir
Checks, clear, Bible, swear
They ain't buggin', I go off
Asahd Khaled with the cloth
Dwayne Carter of the north
Dwayne Wade in the fourth
New dream house for mommy
Keep 'Caiah in Armani
Putting my nieces through college
This for Kellise and Imani
Look at these niggas I put on
All of these niggas I'm good on
My own two, what I stood on
That's why their necks what I'm keepin' my foot on
I've been winning 8 years consistently, at least respect it
Papoose wrote a Ether record
But I broke Aretha record
See this is chess, not checkers
You can not check the checkers
Did Nas clear that "Ether" record?
Nah, but I broke Aretha record

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Realize
A lot of these niggas tell real lies
They not about shit in real life
And thats something that I had to realize (Realize)
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it
(reco-reco-recogn-i-ize)
They see me winning and now they dont liiike it
(Yeah, I know they dont like it)
Act like the love me, but hate me in pri-i-vate
I had to reco-reco-recogn-i-ize it

He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Okay I’m chillin’ in my camo, flippin’ through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo’s a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I’m pitching
To make your body switch another position
And listen, my weed loud, fuck her and speed off
Tell 'em I bare arms, I'm cuttin my sleeves off
Lettin' my tats show and I sag my pants
Im letting my ass show, I'm hot as tabasco
I study, Castro, yeah, my plug from Cuba
Inside of the car is like a damn computer
Inside of the crib is like a damn museum
You ain't seen these before, you better get 'em on film
Tryin to take these fat pockets, man your chances are slim
Disrespect, you stomp em out, man give em a Tim
You ain't did what I did, see I know I'mma win
And they dont have slow-motion so I did it again
Woah!

Okay I'm sittin' on the plane, flying over graves
I am so high, nigga I can talk to rain
My outfit's insane, ain't that evident?
My chain had another chain like it was pregnant
My favorite dish is turkey lasagna
Even my pajamas designer
She got a fat ass I make her rewind
Back seat so big I press recline
Got a dirty sprite in my cup holder
Rappers like road kill, they get run over
They get done over, it's just one solider
This flow will make you fall like its October
Me and your girl, nigga opposite of sober
Celine Paris chain charm look like a cobra
Young Casanova, Baby Romeo
I got my girl geeked, she look like she from Tokyo

[Hook: D'Banj]

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on exotic, my girl ain't got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I ask her is she working, she ask me do I want it
I say when I went to school bitch money was the subject

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around on my side of town, boxing gloves I beat the trial
I had the coke I had a smile, I had a coat for every style
Crocodile the gator type, I'm allergic to the hater type
I take ya wife, give her back, 9 months after that, SIMILAC!
Similar the saying, mama's baby daddy's maybe
When we had sex I was in a Mercedes
And I ain't crazy, but if that's my baby
Then we gonna have to name the little baby Mercedes
The money that I'm making I don't see you like I'm blind
I'd rather spend money baby I don't spend time
My pockets on full, and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm riding around on my side of town wit' my dubs up and my window down
It's the king homie I'm on one, them suckers know they don't want none
Steady repping that one son, Bankhead, Cedar Hills
I'm on Simpson Road and I'm going over to pick up some dough from in Adamsville
My seat white, my paint tight, spray candy red the same at the wheel
Got a bag of pills in my stash spot, steady whipping them racks out
Got a quarter-mil in my Louis bag if you wanna know what that sack 'bout
Still rep for them have-nots, try me homie you assed out
I got Striver's Row in my denim tag and Akoo shit, new kicks
Supersport on deuces, bumping that Trap Muzik
I'm super-paid, I'm Gucci, 2 cute chicks who do tricks
Stay out of my business, when I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Verse 1]
I wear Versace like it's Nike, you don't like it do you
I bet you feel this bankroll if I bump into you, oh yeah
Chopper bullets flying errywhere, pop pop pop
Got them chopper bullets flying errywhere, uh
.223 chopper clip as long as Stacey Augmon
In the restaurant I order 2 fried lobsters
Napkin on my Balmains, smokin' with lil mama
Like fuck your baby daddy, his daddy should've worn a condom
All these grams on me, all these bands on me
Make her want to dance on me and put her hands on me
Sprinter van on me, I got them Zans on me
Driveway so damn long by the time I leave I'm damn asleep
[Chorus]
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr

[Verse 2]
I done put so many on I can't fall off
Trying to see how much the West End Mall costs, oh yeah
I might buy a Maybach and paint it all gold
Buy a crib fill the rooms up with all stoves
Wish I could tell you what she doing to me
Pocket full of money that's bluer than the sea
I feel like I just paid off the plug
Drop the top off the whip, hair-line receding
High last night so I woke up this evening
Can't pimp me so don't you tip me
Rims on the car make it six feet
So I can park the car wherever the blimps be
I want a bird for my birthday, I drink syrup with no pancakes
Yeah, bitches round my pool, I make them hoe look like my landscape
Yeah, El Chapo J R R, multicolor A.R. rules
Looking like I play ball, tell 'em keep they day jobs

[Hook]
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr

[Intro: Tom Lehrer]
Every evening you will find him around our neighborhood
It's the old dope peddler doing well by doing good
(Shawty get them kids out the street!)

[Hook]
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me

[Verse 1]
I said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
Most of my niggas got gold teeth
Most of my bitches got tattoos
Most of my niggas think cash rules
And I mess up hairdo's like it's a pair of shoes
And I need a parachute when I'm up there
I'm in the trap cuz I work there

[Hook]

[Interlude]
When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow everyone knows
It's the old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he goes
(Let me take my shades off a little (...) See what these bitches looking like!)

[Verse 2]
See what these bitches looking like
Stick in all crooked like
Louie V is my Kryptonite
Take your bitch and I give her back
Give her this and I give her that
Fine wine and lobster tail
Candle light and Chrisette Michele
Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell
Fix her hair then fix her nails
Even pay a few bills
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal
And my whole crew ill
Pockets on Fatburger
Going so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda
Staying focused, this yola here
Black and white ice: polar bear
You hold her hand and I hold her hair
I pull her close and put it there

[Hook]

[Outro: Tom Lehrer]
When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow everyone knows
It's the old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he goes

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Baby I just landed, you gon pick me up
Heard you like to squirt, I might lick it up

And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin
I'm known for crushin', you're known for blushin'
Oh what was that
You blowing kisses, I throw em back, pull into that culdesac
Back then no chauffeur, back seat like a sofa
One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy
No makeup on, you're still pretty lady
And you beautiful, inside and outside
I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife
You call me, I come through
You pass out, I come too
Dippin it like fondue, spinach dip, cheese stick
Appetizers, entrees, it's you in that lingerie
As far as race, you're first place, I'm only in town for one day

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know

Ain't stunting these niggas, ain't stunting these bitches
Two cigarillos, look like extensions
Yeah I’m from the Southside, her mouth wide, my pack loud
My gat loud I back out, and click clack, pow pow
Court dates, skip trial, my rep is a reptile
An hour later, alligators, I stepped on the work like a stepchild
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I’m down, her phone off so don’t dial
This right here is that no style, I don’t know how I do the shit

All year, it’s Gucci season, G's on my belt buckle
Cocaine on my left knuckle, kill you and bury what's left of you

[Chorus]
Damn right I got it, damn right I'm 'bout it
Clique full of killers, please don’t get us excited

[Verse 2]
Pho-to ready my polo out the cleaners
I'm the the perfect definition of something you’ve never seen of
Maserati, Kawasaki, bought my girl a beamer
The jewelry I got on is matchin' with the tequila
Patron, margaritas, double for my divas
I bring all my guns to work, Gilbert Arenas
Plus I'm killin' features and I'm killin' shows
I should have sex in the coffin’ cause I’m killin' these hoes
Fulfilling these goals, climbin' up the ladder
Shoot your ass down you know I rep Atlanta (Southside!)
I'm ridin' around stuntin', smokin' loud in public
Talkin loud in public, yeah my entourage is bucking

[Hook]
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I smoked a blunt for dinner, another blunt for breakfast
2 Chainz, got 'em staring at my necklace
Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix
Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix
She got it, I want it, I want it, she got it
I'm dodging paparazzi, my outfit from Versace
Copy, copy, all these niggas just copy
I just bought me a new watch and these new niggas just watchin'

[Hook: 2 Chainz & Fergie] (x2)
I know you had the time of your life
I know you had the time of your life
You know I'm gettin' money, ten, twenty, thirty, forty
I'll be countin' this shit all night

[Verse 2: Fergie]
When I die, bury me inside the liquor store
Cause when I die, Fergie still gon' be gettin' dough
You do what you can, I do what you can't
You smoke that Bobby B-B-Brown, we on that Shabba Ranks
I got it, you want it, you want it, I got it
My girls go shopping, that ain't a mall, that's my closet
So copy (copy), copy, all these bitches just copy
Honor student wit' double Ds, that ain't the bra, that's my ta-tas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, yeah...
I'm gettin' to the monies, with an apostrophe
Fucked her on a pile of clothes, now she a closet freak
Yeah, I bear arms, I got something up my sleeve
And when she wit' me, she don't wanna leave
She just wanna freak, she don't wanna sleep
Put it in her mouth, now she don't wanna speak
Yeah, I'm at the club, I got strippers at my table
I call doin' a 69 a favor for a favor
From the cradle to the grave
Shoot a nigga from his ankle to his waist
You can tell that I'm paid cause I'm high-class
Fucked a bitch in her eyelashes
We in a jet, who gon' fly past us?
Tint all in my eyeglasses, I don't see ya, hater
And I don't get dropped, bitch, I drop the label
Goddamn!



[Verse 1]
Sometimes I have them thoughts
Like I'm too real for this shit
Labels keep callin'
I need 2 mil for this shit!
Took a mixtape
Turned it to a mansion
Then I took my last pack
And it turned into gymnastics
The crazy thing about it
I been knew I had it
I was being patient
Y'all was being stagnant
The crazy thing about it
I been gettin' money
I been gettin' pussy
Shades cost 600
The crazy thing about it
I don't need nobody
I don't need no co-signer
Talking bout I got 'em
The crazy thing about it
Everything been crazy
My girl cousin died
Now who gon' take care of them babies

[Chorus]
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one

[Verse 2]
This Polo, not Izod
I get dough like Tae Kwon
Asking me what I'm on
I say my bank account is on steroids
Trappin' off my Android
Tryin' not to go fed for it
Cause I'm so high, talkin' I'm so fly
I don't know if I should l land for it
Addicted to codeine
My side effect is a red girl
If I buy the pussy you payin' for it
Put your head through the headboard
I say it but, I don't get no credit for it
Pull up in that short bus
Tell 'em this is Sp. Ed. Tour

[Chorus]
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one
A-Town, we got one
Westside, we got one
Eastside, we got one
Southside, we got one
Got one, I got one
This pistol on me, I got one
This check homie, I got one
Respect homie, I got one



[Verse 1]
They say I run the streets, I tell 'em no wonder
The cheapest thang I got on is my belt and it's 400
Real recognize real and you don't look familiar
If my girl worked at a spa, man she still wouldn't feel ya
Cocaine flow, they done dropped me in the pot
I came out hard and I sold out the block
Tity 2 Chainz, I been killin' hairdos
So many dates on my calendar it looks tattooed
Got my mind on my moolah
My Tech 9 got a cooler
They scratching they medullah
They like how the fuck you do ya
Don't make me number 2 ya
Okay, I need some Charmin
I got swag for sale and I'm giving niggas bargains
Rappers are my target
My flow so retarded
Need a handicap sticker for my 16s when I park 'em
When she in the front I make her put in reverse
And if that pussy good then I'll put it in a verse
And I'm killing these niggas, Put 'em in the dirt
And yeah, I'm killing pussy we should do it in a hearse
I woke up this morning, said I'mma get it
Turned right over and I gave that bitch the business
Hopped out the king size
My friends are green guys
Suit on, it look like I done sold bean pies
Qui-Qui-Quiet storm
I flick my lighter on
2 blunts together like an extension cord

[Chorus]
Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement)
I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement)
All my bitches bad (Thats a understatement)
My car is going really fast (That's a understatement)
Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement)
I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement)
All my bitches bad (Thats a understatement)
My car is going really fast (That's a understatement)

[Verse 2]
You need a standing ovation
If you stand in my location
Every nigga round here done been shot or on probation
It's the life we chose, guns and hoes
Guns and roses, niggas know that rock don't roll
Grab the spray, Drop the phone, Cop the O
Niggas know my flow is Mop 'N Glo
You know where I be on
I be on the styrofoam
Chicka-Chi 1,2 like it was a microphone
Your girl's like a drive thru, I want a combo
And she's so wet I need a towel, pronto
2 Chainz, A.K.A. condo
Cause that's how much these chains cost if you don't know

[Chorus]
Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement)
I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement)
All my bitches bad (Thats a understatement)
My car is going really fast (That's a understatement)
Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement)
I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement)
All my bitches bad (Thats a understatement)
My car is going really fast (That's a understatement)



[Intro]
>What is it?
>Freebase
>What's free about it?

I thought if I said now, “Listen"
"Should I talk about freebase and what it"--or somethin?
And people say, "Well, no, because, then people will start doin' it"
No, let me--I gotta talk about what happened to me

[Bridge]
See where we're from, it's all or nothing
But we take penitentiary chances like it's nothing
We came from nothing, from nothing
Freebase on top of the oven, get money my type of discussion
Ya'll could do this shit for free, a nigga like me gon' be hustlin'
Freebase (x9)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I came from nothing
Me and my niggas, we came from nothing, sold that caine like it’s nothing
Told you from the introduction I came from the pain and suffering
Two pit bulls and a TEC-9, TEC-9 use to jam up on me all the time
Swear to god if you come up in my mama yard
I’mma shoot that motherfucker till it get tired
Big dually truck got six tires, big ties when I rhyme mixtapes
And I keep shitting on the competition, I'm about to put out me out a shit tape
Guess we ain't playin' by no rules, every night I freestyle on Pro Tools
Tell Flex come to the A we'll carjack him by one of them regular ass old schools
I don't respect my elders, these right here Maison Margiela
I cannot get no earrings, it'll make my Rolex jealous
I been a felon since fifteen, my expedition had a big screen
Half you niggas was constipated, half you niggas wasn't shit then
Zone one all the way to zone six, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own shit
Fuck y'all, I'll buy my own whip, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own brick
Tell them pussy niggas that ain't pay shit "Better be ready to let the gat loose"
I done did a song with everybody from Jermaine Dupri down to Papoose

[Hook]
I came from nothing, I came from nothing
I came from nothing, I came from nothing
I came from nothing, I came from nothing

[Verse 2]
Work hard, play hard, work hard again
My bankroll had twins, can you comprehend?
Seafood lover, I don't eat pork
Used to hit them J's like a 3-point, my partner mascot is a pitchfork
And you already know what this for - me too, rent due
Doggin' these hoes like a shih tzu so cold I recorded in a igloo
Nigga asked me why I don't drink, man, let me tell you what the wine do
My partner came in and said "This my girl", I had to tell that motherfucker "Mine too!"
Court dates in the summertime, might pull up in a vert
No matter what the charges is, I'mma pull off with a smirk
This right here for Old Nat, this right here for Godby Road
This right here for Riverdale, trappin' at the Stop-N-Go
Trappin' at the Texaco, it was Amaco before it was BP
My plug from Mexico, he fell out when he seen me on TV
Sold drugs to my loved ones and it's hard for me to admit it
The first time I've seen a crack pipe was in my parents' kitchen

[Hook]



[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turn up
Got the Benz right in front us, all my friends on the come up
I'm like, damn, these niggas ain't a 100
Man I keep that shit a 100, all this bling cost me a 100

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got a recipe for my destiny, southside niggas to the left of me
Southside niggas to the right of me, southside niggas to the death of me
On Ecstasy, you couldn't fuck with me, gettin' money is my specialty
Got the game on lock, and I got a mothafuckin' extra key
Excellence is my pedigree, buy a car and seem petty to her
Then I paint the feet, call that shit a pedicure
Niggas on the road ain't gettin' no money, that's a petty tour
I can fuck your bitch, and act like I never knew her
She the shit, I'm manure, I'm a good pussy connoisseur
Keep it on the low, so sometimes I get pussy on the floor
I'm on top, so look down below, told y'all I'm 'bout to blow
I'm 'bout the dough, I count the dough, I cash out, then I'm out the door

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up

[Verse 3: Cap 1]
I walked in, then I turn up
Then I set up on they muthafuckin' couch, roll the weed with a burner
Got a bad bitch, and I make her hold my liquor
She got her girl with her, she don't know that I've been hittin' her
Red bottom shoes with the spikes all on it
Pockets full of 100s, make all the bitches all want me
I be movin' through the city, 100 niggas comin' with me
On the road of riches, it was some bitches takin' pictures
Roll a 3-5, put together two Swishers
Movin' like a box, fuck around and get your issue
Man I'm pourin' up lean, got me drinkin' out the pitcher
Walkin' in, amd I'm so sag coolin'
Trueys on, they gotta fuck with my movement
Southside Duffle Bag, nigga we boomin'
Look at how I do it it, tell that I'm gettin' it
Plug on the way, I told that nigga 20 minutes
Ridin' real wheel through the city, nigga, pimpin'
First I go the Fifths, then I'm headed up to Lenox
Spendin' big bags, man I'm runnin' through a check
Work just in, got a pack in the jack
Show you how to move, niggas talkin' finesse
Probably cuff one, then I'm offin' the rest (Gone!)

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up



[Intro]
I told them, get on my level
Bitch, you could get on this shovel
Coke prices high, than which was if a Tony Montana
I just got me a bezel
My slippers is clean
All I wear Tru Religion
I paid a grip for them jeans
I got a lust for the cream
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, but it ain't nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

[Verse 1]
I say I'm incredible, most legible
Schedule ain't, but I can make your girl flexible, edible
Put her top and call it putting her on my pedestal
You would never know, unless you worked at the bank
Camel toe, look like steak
And your boy look like great
2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane
You can tell your girl here, because a cab came
And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change
Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune
Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune
And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction

[Hook]
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

[Verse 2]
Yo it's my time to shine, so I'm checking my Rollie
A bet with the Lakers, I bought a necklace off Kobe
I be fucking your girl, I was texting her only
I told her, "I'd like your legs better if they was open"
Ever since the beginning, niggas knew I was focused
Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers
I'm a fucking example of a fucking example
Hit her from the back, nigga, that's a fucking example
I came up on Luke Campbell, I'm so sick I need Campbells
If you know I'm showing up, I hope you come with your camera
Got the city on swole with my Louis bandana
My car is shitting on niggas, I should ride with a Pamper

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I give you something to see when you are looking this way
If you approaching with the drama, then we approach with the K
And when you look in my eyes all you see is the pain
On medication, I can drink 200 a day
When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A
It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30
With my ice on early, in all gold knight sterling
Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman
Take a girl, it'll start spoiling
Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling

[Hook]

[Outro]
I say it's my time to get it, my time to shine
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind
It's my time to get it, my time to shine
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind, bitch



[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I got extra, I got extra
I got money, I got work
Far as hoes, I got a plethora

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I get money, 12 gauge shotty
I don't like nothing but hoes and tattoos on my body, yeah
I got extras, you want some?
Fucked your girl on accident, that's a hit-and-run
Heaven's sake, it's been a hell of a day
I pray for all my niggas with a federal case, damn
Okay

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
Southside, I got all this
Snake skin on my hat, albino
I'm rich, like Lionel, I get head like rhino
I'm ridin' on my rivals, survival, bible
Rifle, bullets, for y'all niggas!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I just went on the run, 100 piece for a show
I just had a threesome for three weeks in a row, yeah
Last name Chainz, first name 2
I'm T.R.U. to it, you know how I do it
I get head 'fore I screw it, first thing I do
Yeah, you know I'm stuntin' cause I'm gettin' to the money
Put it in her tummy, pu-put it in her tummy
Hit her with the morning dick, ooh, I ain't pissed yet
Yeah, I rep the A, the only thing I flunk is piss tests

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
Okay, I'm rich, like Homie
I got yo bitch, from my homie, 2 Chainz, what it do?
In the living room, full of that paper
Used to have a little room, now that's a house and an acre
My partner in the kitchen room, and he fucking with the bakin'
Chopper lift ya to the moon, nigga, fuck y'all thinking?
If I get her in the room, she gon' suck my babies
Tryna work her moves, tryna trap me with a baby
If you owe me money then, real soon, you better pay me
Me and 2 Chainz just like shoe strings, strapped like laces
Ay, and I'm too clean, riding in a car from the 80s
Rich Homie, no new team, boy, I'm a star like Macy's
Boy, I thank god I made it, got a couple broads in Decatur
I'm in the fast lane driving in the car, going crazy
And I got your main dame, yeah, the one you call your lady
First million dollars, most important thing: saving
And if you wanna book me, hit my agent
I got eight pounds in a old car
On old Nat in front of skate town on the

2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feeling me, feeling you...
Everything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz

[Verse 1]
Breaking up with my ex was the hard part
Had to pull the ass out like the gar-bage
Bout to take this new thang to a pinnacle
You feel me, feeling you I ma-ssage your physical
Thank God... I'm spiritual
She ask me what I'm finna do I say get into you
One leg up followed by the other
Get a little head then I find a rubber
We don't talk on the phone - we Tiger text
That mean she send a few flicks and I send a check
You 'memba Shonda, the one that had a Honda
Good head on her, you can learn a lot from her

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In the a.m. I think about her fragrance
When she met me I made her change all her statements
Not what she say... but what she bank
And how she think... I can't complain
On to the next one pro-gression
Keep the past and the present, separate
I got alotta spots like a leopard
One to trap in, one to have sex in
One to stack in, one to get dressed in
I'm getting married Ben Franklin my best man
3 cell phones she got all the numbers
I told her right then it was all or nothing
Yeah I'm on that loud I know you heard of me
Hair-weave killer, emergency
Hair-weave killer, I murder weaves
Hair-weave killer, murder scene

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money machine at the bank, I just made me a deposit
Fucked that bitch right on the sink
Is it the pussy or is it the faucet?
I just left the hotel, never let ho in mi casa
All this designer shit it's like a crib in my closet
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
Man, all this fuckin' gear it's like a crib in my closet
My Nike shoebox filled with rubber bands
That mean my Nike shoebox is my ATM
Fuck it, I said it, I'm winning, downsouth MC Ren
I might buy some Timbs, or peanut butter MCM
Raised down the street from a crack house
Pull her hair weave 'til the track out
Treat the rap game like a trap game
Tryna make a yellow ho tap out
I got Dolce, I ain't even worn yet, codeine ain't even po' yet
I could spend millions of dollars, and still won't even be poor yet
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking poet, riding now, motherfucker Ol'Nat
A nigga wearing a Versace shirt, man that's a motherfucking throwback

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet

All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib
All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib in my closet man
All designer shit, all designer shit, I got a crib in my closet, bitch

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Since rappin' turn to fashion, I don't know what happen
Or mishappens, matching turned to swagging
He exposed the world to trappin'
Picture posin' tactics
Hold this that click click, finna' blow this backwards
Money, hoes and fabrics
Scrolling past like ''fuck yo photo caption''
If ye ain't got it then you bragging, that's automatic
I see no need for me to Tweet, these bitches know my status
I'm the shit, all designer shit, got all kinds of shit
Got Prada around from 1999 and shit, bet you won't find the shit
I’m on my Anna shit, that’s Wintour
It’s dressed like it’s Met Ball
I’m in Vogue, this winter, the runway, no insta
Got a crib in my closet, Spanish chick in my casa
So much space in my closet, fit your crib in my closet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I got more sneakers than niggas, over 4000 pairs
Most all white like the Rhode Island mayor
Got a crib in my closet, hustle every day, nigga
If you work with them people, I’m unavailable, nigga
You smell like pork in a Mecca, Lord be my protector
Second row at the fight, bitch get on my level
Larry Merchant my nigga, I got Holyfield money
Finger your girl at Coachella, gotta roll in that for me
You should see me in Lennox, I shop ‘til I drop
Spent so much on the watch, had a seizure and shock
Wake up and ball, watch how I walk
Money all on my mind, call 'em lucrative thoughts

[Hook]



[Intro]
Last night I fucked a supermodel
Got head on the way home
She left her other friends at the club
Got home, and I fucked her with my J's on

[Hook]
And that's ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh
(Woah bring it back)

[Verse 1]
Take your bitch like I'm the dog catcher
Take your ass to the mall after
Spa day, shawty
Kill that pussy, pallbearer
You from that RuPaul era
I'm from that hell nah era
Real niggas say tru
Real niggas ain't you
I ride around with that yapper on me
Gun clad with my Glock up on me
Surround your ass with so many shots
You'll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish
My paper up, got your girl with her ankles up
Gangster boy

[Bridge]
She got her T-shirt and her panties on
She trying to smell my cologne
I can fuck her anywhere I want
I even fuck her on the floor

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm on top like a toupée
You on the side like a toothache
Box your ass, suitcase
I'm real, you ain't
Calamari, crab cakes
My closet the size of your dad's place
You lookin' at a star
I wish that they could add space
I'm getting money, fast pace
My hoes gay and my cash straight
He can't ball, he castrate
She the opposite of last place
Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin
My girl got a big ass
Your girl got back pockets touching

[Bridge]
I want it all, I want everything
Balls out, I let 'em hang
Window shopping for a wedding ring
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you pat your weave that's ratchet
My last album was classic
Shawty on my dica
Backwards spells acid
She pop a P like a zany
She'll use no hands and no panties
She rock like nose candy
You fuck with me, ain't no plan B
I'm a D boy with a degree
I sold dope in my momma's home
My girl pussy deep deep
So right there is my comfort zone
Born alone, die alone
Mud in my styrofoam
She got on top of me like a stage
I said use my dick as a microphone



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Here I go, here I go this that C5
Bitch I’m back, with that crack like panty lines
Asinine, I get blow like dandelions
Fuck more hoes than advertised
They say Tune you’re dead wrong
I say wrong, had to die
Pussy nigga don’t keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed but the high stay the same
Prices go up but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
Chillin’ in the crib with the lock on the door
Layin’ on the couch with the Glock on the floor
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach
I just cut off the lights, hope I don’t shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp, I smoke so much hemp
The world too small it feel like 4 walls
You see I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin, but I still took ‘em and nigga we made it
T roll that killer, weed up in the swisher, and make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin, they cry for help we get ‘em a hanky
Ain’t nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin’, the bitches we bangin’, the cinnamon danish
The penalty's pending, shit is restraining
It is a shame but niggas is shameless
Niggas is assholes, or enemas, finna get anal
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out
But still I’m maintaining
Real gangsta shit it get dangerous
You talking money and guns, 2 languages
I throw niggas from off of the plane I’m in
Oh my god, it’s raining men
Said the weatherman to the anchorman
I send hella cash to the bank I’m with
What you do it for if it ain’t for this
I watch my step so much, I’m starting to feel like my ankles’ wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I smell like money, dope man cologne
I say bitch I smell like money, that’s that dope man cologne
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause bitch I smell like money, I smell like money
When you this rich they call it wealthy
Shit they gotta call it somethin’
Lord I done got too rich for stuntin’ (damn)
But not for thuggin.’
That’s right bitch I smell like money, money
You smell me coming

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
Totin’ double barrels in a horse and carriage
Ain’t scared of nothing except God and marriage
Through the concrete grew a rose petal
If trapping was a sport, I’d have a gold medal
I steal her like Jerome Bettis
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus
He ain’t never fly nigga, like an ostrich
They say ain’t nothing for free, but please free my partnas
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yea, lobster rolls for an appetizer
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer
I’m in my Rolls Royce because it’s black and wiser
And don’t get in the way, my nig this rapid fire
Brrr stick ‘em, I’m a victim of being a victim
Codeines, Xanax and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with 2 sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I don’t never call and you miss her
I got every gun except a missile
I paid attention to the minister
My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn’t walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune 2 loose screws
2 parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn’t even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo T and ice watch, moccasins without socks
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I say bitch I smell like money, that’s that dope and cologne
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause bitch I smell like money



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Good head get your rent paid
Then I cut a corner like a switch blade
Bitch made nigga talking shit 'bout me
Got a red car so I bought a red bottom
Chillin' at the game sitting courtside
You looking at the flyest nigga on the boat ride
Low life, I'm a multi nigga fo' life
Oh my, had it up to here like a bow tie
Cut it out, sold drugs out my momma's house
So for mothers' day, I bought my mom a house
Chillin' in the club standing on the couch
Nigga, fuck yo couch, nigga, nigga, fuck yo' couch!
Shoes cost more than that shit anyway
Any day, when the semi spray, bet it penetrate
Brrraaatt, better duck, nigga!
Got a lake in my yard filled with dope, nigga!

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I'm just livin' baby, and you got that right
I'm just livin' baby, I'mma enjoy this night
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Motherfuck the other side, (motherfuck the other side)
Motherfuck the other side, (motherfuck the other side)
Everything official, my pistol's dismissin' missiles
As far as running game, my nigga, I need a whistle
My nigga, I need your sister, oops, I don't think that came out
Still fuck a girl with my chain out
Still do my thing with my thing out
Long ass clip, I could shoot you without aiming
My life, your motherfuckin' entertainment
Dangerous, leave you with the angels
Shoot yo' ass from all types of angles, explain this
Well, it was just bunch of niggas and then just me
They came close and it just skeet
They tried to run and I said "Come back"
If you think you're alone then there Bobby Womack
Hold that, ridin' that Phantom down Old Nat
Nigga said "What up, pimp? Where the hoes at?"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Ride around on my side of town, you might fuck around and get peeled
I rock Mookee, rock Y3, got Bathing Apes on my heels
Nigga, this ain't no game, there ain't no competition
I knew he was a fake, got good intuition
23 and I'm still livin'
Been all around the world and it's still Richmond
Cause I'm loyal to my soil, good to my hood like oil
Got me in that water, bet it boil
Bitch, I'm a boy, beat the beat up like Roy
Consider your bitch my employ', real to the core
Straight up, I never been fraud, and I put that on my lord
Y'all rap 'bout clothes that you cannot afford
Where's the Versace and where's the Tom Ford?
Everything we rap 'bout, that shit be ours
This bitch a freak, she should get the award, aye

[Hook]

At the strip club, two girls in front of me
Bend over hut one, hut two, hut three
Polo on my drawers, Polo on my shirt
Polo on your bra bitch, that Polo, Polo, Polo
Every time you see me takin' photo after photo
At the red light nigga photo after photo
Stretch to impress, snow on my chest

Woah kemosabe, smokin' is my hobby
Woah kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
Woah kemosabe, I'm met her in the lobby
Then I took her to my room and I got that sloppy toppy
No matter what I'm doing, no matter where I'm going
I am so far ahead I'll see you niggas in the morning
Two chains on my first chain started cloning
If I die tonight I got a bank roll on me
Versace, cheese on my broccoli
Gold rollie on all you watchin' all my watches

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
(My mama always said)
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules
(My mama always said, ayy, damn)
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm from the hood and it's evident
Used to sell drugs out my residence
Stayed in section 8 with relatives
Opportunity knockin', I let 'em in
I done put Forgis on everything
I left the mall like Ginobili
And if I'm not successful, ain't nobody gon' come console me
I pray my mama quit smokin'
When my dad died, I got focused
I gotta table full of Ace of Spades
I don't fuck around with you jokers (ooh)
Ain't heard a word from my old friends
Heard they wanna kick my doors in
I done loaded up the 2-2-3
I'm so high they might call a goaltend, yeah
Lord knows, stashed work in the console
So many autos in my garage, I can't open my car door
Bond on me like the sun on me
Gettin' this bread she say, "You dropped crumbs on me"
Walked in the club and got ones only
Need a tat on my stomach that say prawns only
Raised by single parent Black woman
They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me
She always told me

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
(My mama always said)
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules
(My mama always said, ayy, damn)
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Smoking on a yacht, call me Ricky Steamboat
Bags full of gas, used to serve them through the screen door
Tryna flip a brick, Shaq at the free throw
Taught by Scarface, Brad Jordan, Al Pacino, wooo
No rules, most of my partnas homeschooled
Most of my partnas got charges
And I ain't talking about no mothafuckin' dodges
Trappin' up outta the college
I'm addicted to the rice at Benihana
Raised by a single parent Black woman
They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me
She always told me

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
(Yeah)
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules
(My mama always said, ayy, damn)
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules



[Intro]

(Go get my shit)
Young Money, we care

[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
If it wasn’t for Wayne, it wouldn’t be
A lot of dudes in the game, including me
We was smoking that gas in ’03
Was gon’ sell a few bags to Lil Fee
Couple years removed from HBs
Tatted lyrics from Jigga to Jay-Z
I went to Eastover before Katrina
Remember going to Magic riding in my Beamer
And this was way before FEMA, and you was rappin’ and singin’
And I was slanging the Ps and smoking nigga like Newport
Comin up off of Too Short, my underwear was my hoop shorts
And then I went on tour and recorded songs on your tour bus
And that was ’08, that’s the first time I met Drake
When I hit your cup with that drank, had a nigga stomach like wait

[Hook]
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
Yea, that my dog, that my dog uhh
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dio, yea that my dog..........

[Verse 2]
You relocated to MIA
You told me shawdy this where I stay
I came down to pay a visit
You told me Zoe Pound and them was trippin'
And you, you wasn’t dippin’
Had the M-16 and with the extra clip, ready to act ignorant
Ridin’ off in the Phantom, and Mr. G he was driving
Pumpin’ that Playaz Circle, you told me that we was riding
And I told you that I was rappin’, I told you I wasn’t writing
You said Luda was foolish because he wasn’t excited
That was way before Tyga, I saw Nicki with Gucci
You said, “You can make a million rappin’ ‘bout some pussy, I did.”
T, Fuke, Mally Mal, shining like Armor Oil
You can ask Mack, I was YM ‘fore all of y’all
Stunna said I reminded him of Johnny
In this world you either selling or you buying

[Hook]
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
Yea, that my dog, that my dog uhh
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, yea that my dog..........

[Verse 3]
You tatted your face and changed the culture
You screamed soowoo and them gangstas loved it
You bought a Bugatti so you can flex
And most of the bad bitches your ex
Ride ‘til the wheels fall off and they got wobbly
Duffle Bag video, we shot that bitch on Godby
You was holding a sty-ry, I had more gold than a pirate
They said it ain’t about stylin’, what they tryin’ to kick knowledge
Duffle Bag Boys, yea I can’t forget Dolla
In going to get the money, it’s some words that I follow
I swallow my pride, smoking endo outside
Straight from Collegrove, I’m reporting live

[Hook]
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
Yea, that my dog, that my dog uhh
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, yea that my dog........

[Spoken Outro]



[Hook: 2 chainz]
I ain't gotta fuck yo bitch, I got my own girl
I ain't gotta smoke your weed, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta drink your drink, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta pop your pills, I got my own drugs

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
I walk in the party with my own drugs

[Verse 1 : 2 Chainz]
While you stressin' me, God keeps on blessing me
I know how to make money, this the recipe
Your pussy get rest to peace, especially murder scene
Hit her from the back, she like, "Hercules! Hercules!" (tell 'em)
Started from a pot, then I took over the spot
Then I took over the block, then I took over hip-hop
Then I started geekin', then I started tweekin'
Then I started reachin', then I stop speakin'
Finished Monday, started on the weekend
Gas in my car, I got gas in my 'gar
You can smell it when I'm passing your car
Its the last of the raw, all you need is a straw
And when I ain't feelin good, all I need is a mall, showin' off, uh
Your pockets on doughnuts (yeah)
Got my posse out in broad day
Been up all night, its been a long day
Im trying to get higher, fucking up my fung shui

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Styrofoam cups got flying spirt
Double cup full of Ms. Buttersworth
Brownskin bitch in a tennis skirt
With some rolling papers, full of purp
Couple of bad hoes in a penthouse suite
Ya'll broke niggas ain't in my league
I swear this game been good to me
Im a veteran in this game, why would I leave?
Real niggas, thats all I see, Pimp C, R.I.P
I'm up all night, like "Fuck some sleep"
Push start button, like "Fuck the key"
Your boy's too broke, can't fuck with me
My hoes too fine, can't fuck for free
Ya'll niggas out here savin' hoes
I'mma start calling you niggas "Justice League"

[Verse 3: Cap1]
I'm on codeine, I'ma dope fiend
Got Molly world for that party girl
Ecstasy, she want the best of me
Turn her out, she a naughty girl
Your bitch choose my girl, like
I ain't gotta speak my wife, get her
Lickin' on me like an Optimo
Get a boy a Sprite and now pour a pitcher
450 for a zip of strong, codename: gas money
Magic City, cuttin' up, bitch shakin' their ass for me
Fuck the bitch in my back seat

And every stand I'm for me, I'm gone

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
You a wuda cuda shuda ass nigga, ol' wuda cuda shuda ass nigga (x4)

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
I woulda went there with y'all, I woulda got me a rental
I coulda stunt in the club, I could fuck every ho in the building
I shoulda got me a plaque, I should get me more attention
No, you should shut the fuck up and leave all the bitchin' to bitches
(Wuda cuda shuda ass nigga, ol' wuda, cuda)
(Wuda cuda shuda ass nigga, ol' ol', ol')

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
She in stilettos, she walkin’ all pigeon toed
Really though, when it come to gettin’ dough
If you listen to me, I’m so underground
You have to sit on the floor, oh!
I just thought I’d seen a spaceship, ride right past my airline
Everybody know I dumps that white girl like Kevin Federline
Don’t pay me no nevermind
These niggas is buggin’, pesticide
I count money in my spare time
Just paid a hundred dollars for a hairline
Label talkin’ bout what they woulda did
Bet they hustle me and you could be a winner
Girl, you eat more pussy than me
Girl, you shoulda been a nigga
Pockets swellin' up like Lymph nodes
Been a go-getter from the get go
Always talkin' bout what you was finna do
Damn broad, thought that you were finna get dough!

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
You a wuda, cuda, shuda ass hater
Wanna be a man so bad homie
Ain't wanna see me get free
If you could you would have caught the stand on me
If I would have shook your hand, I would have been your boy
Now you extra hot since I dun' hit your broad
Now you talkin' now, 'bout sparkin' now
You prolly would shoot somethin' if you had some heart
That Bentley come from exotic rentals
Gotta go back Sunday, so you flat broke Monday
Probably could go spend 200 on somethin'
If you was gettin' Boosie money
You in King of Diamonds throwin' counterfeit
You might as well gon' pussy pop on the stage
All these rappers lyin' on records
O-M-G Hip-Hop, Hooray!
And you probably woulda been up in my video
But that was 'fore I went in
Ain't even write me no letter
You a wuda, shuda, cuda ass friend, busta!

[Hook + Bridge]



[Verse 1: Sunni Patterson]
And when you spiral through the atmosphere, all they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy, humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Or something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod, I recall
So many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said it, "The best thing you can do and be is you"
"This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due"
Ain't that the truth? And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Free at last, free at last, that's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate, sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucet
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade

[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve
I practiced repetition, I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze
Dad kept this in the dungarees
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this, underscore, it's just me and dope
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me

[Hook]



[Intro]
It's that moon rock shit
You gotta mix this with some
Regular OG

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Cum in a bitch and I go crazy
Spend all these racks and I go crazy
Leave out the parking lot doin' a 180
This how the lord made me
Drop the top and start sun bathing
Put her on a treadmill and then I make her run naked
Got all my side hoes frustrated
This the life I waited on
Seen a bitch from school, gave her number to a payphone
I don't know what you been waiting on
All that I know is that I been waiting long
I ain't waiting to get no lone
Provolone on top of provolone
Mobile phone on top of mobile phone
I don't know what you niggas smokin' on
Pull my closet got a upstairs

I start my car with remote control
Get so much pussy

Ridin' round in a old school, with 2 hoes and little old me
Fuck I'ma do wit this money
But walk in the club and start stuntin'
Push all my old bitches buttons
Came up from nothin' to something
Tell her take the stick, don't run from me
There's some for you, there's some for me
So if we have this 3 some, make sure you cum for me
All that bullshit is up under me
Smokin' gas ain't no tumble weed
All of this cash that's another thing
Black and yellow like a bumblebee (bumblebee)

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Fuck it, I want me a billi

Every time I take a shot I'm tryna make it count
And if she get sad I might buy a bag
And if she get mad I might buy a jag
Put a ring around it I can't wait to make her down
Glad we had a little girl so it can trickle down
Woke up this morning I feel good as fuck
If your girl wit me you know she good as fuck
And I can't even lie that pussy good as fuck
First I pick her up then take her home and pick her up

Counting blue hundreds and smoking an onion

Okay, from grams to Grammys
Okay, from fans to family
I went from trips we tryna plan
To cribs in South Miami
They got my vision fancy
My trigger finger antsy
I told the bitch she got to sit down
Just to understand me
They asking, "What's the plan, B?"
I don't have a Plan B
I told 'em this shit got to work
It's just like candy to me
I mean it's hard but it's sweet

You say we gon' drink ,we gon' drink
You say you want drugs, we want drugs

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Big dually parked in my driveway
Hanging out that motherfucker sideways
Residue in my fingernail, make every day like Friday
This how we do it on the southside
Bumpin' Trapaveli on the car ride
Bad booty shots got you lopsided
I buy a new car if my car die
Solid gold Jesus, two of 'em
Backseat I'ma call it futon
Ride around in motherfucker uwop
Like who-a-who-a-who-a-who-a
Bought a bad bitch, I got a crew of 'em
It's four fur coats, I got a zoo of 'em
It's thug life, niggas I don't fool with 'em
I don't care if I went to school with 'em
Come out that thing like yeet
Everybody with me, nigga D
Everybody with me, nigga D
Everybody with me nigga eat
Black ink all on my body
I pray a body don't get on my shotty
I pray nobody don't get in my way nigga
A to the motherfucking K nigga
Start spittin' lyrical bullets
Don't be surprised if I pull it
Don't be surprised if I shoot it
We the type to pick on a bully
We the type to ride in foreigns
We the type to ride on Forgis
Pinky ring look like a smoothie
Flame goin' up on a Tuesday

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Big thing parked in the driveway

Powder on my hands, King James on 'em
I walk around this bitch with my chest out

Man look at who I done became on 'em
Niggas look who and I went switch lanes on 'em
All my niggas brainless, need brain donors
We movin' birds, gettin' birds, shit stains on 'em
Man fuck these niggas, I don't know these niggas
From Jumpstreet it's been M-O-B nigga
It's M-O-B since my D-O-B nigga
And since my D-O-B I've been on my J-O-B nigga
I shoot a nigga ass like Ginobili nigga
I kick a nigga ass like Shinobi nigga
I give your bitch dick like Moby nigga
She know the words to my songs, karaoke winner
Smokey Robinson couldn't out smoke me nigga

Cause you on that bullshit and you nosy nigga
You on that bullshit ain't ya?
I'm back on my bullshit, gangster
I'm back up to full strength, gangster
Pat-pat at the pulpit, gangster, amen
And I still root for the underdog
And you the pile of shit under the underdog
These niggas ain't eatin' like a Ramadan
I shoot the driver in the head, make 'em honk the horn
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)
Got big booty bitches in their under-alls
And they pussy gettin' wetter than a thunderstorm
And I swear when I'm in them panty hose
I'm like a kid in the candy store
But I got this bright red bandana though
Flingin' it like I'm a matador

[Hook: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]

[Intro]
Y'all niggas lame for that, y'all niggas lame for that
Shoot a man in his back, should be ashamed of that
Young niggas banging back, young nigga banging back
Then we gon' fade to black then we gon' fade to black

[Verse 1]
I left the crib walking, drove a Mercedes back
You wasn't blessed with ambition so who you gon blame for that
Tried to get off the Act, still didn't know how to act
Still pull up in the back, sit my ass right in the back
Tell my driver when he open my door to take off his hat
Double saran everything so that you know its a wrap
Double salute anybody that made it out the trap
Some of y'all probably still owe me from back
In the back in the back in the back in the back
I had that work right in front of me fuck all you niggas you wannabes
Most of you niggas is under mes, I'ma give ya ass some to see
My car don't have car keys, my crib got palm trees
Pussy smell like sardine you, need to get up of my lawn please
This a real nigga conversation, real nigga demonstration real niggas
No Cristal or Hilfigers, a bunch of ignorant lil' niggas
A bunch of red young tenders, dark skin queens, Puerto Rican princess's
Scratch my hand my palms itching, hit the dope start twitching
This a new kinda kitchen, marble countertops, see through fridge
3 thousand for the microwave, touchscreen stove lil biiiiitch!!
Please don't make me relapse, make me start back trappin
Everybody in the city, saying that boy Tity done started back snapping

[Chorus]
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Tell her let's go have a bite, tell her let's go have a bite
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah

[Verse 2]
I sat in the trap no one cooked at night, I treat my third strike like its Kryptonite
I stopped serving sacks over qualified, have you ever seen a homicide?
Have you ever seen ya partna die? Have you ever been traumatized
Even at graduation i had a bookbag full of yams, tryna multiply
Enough of the negative actions, I got my paycheck off passion
I'm wearing 4 bracelets for fashion, don't think its a race when I pass you
Stop talking that mafia shit, you never met Meech, J-bo or Illz
Luda charged me just to dip, was there when Chaka was swung on by Tip
I'm like oh shit we goon tear up this bitch, pull out a stick when u put up your fist
I'm like these niggas done fucked up my fit, funny how heaven and hell co exist
Funny how life can put you in the mix, I sold the pounds and go hustle the bricks
I booked studio with the trap money, Lil Wayne used to come get the bags from me
You still asking niggas for gas money, I look at these rappers like crash dummies
I look at these bitches that fuck with these rappers like bitch you just fucked with my last homie
Kesha can come get the last from me, Heaven can come get the last from me
Harmony can come get the last from me, Halo can come get the last from me MAMA!

[Chorus]
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Tell her let's go have a bite, tell her let's go have a bite
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Ok I'm stunting on you hoes, denim True Religion
9-1-1 I'd like to report my ceiling missing
They tried to take my swag, I got condoms in my condominium
What you know about that, I'm balling like leukemia
Horsepower told the Porsche giddy-up
Stunt so hard somebody call the media
And I'm a star my neighbor is a meteor
I'm off in Neiman's 'bout to buy a Fendi fur
Sent my girl to the store for some rubber bands
Them niggas over me didn't understand
If I say it then I did it then I fucking meant it
All I do is stunt, bitch I'm 'bout to pop a wheelie!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
All I do is stunt (stunt), stunt, I get anything I want
Started in the back now I'm that nigga in the front
Shout out to Rozay, nigga look at what you done
All this shit I spit so sick, and my pockets got the mumps
And my neck it be so cold, boy my money old
And my Presi' glow, everybody know
I'm a, perc popping, Polo drawers rocking
Bad bitch getting muthafucka I'm a problem
Yeah it's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around in my city wit' the top down in my Bentley
And my windows up, nigga what, going hard and I don't give a fuck
Put mirror tint all on that bitch so when niggas hate they see theyself

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Listen up, fuck niggas
Let em' know I'm still up in this bitch poppin'
Do so many shows in arenas, my nigga, I need me a locker
Look at my car, how did it get on them sixes?
This flow come from Drizzy
He got it from Migos, they got it from Three 6
Look at my bitches, look at my wristses
Realest nigga in the game, my nigga, ain't no counterfeited
Bitches is thick and delicious, doing they dishes
100 million on my wishlist
Taking penitentiary chances, just to drink lean in them Benzes

[Verse 2]
I want my trap back, I said I want my trap back
I'm from apartments
Used to walk around with work in my backpack
G's all on that shit, G's all in that bitch
12 calling me by my government
Running shit, gunning, she shopping in London and loving it

[Interlude]
- I, oh, okay, I think we've had enough... here
- Shush up for one second. You shu-shu-shut. Shut your mouth
- I needed someone to move the--
- Wait, shut your mouth. Shu-shut your--shut your mouth
- I'm sorry. What did you just say?
- You're just coming off stupid
- I'm coming off as stupid? You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms. Please leave this office, we're done with this interview
- Do we get any sort of souvenir?
- GET OUT OF MY OFFICE!

[Verse 3]
I want my trap back, I said I want my trap back
They sayin' that money talk, nigga
So you already know that I want my cash back
You niggas ain't talking about shit, Harley Levin
You would've thought that there was some
Kilos on my bus but they didn't find a thing
Hair, man, like Brillo, my flow Armadillo
Catch me first class on Delta with Versace all in my pillow
I been seen a kilo, the dope man my hero
Remember I had that Box Chevy? I set that bitch on some P zeros
You know that I'm rocking Buscemis, and I'm as raw as sashimi
Her head is so cold, my nigga, I think that she gon' need a beanie
Rolling and smoking zucchini, dropping the top on the whips
Making them look like bikinis
I am now balling so hard, I should be on my own boxes of Wheaties, ugh



[Intro]

[Hook]
I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one, ooh
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one

[Verse 1]

2 Chainz:
Broken home, tell me what the fuck is wrong
Now I gotta charge a brick for a song
Trap guy, turned into a rap guy
No suit on but I still got trap ties
Argyles, pastels and some neckties
Shawty on the pill, X-file
40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised
And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs
Mamacita baby, this is kamasutra
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future
As far as the past, nevermind that
I don't know who's finer, you or this wine glass
And you must rewind that if you don't get it
Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what I'm eatin
My chromosomes read Georgia Dome
Icy watch, I don't mind spending time alone

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Jadakiss:
Yo, get the clip out of the ashtray, put it in the air
Grab my cellphone, call my engineer
Yea, last night I was on one
Quick carwash, then I make a mall run
I'm a different brother
Louie store spending chips on some kicks I already got, different color
40 cally chrome, on deck
Gotta meet with my connect later on down in Malecone

All the Kush gone, gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone
Weed man coming with a half a zip
30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick
Always hustle to get it
I never ask for shit
If it's family or money I might have to flip
I'mma say it if it's on my mind
I like to take it one day at a time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

2 Chainz:
Never on the guest list
Always unexpected
In so many checks
I should make a checklist
Looking at these emcees' like they should make a deathwish
Got my girl in the kitchen, cooking ambidextrious
Left wrist, right wrist
Whip that, white bitch
This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to write this
Look at my Hublot, watch how the light hit
Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit
I done did it all, except die nigga
Too dehydrated to cry nigga
I was struggling, had a time limit
I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it
I wish that pussy had a sign in it
That said,"Warning: If you hit it then you mine nigga"
Damn, that crazy bitch on that crazy shit
If you don't make money it don't make sense

[Hook]



[Hook] (x2)
I'm like a quarterback, watch me hand it off
Drop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball
I done seen 'em ball, I done seen 'em fall
Rest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg
You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg (x4)

[Verse 1]
You the realest, ain't no gimmicks, I got illness
If this rap game is my building, I got tenants, I got tenants
I got "gettin' it" in my spirit
I'm winning to the end, and I just made me some millions
And this only the beginning
Rest in peace to all my niggas, they died while they was servin'
Rest in peace to all the soldiers that died in the service
I dive in her cervix
Chicken's, no churches
Never seen a man cry 'til you seen a man die: closed curtain
Closed casket, blasted, breathe again, Braxton
Heart filled with passion, neck filled with matches
Nonchalant and sarcastic, my bank roll gigantic
School of hard knocks
I am the man on this campus

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can't explain it, how I'm getting to the payments
Rest in peace to my nigga, God bless all his babies
And he gettin' so much money, I know this shit sound crazy
But he coulda retired and he was born in the 80's
And my hair look I'm from Haiti
Haters say I act funny
I'm on my baby, I'm about my cash money
I'm tryna get meals like I'm past hungry
Got two or three "Rest In Peace" tats on me
What's really real? Just left the dealership
Pull your girl off my car, that's that whip appeal
I'm 'bout to milk the game, Enfamil
Hit the girl with my two's, Benadryl

[Hook]

Done it, done it, done it man I'm runnin' up
Tity Boi 'bout to fuck the summer up

I'ma poster child for the hustle
You a poser child for them bustas
Game up for grabs, I'ma take it
Try to stay down like the pavement
Live by the code, keep it true
Anything and everything to get a loot
Nigga think they trill but I'm triller
Nigga think they ill but I'm iller
Nigga think they big but I'm larger
Pussy you ain't nothin' but a target
Smokin' on joints, gettin' massages
Keep dodgin' me and I charge up

Pull up on your set just to send em through
Shittin' on them niggas like an enema
Fuck the bitch, had to say I'm into her
Nigga know I know I been winnin'
Niggas I know I know I don't give any fucks
Sold my Monte Carlo, bought a Cadillac
Sold my Cadillac and went and got a Beamer
I used to put my drawls in the cleaners
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena
Spend a lil money you can't take it with ya
They said the feds out here takin' pictures

Hashtag making bands, yes I am

Used to stashing work off in a inner tube in middle school

Turn one to ten that's what I tend to do
It's an amber alert I gotta missing roof I
It was black and it was travelling fast
I love you now I dont care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes, matching bags

If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back got a bad bitch with me
Told her hop in back my car speak she dark meat
I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth Velourz hoodie

Graduated from high school and bought a choppa
Orville Redenbacher bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl, Cindy Lauper

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
When they saw me they used to think of dope
But now when they see me they just think of hope
Inspiration no infiltration
Them niggas hatin I got they bitches naked
Hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn
If I was sellin swag man I woulda sold a ton
Designer sneaks leather seats
They say money talk thats why you never speak
Every verse I do is a rest in peace
Wish this highway to heaven had an extra seat rap game extra sweet
Big ass charm conversation peice

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Million off rap but the trap was sweeter
When dealings on the block all prices cheaper
I been doing this since guess and fila
They say my entourage each car four deep eight heaters
Drop the middle man to cut the cost
They say my whole click cut from a different cloth
And of course we pay the cost, with each block that we off
You take off and call back it ain't our fault that ya lost ya lil bitch
Ask ya boy bout them forty he lost talk slick Glock
Forty ya boss now you the president
Fresher than peppermint
Whip tint till six bond number nine flow wall street bidness bitch

[Hook] (x2)
Started from the bottom now we at the top graduated from high school and bought a choppa Orville Redenbacher bitch we got it poppin on the block with that white girl cindy lauper

Drumma boy (Drumma boy)

I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my motherfuckin word nigga
That's my word

[2 Chainz]
Niggas know I call my Porsche the baby elephant
You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment
Everything I got, I got from selling shit
And who I sold it to is irrelevant
Pocket full of Dead Presidents I'm good with whatever
I pull my dick out and tell her sit where ever
I done stood on the block nigga from 9 to 9
And I done sold a 9 at least 9 times
9 Milla, clientele Look Like Thriller
If my baby mama cheating I Hope God with her
You not iller I'm Godzilla on hard liquor
My Penny loafers had nickels... UGH

[Hook:]
I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds

[Young Jeezy]
I'm slangin Chickens, I'm slangin Hawks
I take the 4 up out of the brick bitch I can write in chalk
You know I know that white and green like a chalk board
What you doing? Just chillin look like the top board
So many chickens in the kitchen it looks like a soup
Must be some owls in this bitch, cause I keep hearing "hoo"
This for my niggas cooking 9s like they chicken breasts
You know we trynna hide the six that's why the chickens dressed
I had the Lam Black and green like a Parakeet
No, I ain't tripping, put the pigeons in the Cherokee
Everything a nigga got, I got from slanging birds
What I ain't get from slanging blocks I got from slanging words
Snow

[Hook:]

[Yo Gotti:]
I got a car, that bitch a classic
White on red, inside out that bitch nasty
When I pull up on them sixes, speakers blastin
Black scale white work clear plastic
And everything I got I got from selling birds
Half a brick to do a verse, I guess I am selling words
That dubbed it up
Niggas send me dranks so they double the cup
Got two chains on, bitch I'm icey as fuck
2 brains on my arm that's a 100 and up
We sell dope it ain't nothing to us
New whip, new bitch, nigga change for what?
And where I come from niggas bang for none
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for some
Drinkin soda bakin soda I'm yammin up
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up
My niggas grinding we banding up
These pussies know not to be playing with us
Work

[Birdman:]
My bad bitch, my money long
Car game filthy and my game strong
The kitchen hot
My block rock
My neighborhood shot cus them cars hot
Nigga on some money shit
Got back on that other shit
Came with the fame nigga listen while you learn bitch
Money is for show shit
Gettin it while we blow this bitch
All the time we are gonna show where we are flowing bitch
100 thousand on the watch
Living lavish off top
Neighborhood watch
Cocaine flocks
The coke game strong
Overseas phone
Nigga made it home
So we gettin it on

[Hook:]



[Intro: John Legend]
My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark
I was whippin' it hard
I was gettin' the broads that like "who the hell is that"
I Was dealing sacks
You Looking at a Nigga That Drove To Hell And Back
Charismatic I was raised by an addict with money in the attic
Got goons while you at it at this present time
I'm out of my mind and that's a habit
Still Got Them Waiting In Line They Gotta Have

[Hook: John Legend]
Last Night Was The First Night I Got Sleep
Tossing And Turning For Two Or Three Weeks
My Nightmares Are Triggered By Bad Memories
Lord, Send Me An Angel Right Now While I'm Having Ghetto Dreams

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Cold sweats listenin' to the old sweat
One, two that's a ho check
Now for real, nigga this a whole check
Just bossin' around, polo sweats
Used to dream about a bigger couch
Woke up in a bigger house, c'mon
Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scarface]
It's like the world stand still
Yesterday your little man got killed
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young kuz the game cold
Most niggas ain't know or they just think slow
Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil
To the point down your ass when he see you
Let's take that needle, fill it with poison
Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
Ain't no honor among thieves,  is there nowadays?
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so
Because every criminal I know is in the clink, yo
A nigga in the game right now
Must be working for them people cause that shit played out

[Outro: John Legend]
I lay awake in my four corner room with the candles



[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Beautiful... Pain

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you
Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do
Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead
By the time you get there
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga

[Hook: Lloyd]
Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Shamon.. hm-mmm
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so now we syrup sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains
What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working
But now the companies are merging
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service
I'm too young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up

[Interlude: Ma$e]
You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you don't gotta say much

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Life is a game of inches
Every move leads to something better
There is no time to play the benches
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever

[Interlude x5]
I'll be the man or I rather die

[Bridge + Hook]



[Intro]

Formulate a plot, conversate with Glocks
Bang bang motherfucker this is gun talk

Yves St. Laurent spring collect wear, yeah
And I've been on my paper route
A lot of zeros in my motherfuckin' bank account

[Hook]
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good

Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good

[Verse 2]

Powder on my chest, diamonds on my neck

In the T top with her knees cocked
I'm so motherfuckin' high nigga tree top

[Hook]
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good

Got my car, no keys but

If you see smoke, that's our section
If you see ho's, that's our selection
At the strip club during a recession

[Hook]
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good

Niggas wanna know how I get it when I get
Don't worry, Just know it's murder

[Hook]

[Kreayshawn Verse 3]
This right here is murderous

But my mind still climbs for greater-ness
That money that I'm playing with
Put a whole in your head with no blame for it
Saying it

Come back to the block and I'm spraying it
Delaying, I'm stopping it
Put a end to your life, I'm blocking it
Your career bitch, you was never on

Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout the doe

Hello.....

Mama only child we stayed in a one bedroom (tru)
Used to ride MARTA ‘cause it had more leg room
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan
First lick I made, I bought five pairs of Jordans
Make it so bad, two pair were the same
I see the old me in new cats in the game
Drop some loose change on some clothes I can't pronounce
Gun so muhfuckin' big you gotta crouch
I like pretty girls with some business about theyself
Bring your best friend, you don't need nobody else
All about that mula, Netflix, and the Moscato
In my sex drive, I ride over potholes

Tell that pussy nigga I pull up
Used to sell work to his aunt, he ain't push weight
Nigga did pull ups
By the time ya look up, nigga done cook up
When you turn away, a nigga done took her
Got her in the suite, looking like a hooker
Jumpin' on the bed like Jimmy "Fly" Snuka
I take her to the mall and I pocketbook her
You tryna' spend time, nigga probably book her
Yeah, I'm tryna' fuck her, fuck her like I used to
I don't believe in karma, but I believe in Kama Sutra
Put one leg on the other leg
Then I skate away like Winnipeg
And I'm through fucking with these lame niggas

Got a lotta shooters in my repertoire
Got a dope spot called Escobar
Member when I used to play basketball
Now I'm out here playing ratchet ball, ooo!

[Chorus: The Trap Choir & Quavo]
Good drank, big knots
Good stuff, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)
Drop top, no hot box

She said the love give her thizz face
Put that thing in her rib cage
Whips out, Kunta Kinte
Diamonds clear like Bombay
Take your babies, no Harambe
Play with keys like Doc Dre
3K like André
And your girl, tell her come here

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your trunk in the front
Well check this out my top in the trunk
You play with my money
Then check this out you’re poppin' the trunk
Three mil in a month
But I just did three years on a bunk
Oh, you in a slump
I'm headed to Oakland like Kevin Da Runt
What is your point?
Square with the stamp, fuck Kevin Durant
Lay on my trap
Play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat
I'm taking the cheese and killing the rats
Gucci Mane, call me the cat with the racks
I'm swervin', but I'm in back of the 'Bach
Persian, man I got hoes from Iraq
I'm servin', I pay a bird for that
He nervous, I ain't got no word for that
He hurt and want all of his purses back
He mixing the syrup with the Percocets
She perfect and she got perky breasts
I just want some of that turkey neck
Trapper of the year, I'm from Bouldercrest
You snitch of the year cause you told the best

[Chorus: The Trap Choir & Quavo]
Good drank, big knots
Good stuff, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)
Drop top, no hot box

Kinda hard to get with me
Can't believe it like Ripley
Pretty girls like trap music

Started off in the basement
Ended up on the top floor
Yeah, you listening to the top flow
Now you looking at the top tier
From grams to the Grammys

All about it, all about it, I’ll tell you all about it, all about it

[Hook]
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
This the shit you play nigga (yessir). This the shit you play (alright)
This the shit you play when you cuttin’ up that work
This the shit you play when you ridin’ in a vert
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Stunt, dab, thrab. Racks
Ball hog, Neiman’s, Saks
Lenox, Moda, dope, soda
Lean, soda, cream, soda
Shawty thick, small waist
Fat ass, gon’ shake
Money tall, Tyra Banks
We everything y’all ain’t
Couldn’t believe in Santa Claus ‘cause I ain’t have no chimney
Soufside with a F and the F for Fendi
I’m the type of guy to buy a extra Bentley
Had two SS’s like Mississippi
One phone call and I can get some pussy
One phone call, I know you niggas pussy
This the shit you play when you in the bushes
This the shit you play when you hit the bookie

[Hook]
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
This that shit you play, ‘bout that pistol play
Bop-bop fix your face, haha in your face
This that shit you know, bitch you know you fake
This that clique you hate, but this that here to stay
This that shit you play, this that clique you know
‘Bout that trigger play, trigger finger roll
But this ain’t NBA, this the CEO
And this ain’t MMA, but this a TKO
Rolls Royce Wraith, I park that bitch and skate
I talk that shit, she caught that line, I call that fish filet
And all of my niggas is A1, and y’all lil niggas look like steak (well done)
And all my woes is athletic, and none of my hoes is getting pregnant
Don’t dab, don’t dance
Do me, own swag
Leather soft, you niggas softer
What’s that smell? Rigor mortis
South Beach, socks off
Money, drugs in the sock drawer
Fuck her good, get a round of applause
This the shit I play when I go to drop a bitch off

[Hook]
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup



[Intro]
It's at least 100 degrees, sweating like a fool
Aiight, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Young Juice, ayy, ayy, okay, okay
By any means I gotta get it
You can sleep when you die, point blank, period
No excuse for this, you only get one life
You only get once chance
You can get more wives
You can get more ice, you can get more cars
Nigga listen to what I'm saying, I'm a real superstar, woo

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah I got too many watches on my arm
I got too much shit goin' on
I got your favorite stripper on my phone
I got a bank account, got another bank account
Got another bank account, to be continued
Hibachi my menu, my bracelet on igloo
Every song is a single, you hear how the money talk
I may be bilingual, I pour out a liter, I light up the reefer
I'm back to charging niggas 100 a feature, yeah

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hard work beats talent
Dope boy meets Khaled
Don P and eat salad
Walking around, my feet Bally
Sisquo and St. Ives
Six guns, eight knives
Potato on the barrel of it
Make you niggas hate fries
Been poppin' wheelies since 14
Sleeping with them, in them since 14
Ready to take one for the team
Ain't no discount, if ain't the one, we got a miscount
I am the truth, lil' nigga, shooting bullets from the booth, lil' nigga
BOOM

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You too concerned with others
This for the single mothers
Might have a millionaire
Moving through Riverdale
Jacket on Rick Flair
Watch on Rick Flair
James Brown with the slick hair
Watch how she dance on it, dance on the work
If the pussy squirt, put her name in a verse
I am so high, I'm scared to jump
Keep the gas on me, I'm prepared to pump, alright

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah



[Intro]
Sunbathing with a Rollie on, tan all on my tattoos
All my 16s cashews, V12 when I pass you
Reminiscing about the Motorollas
Weed stronger than a Coca-Cola
Wait up, bitch, hold up, hold up
You ain't there to hold the pole up

[Chorus]
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
My partna just died, my partna just died
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout to pour out some liquor
I'm 'bout to pour out some lean
I got blue cheese in my jeans
I bought my queen Celine
I got my team Supreme
It ain't no in between
You either in or you out, I took a different route
I had to figure it out, I went to picking them out, you, you

[Refrain]
Fuck what you think, fuck what you think
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house

[Verse 2]
Presidential prolly tickled, laughing 'bout who popped the pistol
That's the issue, just got a rental, just for instrumentals
I'ma keep the bitch 'til December
And park it on Broadway, away from the hallway
Away from the 'partments, away from the arcades
We don't play games with them boys
We bring the pain to them boys
I caught a plane with them boys
I taught the game to them boys
I am ashamed of them boys
Blame it on fame, blame it on whatever you wanna blame
I'm smart and insane, imagine a genius that don't have a brain
That live off of resources, that learned off of geek sources
I do play with 3 persons, I got it from researching
I'm fresher than detergent, I'm fresher than each person
I walk out and eat Church's, gig without rehearsing
Watch how I resurface, watch how I rework it, gas

[Chorus]
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
My partna just died, my partna just died
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck

[Refrain]
Fuck what you think, fuck what you think
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house

[Verse 3]
Yeah, your favorite rapper's got no talent
Homeboy got coke habits
Used to drive a Porsche 'til I found out it was made by Volkswagen
This here is a toe tag 'em, Tity Boi gon' and toe tag 'em
Go ahead, hook they ass up to the tow truck
Let them know this a throat slashing
Your baby mama got no passion
Her best friend act old fashioned
Tell her take them panties off when she walk around my boat laughing
I'm V.I.P. at the yacht club, nigga you look like you not loved
Stars in my double R so clean I drive in white gloves
Sea bass with the white sauce, hopped out, get wiped off
Presence been felt everywhere
Except let me see, yeah the White House
Space age like 8 ball, MJG, Nate Dogg
Sippin' quavo, ridin' offsets, guess I'm 'bout to take off

[Chorus]
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
My partna just died, my partna just died
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck

[Refrain]
Fuck what you think, fuck what you think
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house



[Intro]
Realest nigga in it, already know
Got trapper of the year 4 times in a row
Realest nigga in it, already know
Got trapper of the year 4 times in a row

[Chorus]
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Trap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check

[Verse 1]
Rap shit check, trap shit check
Cashier check, fashion check
Foreign car check, foreign bitch check
Rolex check, gold around my neck
Juju on the diamond, my umbrella’s designer
Stand on your recliner, pourin’ all the wine up
Yea I used to pitch, you should see my wind up
Nigga fuck with me ain’t no telling where you wind up
It’s all love, positive vibes
Walking through the airport in crocodile slides
Wet floor signs, hands on thighs
If you got a check put your hands up high

[Chorus]
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Trap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check

[Verse 2]
Come on, come on, come on
I rock the microphone, I had to thank the Lord
I am in rare form, I had to get it on
You never feed me, I use my own seasoning
Autograph cleavage, how many girls believe you?
How many girls you tried, I know a girl you lied to
She wants your ass to die, I look you dead in your eye
It’s real nigga season, it’s right after Easter
Might buy me a Regal, put that on my Visa
I need me some singles, don’t care if you’re single
Take you and mingle, take you to Neiman’s
We hit the bars tonight, look at the roof on the Wraith
It look like the stars at night, yeah

[Chorus]
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Trap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check

I don't have to front

Make me a profit a month
Whether I get it or don't
I'ma go hard, I'ma stunt
I'm puttin' gas in the joint
I'm puttin' oil in the blunt
I do this shit for the Park
I do this shit for the Point
I do this shit for the 'Vard
I do this shit cause you boring
I am the man in this muthafucka
I got them bandz in this muthafucka
You know what I'm sayin', hand full of Xans
Nigga not playin' in this muthafucka
Put me a deuce in a Brisk tea
Couple of chains on the Crims tee
Tell me how I met a bitch one time and she talkin' 'bout she miss me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She fell in love with the Percocet
She like the one with a ten on it
She like the Benz with the fins on it
She like the Benz with the lens on it
She like the Benz with the rims on it
And my turbo got them twins on 'em
All of my partners got bandz on 'em
So tell me what the fuck you sayin' huh?
You exotic baby, you special
Go and send me some nude pictures
You so fine, it's a damn crime, you gon' end up on a news special
You exotic baby, I'm fuckin' with you
You exotic baby, I'm workin' with you
And I'm smokin' on exotic
Got Chanel on her body
Might meet her in the lobby, used the herb in my ashtray
"Give a fuck" is my last name, "I don't" is my first
This for my ones, like November first
Walk around with two cups, like I'm always thirsty

[Hook]
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited

Ain't none of your hoes, none of your hoes
Ain't none of your hoes, none of your hoes
None of your hoes, none of your hoes
None of your hoes, none of your hoes
They can't get in, they can't get in
Yeah, It's a real nigga party
It's a real bitches party
See that vibe right here, you dig?

[Outro]
Thousand dollar shoes on your sofa
My other trap nigga watchin' Oprah
My other trap nigga watchin' Ricki Lake
I'm a trap nigga servin' shake and bake
I'm a trap nigga, serve you shake and bake
We in the back of the bando
Ammo like "Commando"
Pit bark in the front yard
Ain't no key for the top part
I'm allergic to cop cars
All these F's on my rims, fuck report cards
Reporting live straight from College Park



[Intro/Outro]
I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like, "Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!"
Boom, boom, boom

[Verse 1]
My shoes sold out in one day
Pull out the blueprint, bumpin' dat Gunplay
In a Maybach, pockets stay fat
So fly, I could parallel park on a fucking runway
Going down a one way the wrong way, shoot barrel long range
Swag like pro ball, gave her a ring, phone call
Money talk, pole vault, walked in, drove off
So comfortable at the dealership, I don't take my robe off
I wake up and I get to it, breakfast time I might sea food it
Lunch time I might lamb chop it
And you do is talk shit like you was eatin' booty
Southside in my bloodstream, smokin' on that propane
I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains
All white with no stains, I been trappin' fore the Grammy nods
I been countin' money so long I'mma need a damn hand massage
So many cars, I can barely park
So many cars, I need another damn garage
I'm famous with my fam around, damn I wish I had my dad around
Gave a nigga a Lamborghini, so that's a motherfuckin' lamb-me-down

[Hook]
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama

Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer

Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')

[Verse 2]
Aye, European style my dresscode, gunshots in the club echo
Walk around with a .36 with six shots in my .38 Special
Black car, black Timbs, Bank of America back then
She tryna tell me her life story and all I want is a lap dance
Good times, smokin' J's, rockin' J's, I'm the rap Ernie Barnes
If I paint a canvas it'd be melee, firearms
Viacom, maricón, if she bad I invite her home
Buying chains like I'm buyin' homes
Rims taller than Kevin Hart, Ride Along
Them rhinestones, you ain't shinin', nigga
I ain't hidin' so you ain't gotta find me, nigga
All my clothes are designer, nigga
And my back seat recliner nigga
Came in rockin' all gold and I'm fuckin' all yall hoes
Smokin' on that Lee Haney, sippin' on that hard-boiled
This that get back - click clack, get back
Smokin' on Raw paper, this ain't zig zags
Snakeskin wallpaper, rose gold chandelier
I'm lookin' for a baby eater, can I get a volunteer?

[Hook]
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)

[Outro/Intro]
I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like "Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!"
Boom, boom, boom

You already know what I'm mad at
I'm wearin' Hermes as a habit
And I got that hat and the rabbit
So now that we got it established
Who want a gunfight?
Slung it from left right
Back on my bullshit, it ain't nothin' nice
Ain't sacrifice, went Saks twice
That's how I feel, young nigga, yoooooung
Okay, I'm back... where they at?
Yo, Skooly, my nigga
What we gon' do on these niggas?
Rockin' Medusa on niggas
Quality tru
My cousin coolin', meant to say... my bousin boolin'
Goat had them units, Goat had that cookie

See I wanna rub on it, I miss that pussy
And I'll beat that pussy, friendly reminder
Don't let me find you, I creep up behind you
I give you the Heimlich, you think it's the Heimlich
Then I'ma G5 it, just switched the climate
And this is Bvlgari, and no I'm not sorry
I'ma get married at Benihana's, have the reception at Follie's

[Hook]
I told her ounces back

[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Some individuals look at the accomplishments of other individuals and allow themselves to become jealous. Everybody know what it take. Everybody don't do what it take, I don't get tired

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Sometimes you grind from the bottom, get your chips straight
Sometimes you can make a million off a mixtape
Sometimes you get to the top and then your family hate
Don't give a damn what them haters say
I feel like I'm 'posed to be ballin'
Supposed to be winnin', yeah [?]
I feel like I'm 'posed to be ballin'
No one gave me shit, yeah
I feel like, I feel like I'm

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I did a song with Kevin
Way 'fore ya'll followed him on his Instagram
Did a song with Young Dolph
'Fore ya'll even know what Memphis had
I intend to smash, no pen and pad
Married to the game, no strings attached
Married to the game, got a season pass
You wasn't here, but don't even pass
From Decatur to Tifton, I make love with a mink on
I'm top floor, you need a key just to get off of
Need a key just to get off of
Need a key just to get off of
Hanging rappers on a chop board
Outline 'em in chalk Lord, thoughts so
Trap nigga on a pop tour
Break dancing on cardboard
Wrist workin' that Pyrex
In the bando with that Mossberg
50 shots with my nigga Jonny
Somebody stole the truck from Benihanas
Next day he bought a new one
Like you win some and you lose some

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Sometimes you grind from the bottom, get your chips straight

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I'm supposed to be ballin', 'posed to be winnin'
I spent thousands on linens and this is just the beginnin'
I bought my momma a crib before I got my own place
Picked my pop up from prison and gave 'em places to stay
See I am handpicked by God, I defied all the odds
I need a sign that say foreigns only in my garage
You know I'm vicious and hungry, my competition is phony
I'm on my way, cowabunga, to all my cousins, I love ya
I work hard for this shit, I got sleep deprivation
My momma tellin' me, boy you needa take a vacation
I got one in the air, another one in rotation
And when they ask me where I'm at, I say the trap my location yeah

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
When I dropped Trapevelli, I stayed in 3 star 'telis
With 2 time felons, one time I was bailin'
Every Tom, Dick, and Helen
They would act like they was reppin'
Who was real? Who was fake?
It was hard to keep it separate
And my bankroll big, this big, need Excedrin
And excessive marijuana in my motherfuckin' prison
We would wrap it like a present
We would act it like the preset
You was actin' like a peasant
I hold an eagle in the desert
With the Rollie and the bezel
I was fuckin' with the bastards
Yeah I am so slick, bitch you better hit your hazards
And I bought a Versace plate just to eat my salad
And I can count money til I get a fuckin' callous

[Hook: Kevin Gates]

She come through this bitch with Chanel on her pumps
Apples in back of the trunk
You know I flex if I want
We gon' bust stops on the highway
I got my hands on her thighs
I play with her pussy and listen to Sade
Told her to bring it here shawty
Told her to drop it there shawty
I'm from the belly of the beast
Remember I barely used to eat
Now that my weed is so loud you can hear it down the street
Pull up 10 cars deep, you can't get rich off sleep

Had sex in a few places
Bedroom, living room
Bathroom, kid's room and the basement
Straight shot, no chaser
You'll always be my lil baby
Wanna know how your day been
Can't wait to go bare skin
Stretch you out by the bear rug
Give you hugs by the fireplace
Going down like the fire escape
Estate with the iron gates
All the diamonds got a ping on 'em
Living life like a king don't I
Walk around with your dream on me
Never front on your team homie
They say sex a weapon
Shit mine got a beam on it
My spinach got cream on it
Ty Dolla go on and sing on it

In a fantasy world, I'd wife that

Got pulled over on the way home
Used to make juugs off the payphone
Left mama's crib with a thousand Nikes
Niggas know I had a thousand wifeys
Hood nigga, had a thousand vices
Hit Benihanas for a thousand rices
Garlic butter with the yum yum
You know the south side where I come from
Hit the dealership with a lump sum

With some pom poms, that's Don Juan
Don Julio, trap house needs cuticles
Trap house need a studio

[Verse 1]
Believe in yourself, health is wealth
Gotta get mine, faster than a step
I can make a hundred thousand just sitting by the steps
I can count a hundred thousand with my feet in the chair
I can pull the baddest broad in here
With my hand pulled behind my back
One hand on the steering wheel
2 Chainz with the ponytail, got the bodyguard concealed
Ill meaning of sickness, I use the pharmacy as a witness
I mean anything around me that's against us, they can't be
I got God on my side, that's all I need to ride
See that's all I need to vibe, asking what I do tonight
That's really none of your business, unless you wanna get in this

Big ring and a charm to match
Ya my role model was Project Pat
Life is too short, nigga born to mac

[Hook]
Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe

Marijuana in the joint
Codeine in a Styrofoam, that's getting to the point

Addicted to the money smokin' loud from my prescription

Photos of me posin' like Jodeci, poetry

Forty deep forty day forty nights
Sippin' dirty sprite
Married to the game that's my prototype

[Intro: Louis Farrakhan & Monica]
As I met 2 Chainz a few minutes ago, as I gazed into his face, I felt that I was in the presence of royalty. There's a certain power presence that he gives off
I tried to be, everything you want and need

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
'Cause you got a deep title don't mean that you deep
Substance shallow on shit creek, I heard Cole speak
About the bricks, Kendrick got Compton lit
And I've been lit ever since I sold nicks
Never fabricated about my fabric, the scale, that's my apparatus
I give a fuck about the sorriest rappers
This actually happened, path in the back pathogenic
Moved that blow out like we were afrocentric
I had a front row entry, I had the codeine kidney
I made up the Bentiaga truck, you owe me a Bentley
This the rap Ken Griffey, got at least 10 with me
Got at least 10 on me, I'm anti-phony
My girl anti-bony and she get that money
I bought all this shit, don't go acting anti on me
It's Mr. Epps in the bank, I give a F what you think
I bought a Tesla today, there's nothing left in your tank
I did everything except a fucking song with Jay
But I murdered every song I fucking did with Ye
See my verses are better and my subject is realer
See my mom was an addict and my dad was the dealer
And their son is that nigga, I'm no Black activist
I'm a Black millionaire, give you my Black ass to kiss
We used the tree for a fence, I used to land in the trench
Used to dust myself off, then I eat me some shrimp
Coulda did anything, I coulda been me a pimp
I coulda went to the league, I took it straight to the rim
I took it straight to the block, I got Xans in my sock
I got plans for the pot, I got bands, you do not, huh

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, you a miracle. Right now, if you hear this, you're a miracle, I want you to know that. If you're able to hear this right now, you are a miracle. Straight up, no kapp

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I'm more Gucci than Vans, give you a Gucci advance
This the chance of your life, you ain't prepared for your life
See the man without a mic is just a mic gimmick
Anyone, Jordan, Jackson, Tyson, Bivens
Phone number unlisted
Gave her the digits to a number that is long distance
She on the wrong mission and got my palm itching
I had it on me, you can see it in my prom pictures, ugh

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
I'm telling you, niggas like me fall out the sky. You don't just bump into me. I'm a real blessing, bro, nah, for real, bro

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
You know the times is rough, you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors, so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, yeah, okay
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, Lord

[Bridge: Monica]
Lord knows
Woke up today, gave thanks
Grateful to see another day, then the storm came
As the night falls, I shed my blood, sweat and tears
Let the rain fall, let it fall, let it fall
One day
Your love will take me right over the stars, Lord knows

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
That soulful trap music, man. Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Section 8, I'm talkin' 'bout the 'partments. You stay in the middle, someone stay on top of you, someone stay below you. What you know about grabbing a broom and shit and hitting upstairs like, "Y'all stop fucking stomping! Y'all stop walking so mothafuckin' hard!" Then the people downstairs, they doing the same shit to us. Tru, trill shit



[Hook: T-Pain]
Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby
Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don’t do what I do, then who’s gon put food on the table?
It is what it is, I’m just handling biz
But I do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Mama don’t work, heater don’t work
Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it
I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”
He asked me when the last time I smoke, I said a while ago
Forgive me officer, I’m stressin’ and my pockets sore
Hurtin’, chillin’ with my dog like a fuckin’ Labrador
He said he ain’t with the bull: matador
Looked at the top of my car, like what this ladder for?
I told him I was puttin’ goals up in the mornin’
And I’m goin’ to my uncle’s house to see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down, and I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle’s house
Well it really wasn’t my uncle, it was a junkie’s house
He got a badass niece with a donkey now
Pullin’ out the parking lot, headed to the other spot
Out all night, at it with the addicts, causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy
Niggas know we Mobbin’ Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
The good die young, and promises are hard to keep
I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week
The girl that I’m with is like a young Kimora Lee
I got them folks feenin’, pumpin’ that Jodeci
Sippin’ and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Conduct disorderly, stayin’ in the trap house
Trips went to work, I’m so glad that it mapped out

[Hook: T-Pain]

___________

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Simon says, monkey see monkey do
I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too
See me with my bitch, you buy your bitch the same purse
Shoot you and your nigga, y’all can share the same hearse
This that murder 1, mixed with the bubblegum
Kept working my dun dun duns, come get your mama some
Nigga, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums
I rarely finish the end of my words
Watch the rims hit on the curve
And what a nigga really care about a lisp?
People arguin’ over me while I’m layin’ in a bitch
Death to a snitch, get it while you can [break] and shit
Its 3:30 in the A.M
We’re just gettin’ started like when I had the van
Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a Glad bag
You know I’m gettin’ mines, you should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses
Just killed the pussy, you gon’ have to use forensics
Organized crime, you could put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads, I’ll pay a hundred for the line up

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Appetite for destruction, and I don’t need a menu
So far ahead of y’all niggas, I can see you in my rearview
See you in my rearview, one of your headlights out nigga
I just got my first R&B bitch and got head all night with her
She said she tired of the generic
I say what up, she say what up, what up, you a parrot?
I’m like “Bird ass girl, aren’t you sick of the rhetoric?”
And, if I ain’t arrogant, I’m out of my element, ugh



[Verse 1]
I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
Every since huffy, pockets on husky
Shawty don't trust me, I break hearts often
If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher
From a dishwasher to a kingpin
Remember how the scene end and how this thing is
Drugs backed in 'em mean them things in
Now it's duffle bags full of green men
I swear I ain't lying if my daddy hadn't died
He’d tell ya I had em' hooked like Kareem did
Two kids later, I mature like fine wine in the basement
Vino, different kind of pinot
Tried to stack c-note after c-note
I'm tryna make it count like a free throw at the free throw
Line, it's a thin one between
Getting high and committing crimes
Let a nigga live
I've been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick
(Fuck this shit)

[Verse 2]
I remember when I believed in me
What am I supposed to do?
Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me
They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put 'em in a fucking hearse or two
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Kesha's name
In Jesus's name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay
And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh

[Verse 3]
I heard my little big cousin mad at me
I call him little big cause he younger than me
But he big, he was the high school team captain
Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen
And whatever happen that was the worst day
And who know what was going on in the first place
I love and helped raise my nigga
This year forgot to call him on his birthday
It's hard to explain my new lifestyle
A partner lockdown, got a phone and an iPod
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga, it's March
We had similar stars
But I ain't figured his part
They had dough and we didn't
How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer
This is the outroduction
Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture



[Intro]

No panties with the skirt
Nigga try to take the work
Nigga get your ass blown
Get your ass gunned down
Ridin' here 100 rounds
Don't make me have to flashback, nigga, and go buy 100 pounds

Felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’

[Verse 1]
Been havin' that happy hour
Presidential Rolex, I declare
I don’t care what they doing over there
Wrap my dreads in a ponytail
I thumb through the cash right in front of folks
AK on the yacht, that’s my banana boat
South Florida for the winter, I got sunburn
Half you niggas was some suckers in the lunchroom
I don’t care about the tats on your face
Them bitches cost 15 dollars
I don’t care about the pills that you take
Them bitches cost 15 dollars
I’m a rich nigga, I take rich drugs
Smoking gas and drinking lean in the strip club
Got too many kids to play with you niggas
I’m lost for words, nothing to say to you niggas
I got a Maybach, a Chevelle, a Drophead
A Wraith, a Audi, Infinity
Got a tour bus that’s long as a fucking centipede
Got a Panamera, a duely and a sling
Cappin’, I’m cappin’, I’m cappin’, I’m cappin’
I put it in your face like a motherfucking napkin
Got me a Sprinter just to play the fucking game in
At nighttime I turn that bitch to the Days Inn
Two crosses on and they looking like “Ay man”
They looking at me like I’m paid man
It’s nothing much that I can say man
‘Cause my actions speak louder than my fragrance

[Hook]
Felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
I felt like cappin’
Felt like cappin’



[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Uh, what happened, what happened?, what happened?, what happened?
Yeah, damn, girl, what happened?
What happened? What happened?
What happened? What happened?
I thought you weren't fucking with me no more
Damn, girl, what happened?, what happened?
I thought you wasn't fucking with me no more
What happened?
What happened?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She said ''oh, you got that comeback'', she said my dick is a necessity
Drop my drawers, and pull out my longevity
She just hop on it, and then she forget everything
Oh she so open, who’s obsessed with me, when she leave me, she come back like she ain’t never leave
She talk bad about my new bitch, cause we got chemistry
She said ''it ain't jealousy'', allegedly
I thought you weren’t fucking with me no more
Girl, what happened?, you act like you don’t miss me , oh my god you suck at acting
I am like I thought you don’t fuck with me no more, girl I’m laughing
She said, she get real, when that vibrator out of batteries
She be talking about how she moving on with her life, she tired of my shit and she can do better
She told herself; she ain’t fucking with me no more
She lied to herself, she'll lie to who whatever
Talking about, she seen me with such and such
I say it’s nothin', just fuck and duck
She said ''yeah, right, nigga, what I look like?''
I said ''just like my next daughter or somethin'
So she said ''ohh, you make me sick
I love you, I hate you, I’m leaving, I’m lying
Cause none of them niggas, can never be you, they can never be you, the  "o" nor the "Y"
If she’s over me, I look up to the sky, I see her falling for me like a bomb
She said ''I know you'll miss me when I’m gone''
I just co­sign and we make up for lost time

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
She always say , this is the last time
(She always say , this is the last time)
She love better, than she lie
(She love better, than she lie)
She always say, this is the last time
(She always say, this is the last time)
She said that last time, wait(She said that last time, wait)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I thought you weren’t fucking with me no more

First you change your email, then ya number became private
I bet you think you found another nigga you can vibe with
Quit lying to yourself, retrace all ya steps
Fucking with them suckers, they gonna have ya playing with yaself
I’m a smooth operator; you don’t need a vibrator
Licking everything below, the navel, cause I’m able
Ball so muhfuckin' hard, tape my ankle
Ball so muhfuckin' hard , check my bankroll
First talkin' bout you don't fuck with a nigga, go outta town like you done with a nigga
Really ain't much, she ain't done with a nigga
Shots, straight liquor, make a nigga wanna lick it
I put the ''ex'' in the exceptional, put the ''ex'' in the extra­ho
I put the ''X'' in X and O
I got the game in professional, yeah
My dick is the antidote
She like me on top like an antelope
That time that I smoked with ya bestfriend
I wanted ta fuck ya’ll on the patio
You miss when I kiss on your ear-ring
You miss when I kiss on your clit ring
Thats why I put you in this 16
I’ll fuck you and watch you on the big screen
Yeahhhh!!

[Bridge 2: Lil Wayne]
You always say , this is ya last time
You always say , this is ya last time
You tell her that I care for, you tell her that I care for
You always say, this is ya last time
You always say, this is ya last time
You said that last time, girl wait

Ain't no lifeguard, yeah, I'm a trife God
Yeah, I'm a Drench God, yeah, hit up this park

[Hook]
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work
Yeah, I'm in and out of the ville, yeah, I got a profit to get

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, what?
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, yeah
Day party at my crib, you invited
Day party at my crib, bring a lighter

[Verse]
BBQ, no key cools, no cheap shoes
Good sea food, good beach food
Should teach schools shit been cooped
Could thief jewel, unequal, illegal
I go to Gucci to mingle
Got 'em hot nose like a single
I make a left, hit the blinker
Hublot or the AP, both of 'em cost 80 piece
Mealtime, y'all can barely eat
I'm wired up, I can barely sleep
Told y'all niggas, most y'all niggas, showed y'all niggas
Coach y'all niggas, broke y'all niggas, smoked y'all niggas
Choked y'all niggas, poked y'all women
Had them chickens covered like Tabasco
Bales of weed down the street from the pasture
Got a garage filled up with Caspers
Me and my scale live happily ever after

[Hook]
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work

[Intro]
I wouldn't even...
I wouldn't even be here without that mothafuckin' door
We doing numbers, holmes
5540, we doing numbers, holmes
You can look that shit up, you can research that shit

[Chorus]
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging

[Verse 1]
No doorbell, we had the cameras included
No hibachi, all we had is some tuna fish
Moved up a level, then I stepped up my grind
Got to the top, ain't nobody around
When I look down, all I see is some sucka shit
And I'ma run shit, I put that on my bucket list
Adidas streetball, all the foreigns with the straps
Before the dreadlocks, I had the cornrows to the back
Used to sit on a broke down Camaro with packs
Told her, "Turn around," even though she had his name tatted
That's the way that it was, had a way with the girls
Had a felony before you knew what a felony was
You was taking the shots, you was feeling the buzz
Got so much in the stash spot, I could fill up a bus
Got gorillas with us, got chinchillas with us
No pretenders with us, got the winners with us, yeah

[Chorus]
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging

[Verse 2]
Somebody watching the front door
Yeah I went to college and sold dope
Sold narcotics, a boat load
And all us felons and can't vote
Yeah I'm from the cut, I'm cutthroat
All up in the crowd, Frank Lucas fur coat
Yeah, sipping muddy like a mothafuckin' Merlot
Under the influence, I stayed on the first floor, first floor
Wait, first 48, hard to see my face, diamonds in the way
This is MMA, I just beat the case
In and out the hair salon, she got her nails polished
Turn up in tennis shoes, turn up in red bottoms
Turn up in red bottoms, turn up, turn up in red bottoms
She turn up in red bottoms, yeah what?
A nigga a hustler, now the feds got him
You bring the rubber bands, I bring the money counter

[Chorus]
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging



[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Juicy, squeeze it, then juicy
Sipping on the D'usse
Rocking some Medusa, give a fuck what you say
Give a fuck what you say
In the club, I wrote this for the plug
I wrote this for a hater that was looking for some love
A DJ competition, I'm mixing in the kitchen
Now who gon' do the dishes
Bankroll thicker than Deelishis

[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Drug connotation in my population
I want a conversation, don't want no confrontation
Pull up in a hardtop, watch how I race it
Trap to the wrap like watch how I embrace it
Louis Vans on, they don't come with laces
And we talking straight shots, we don't need no chaser
Tell her I don't chase her, swap her, I replace it
Bracelet, this is Rollie, Rollie, this is bracelet
Pass the medication
Rounds upon rounds, I am nowhere around
I'm nowhere to be found
I'm on flights over lights, I'm so close up to Christ
I might ask for advice, I might ask for it twice
Look at my ice, I'm so nice, it's like Mardi Gras
Mama I shot me a man, please go hide the gun
When she ask me my number, I say I'm the one
Rushing summer to summer until someone come

[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Go ahead and touch the sky
Go ahead and touch the sky
Dancing where you are
Go ahead and touch the sky



[Intro]
Excuse me, excuse me

[Hook]
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
My life is a movie

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I came from the mud
Came from the bottom
Spot 'em, I got 'em
I bought a bandana for 600 dollars
Mr. Miyagi
I like that pussy real soggy
I bought her noodles and sake
Favorite meal used to be chocolate
I used to stay with my cousins
Heat the house up with the oven
Airport tried to make us move without payin' us
We told 'em we ain't budgin'
We stole our cable from next door
It was still a finesse though
I'm still here, where the rest go?
This right here manifesto
I got some gold on my front tooth
And my hair grow like it's kudzu
Told her take a hike like hut two
I was raised by the Huxtables
I was raised in apartments
Right up under that yellow light
Right on top of that bando
Stand on the couch when I feel like, yeah!

[Hook]
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me
Can't make no excuses
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
My life is a movie

[Verse 2]
I'm ghetto, excuse me
Please accept my apologies
This a biography
See through you niggas like radio-ology
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me
I dip my bread in the Kool-Aid
My partner wrecked the new car
He only had that bitch two days
When you was rockin' the new Js
I was servin' some new Js
Went to the prom in a J car
He had just bought a new Mustang
Now I walked around with a digi scale
Paraphernalia in fingernails
Yeah you did dirt, but you finna tell
I used to get 20 of 'em in the mail, yeah!

[Hook]
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me
Can't make no excuses
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
My life is a movie

[Verse 3]
I put hot sauce on my tater chips
The fact I said tater chips
Back on that crazy shit
Me and Ruth Chris, we got a relationship
Yeah I'm ghetto as fuck
I told 'em I got that strong
Tell 'em meet me up the street
For Christmas I want me a stove
For Christmas I want me a scale
For Christmas I want me some sandwich bags
If I go to the hospital
Better put rims on the ambulance
Better put lean in my IV
Nurse better have double Ds
Rest in peace to Double D
I'm from the ghetto, we a hundred deep

[Hook]
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me
Can't make no excuses
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
My life is a movie

[Outro]
You know, as kids we don't choose where we grow up at. You know, it's a living arrangement, it's a living situation. You know, but I'm thankful for everything that I've been through, for every seed that's been planted. You know, everything that grew on me. You dig what I'm sayin'? I come from that. I'm goin' this way, though. You dig what I'm sayin'? Yeah, straight up, a ghetto child, though, man. Super duper blessed, man, super duper blessed. Really anointed, anointed by the Lord so you know, I'm supposed to be here, you know what I'm sayin'? But excuse me, please, excuse me. I'm tryna go that way... that way

[Intro]
Uh let me get a caesar salad, please, with croutons and codeine dressing, and a diet codeine. On a codeine diet. I get all that shit, I get back on that shit

[Hook]
When I get out the bed, I grind, I hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Did it before and I'll do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Do it again

[Verse 1]
Been 'posed to stop drinkin'
Pocket full of Ben Franklins
Y'all niggas been hatin'
Balmain mixtape
Surround the booth with yellow tape
Zip the kush then meditate
Your ladder straight, you featherweight
You heavyweight, it's Saturday
Gladiator, tell your neighbor
Gun on table, Buick LeSabre
Do you now, do you later
Dice game, pool table
Two flavors, too anxious
Got to kill these niggas
I don't feel these niggas
Them some stealin' niggas
Them lil' bitty niggas
On Peter St. at my buildin'
Nigga, Keisha's daycare was half a million, nigga

[Hook]
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Did it before and I'll do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before

[Verse 2]
Fell off, came up
Fell off, came back up
Pulled a doolie in Magic parkin' lot
Came back up
Go to the door, don't get searched
Don't have to pay
Walk in, get ones, order wings
Nigga, this the A
AP, Hublot, Patek, Rollie, gold teeth
Niggas stealin' so much sauce
Them niggas damn near stole me
They stole the swag and they stole my license
You don't know about my sacrifices
Today I worked out on my triceps
Bought a room just to shoot dice in
Whip same color Cicely Tyson
Smokin' gas one of my original vices
Made a mil' off my phone devices
Listen to your own advices
I'm laid up, but I'm prayed up
You a handful, you a A cup
Might rock a jersey and a Jacob
Y'all young niggas need to wake up

[Hook]
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Did it before and I'll do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm popular and poppin' dough
Breakfast at Pappadeaux's
Dodging all obstacles
Trapping at the Stop-N-Go
Boy you know you lame if you still riding stop and go
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Pardon though, I'm harder though
You should read the article
I'm riding high and dodging hoes
You better hope im dodging your
Model hoes dollar hoes, white looking Madonna hoes Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo, and the Prada hoes
College ho Zone 3, niggas with a lot of gold
Snoop guard the door
I just love being by the stove
Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul
Like a comma, I love being right next to O's

[Hook:]
I had a long day
My nerves bad
Yea I'm smoking on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewlery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands,i can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands

[Verse 2: J Hard]
We sitting high speaking like we super human beings
Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus
They say money is the root of all diseases
Well call the docotr I see honest in my thesis
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
Baby momma saying im impatient my sons need shit
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips
In zip locks, and garbage bags
Usher Raymond in this bitch yea I got it bad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz!)
My plug need me, but he greedy
I ran off told me catch me on the TV
See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul
I'm yelling fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Pussy on lock down, I dont hand cuff it
Sipping Grey Goose and we spending mad doucets
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flops, I got bunyons on bunyons
Yellow ring look like a funyon, or somethin'
I just left the trap house, money on money

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, let me catch a motherfucking wave
I got a Chanel surfboard let me catch a wave

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning
Dick look like a flag pole
Gotta catch me a bad throat
Shit, 200 on the dash board
If you feeling froggy lil nigga gonna jump he still a lil tadpole
Yeah I move a little tad slow cause I'm sipping on the castro

[Hook]
Here we go again
I drink a four again
Not going poor again
Young nigga supposed to win
I asked the Lord to forgive me
I used to jugg at Spondivits
Diamonds for wife and the children
This is my life I'ma live it

[Verse 2]
I got Jesus on my pendant
Been hustling since an appendix
When you look up I'm lieutenant
When you look up for attendance
Gucci sun all of my tennis
Make this shit look like a business
Make killers look like a witness
Make shopping look like a fitness
Ran the trap fuck the Olympics
You wasn't there you must missed it
I posted pics on my Insta
Don't you become a statistic
Don't you know I know logistics
Still got Riri on my wishlist
Your lady got me on her hit list
Don't think you gonna forget this

[Hook]
Here we go again
I drink a four again
Not going poor again
Young nigga supposed to win
I asked the Lord to forgive me
I used to jugg at Spondivits
Diamonds for wife and the children
This is my life I'ma live it

[Skit + Hook]
Yeah, I know they like whats he saying
Spondivits, that's some south side shit
Some Atlanta shit, Virginia Avenue
I used to go up in there get me a bucket of crab legs, melted butterBut at the same time I got a jug in the parking lot though, you dig
Here we go again
I drink a four again
Not going poor again
Young nigga supposed to win
I asked the Lord to forgive me
I used to jugg at Spondivits
Diamonds for wife and the children
This is my life I'ma live it
I tell em', I tell em' meet me over there by the Waffle House
I'm selling bags though no lil shit no poquito

[Outro]
Muy grande, muy muy grande, plug talk
You muy poquito, me muy grande



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
So many watches, I need a time capsule
Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel
Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel
In my muscle car, maybe we should arm wrestle
I'm raw, using all caps
I got A on my ballcaps
No, I didn't do it but I thought about it
If I would have did it, it would have chalk around it
Yellow tape, never hesitate
2 Chainz derived from Section 8
Meditate, that's my stress relief
I've been stylin' on 'em since a lease, preach

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
My pop told me men don't cry
Then he turned around and died on me
So I didn't know what else to do
But motherfuckin' cry, homie
Oh yeah, I'm God's son
Tell Nas he got more than one
And me, I got more to see, more to be
Order three, started with a quarter ki'
I'm so ill I need penicill'
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will
And these days, you can't tell who is really real
Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Streets love a nigga, got a D-boy membership
We do it from the heart, I hope art aunt will remember this
Coke on all sentences, cold but no fridge in this
Note to all witnesses, lie or die infamous
My style is so infamous, my style, it needs censorship
Dealer, what's the business? Don't call, I'm busy bitch
Unless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some Benjamins
Niggas say a lot on their way to the top
But you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops so
I guess that's sayin' a lot
But we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Death of a dynasty
I'm talkin' major, not the minor league
And you the last of a dyin' breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague
How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'?
Your niggas got rich but when you died them niggas owed you
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself, I'm scramblin'
Still hard to hold the tears back
Never saw what I became, can't get them years back
Death before dishonor

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will



[Intro]
Gon' make me take a shot of, gon' make me take a shot of apple Crown. Ain't no apple Crown? Uh Cap, that's all Cap

[Pre-Hook]

Told him one time, it was our year
That was last year... now the cash here

[Hook]
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you

[Verse 1]
I drop two verses, they on god level
One goin' state, one goin' federal
I get so busy, don't know what to tell you
Man I had to put love somewhere on my schedule
Ain't no time for that
I had to grind for that
I got the diamonds check
You gon' rewind it back
Nigga I'm so fly, I got the pilot back
Four four bulldog, I'm tryna find 'em dead
From head to toe, I'm wearin' designer hats
If not, I'm somewhere tryin' on a designer hat
One Rolex, one AP
One black and white, one HD

[Hook]
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes

Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you

[Verse 2]
Got my joint filled, with the real killa
Where I come from, my bedroom was real little
Now I'm mansion status, in my apparatus
When they bring my check, I start cabbage patchin'
What's cappin', captain? Around the mat relaxin'
When she look down, I know that's chain reaction
I done been through it, I got a pain reaction
Introduce me to your nigga, I had a lame reaction
Had me all itchin' and shit
I come through on the blitz, I had the shoe with the kit
I got an ink on my body, made the drophead do karate
If I was in a dunk contest, I would jump over Ferrari

[Hook]
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you

Say what the fuck going on, man it must be twerk season
Something in the air, it must be twerk season

Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Big up to my amigo, he gave me a kilo for my ego
Talking 'bout you popped the molly? You just took you a placebo
And my suit is Valentino, she is hot as jalapeno
I can do a drive-by listening to Bobby Valentino
I can make her ass wiggle, I can get some cash with her
Talking 'bout your ex-boyfriend, fuck you and your last nigga
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking 'bout us
Saying something in the air, y'all bitches some ones
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Have you ever got some head while driving in reverse?
I ain't into backing up, but just in case I'm backing out
Now look how she reacting, now I put it in, she asking ow

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Big up to my lil sweet ho, my lil petite ho, keep it a C-note
When my main ho act like a P.O, ain't that frio, that's Sub-Zero
I say one time for that bitch, who just want dick and some to eat
Only want a number three, that's my pussy custody
I want a slim fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got no nosy friends, just a purse with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
Nigga, that's my cup of tea, ahh, burnt my tongue
Ooh, she got a popcorn booty
Everytime I see that ass it make me wanna watch a movie
It's supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerking going on?

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 1]
I ain't never been a minute man
Pour a deuce in a minute maid
Trap house filled with ceilling fans
Weed louder than a hearing aid
Bitch same color lemonade
We don't got to rent a renegade
And I tip my barber a hunnid
The only thing I might get is temple fades
Tryna take another nigga's story
You a fuck nigga and I know it
See I could wear black in the summertime
And I could wear white when its snowin'
I could show you where to go like a local
Order 20 bags out of Oakland
I might buy me a motorcycle
And use your girl for a chauffeur
I'm the realest nigga and the illest nigga
Fuck you lil nigga and your lil sister
Try to use a nigga when it's beneficial
Free all my niggas out the penitentiary
Louis V all on my luggage
Bitch better get on my level
Put a half a milli in a MCM bag
Had that motherfucker looking pregnant

At the same time make her do the dishes
Oh oh oh double middle finger to the picture
Handgun got a nose like Pippen
Girls come through they want to smoke
'Fore they leave this bitch they start strippin'
900 dollars for the tennis shoes
Get a lap dance in the living room
Treat the bathtub like a jacuzzi
Cause the trap house don't got a swimming pool
Money piled up on the counter
Got a hundred round drum in the other counter
Got Ziploc bags and a digital scale and rubber bands all by the money counter
Got raid spray you know how the bugs be
Got a fan in the window by the love seat
And I know it was slow at work tonight
So bitch you better act like you love me

[Hook]

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I treat Goat like he was tata, dealin' up at Popeyes
In the fastlane, I move him over to the right side
Mac-11 life style, burrrt then I hop out
Dem burrrt, then it's lights out, I'm spazin' on you right now
Mama's only child, the crack house was my daycare
Being front to god, grey hair, see that's that old money
Kenmore stove money, packs on G rouge money
Ridin' down in that foreign whip the color of snow bunny
Pull up right to the beach and left the boat runnin'
So Sonny, you a comedian, all your flows funny
Dope funny, walk through the door, she like "Oh honey"
Plus I got a whip and a lock, they call me 4hunna
Tryna come clean off the spot, I'm talkin' detergent
Fuck her then answer my phone, I gotta leave urgent
Everythin' I did in the past was intellectual
Now it's Mr. Gimme-your-section-with-a-extra-booth
Show you what the extra do
Want a four door, so I bought me an extra coupe
One for me, one for me, really ain't no effort to it
Mr. Impeccable, turn you to a vegetable, fuck her on the sectional
Pull on her hair while she's lickin' on the testicles
Sixteen carefully, swag sold separately
Aimin' for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony
Laid on the floor and I made your hoe come vacuum me

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
I'm on my Bobby Brown, babe
Put it on me tenderoni
And I got one of you in every town
To put it on me, I'm never lonely
Swimmin' in your hits, babe
And I'm gone like trip, babe
Show out, show out
Show out, show out, show out

[Bridge: The-Dream]
It's all about you

Nigga fake like wrastlin'
Got cash or plastic
Big cash, cappin'
Six Flags, lotta rides
Turn the beat to a homicide
Microphone look mortified
Lyrical bullets is a .45
I'm doin' 75 on the 75
85 off of 85
200 on 285
None of my cars take 89
Down to get money any time
Life a bitch with no panty line

Weed smellin' like underarm
Turn you suckers into bubblegum

Yeah the trap is my workplace
You know I came from a hurt place

It's the drench god, we don't want nobody to fall
Slip up on this sauce, mane



[Intro]
If Puerto Rico wasn't gone he would be right here with me
If True wasn't gone he would be right here with me
Rest in peace to my niggas from my block
And free all my niggas tryna get some guap
I'm screamin' "Free [?]" till he come home

[Chorus]
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
We some street niggas, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch

[Verse 1]
Yeah, understand, yeah, bust it down
I wanna see you dance bitch, bust it down
I ain't playin', hundred grand bitch, bust it down
I'm on a beast too
Gucci my feet too
Fuck around and buy a mink

On some rims and some tings
Give a fuck what you tings, think, 'bout
I'm in a big clean car
Dope in the sixteen bars
Recited by yours truly
Fuck that bitch playin' Gucci
That's ratchet as fuck
I told her "back it on up"
My jacket matching the truck
I got back in the [?]

[Chorus]
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
Bought a necklace just to flex, bitch

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, partner got a Android
Dippin', dappin', payin' for it
Extra year in the can for it
Concrete damn floor
Dancin' with the devil
Tryna leave the ghetto
Going state or federal
I Golden State the schedule
Gold rose petals
Out of the alphabet
G is my favorite letter
I gotta make it better
Cover the incidentals
[?] a killer, as long as the Lincoln Continental
The lawyers will be here any minute
Used to have commas, now I'm sentenced
Wrist in the bowl bought a Bentley
It got a hole in the ceiling
Partner in the hole for a metro, I think it's silly
Shawty sucked mine so damn long, I got a hickey
She know she prettier than Ricky
She step in blood when she walk
You know them rich niggas in prison
Try to FaceTime ya and talk
This is the greatest of all
Don't want no haters involved
Hold up, I'm taking this call
(Need that chain when I get out, player)

[Chorus]
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch

[Outro]
I'm good, I'm killin' niggas, you know that

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Hair weave killa I'll show up to your funeral
All this work I need a cubicle. Clear coat cuticle
Different color diamonds like a rubrics cube
If this was New Edition, I'll be Bobby Brown
Put the check over your head and call it Nike Town
How could I be down? Free Boosie, wipe me down
My credit card is black and proud
I've been trapping since roxies had the ankles out
I'm going to the money and I took the paper route
Uh Yeh, I'm hood approved and I'm street tested
You a nobody; anorexic
If you stay next to me you're close to a blessing
So, I'm guessin' I could get arrested for aggravated flexin'
With all this ice on. My mic on, I apply pressure like a python
And everybody know this that body flow; bench press, cardio
They try to cramp a nigga style like a Charlie horse
Yeh, they plot on you, and they drop on ya
I put a Glock to your eye and call it glaucoma Bow!
From 30 nights of sipping dirty Sprite
I call this shit Bluetooth because I don't need a mic
2Chainz

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I go hard in the mother fuckin kitchen
Using baby bottles for the lean, wifey say I'm trippin
Plus I got Maybelline smeared right below my zipper
I’m a kama sutra reader and a conjure drinker
Hot on the stove, smoking like reefer
This work ain’t bout shit, that’s why its cheaper
This ho ain’t bout shit, that’s why she cheaper
All we blow is strong, that’s why you weaker!
Wait up, your status change when your weight up
Waiting on the meal, I already put my plate up!
Nigga fall back up, I already put my rake up
Everytime I leave the booth, they put yellow tape up
Hair weave killer, messing up her make-up
Pyrex vision and I’m bout to cook a cake up
Get a fork, add a little water
Get on any track, and I ride it like Marauder

[Hook]
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!

It’s Jizzle 3 Watches, yeah that asshole!
One platinum, one white, one rose gold
Drive a solid gold Rolls to the Rose Bowl
Rosé in the club for my rose hoes
Man fuck these niggas I got blow goals
I count money all night, I need some no-doz
Hater, try one of these, you need a bank roll
Throw the money in the trunk, bitch the bank roll
I go hard in the mother fuckin kitchen, nigga
Got me staring at that water like I’m fishing, nigga!
Never know about me, I pull a bass out
Drop a 250 in and pull a half out
Had to do it for the town and the trap niggas
Me and 2 Chainz, its over for you rap niggas
And nothin says butter like Parkay
And nothin make them Jay's stutter like hard yay

[Hook]
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!

[Verse 3: Pusha-T]
Started in the kitchen, king of the whipping
Denzel in glory, tear drop was missing
Just like the roof is, riding in that Chris Brown
Two seater deuces, peeling like I skip town
Pocket full of brick money, neck full of black gold
Black diamonds got the Jesus piece like Manute Bol
That’s 2 Chainz, I'm 2 Stoves
For every one I cook, I make two clones
Mary Kate and Ashley, Tia and Tamera
Two in the Four like the Porsche Panamera
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Vision clouded by the coke, ain’t making it clearer
I make it look easy, I rap it up greazy
Bandanna round the brick, I make it look look Jeezy
But I push a ton of it, get the name right
Who else could fly it in and land on the same flight?...

[Hook]
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!

When I'm alone in my room, sometimes it look like the mall
In the back of my mind, I ball harder than y'all
I used to have an old school that I sat on some dubs
For the first time in my life, mama knew I sold drugs
There it was, hustlin' across the way
Went in on my first ounce with Big Shay
AG had orange, DC had white
Lil cuz got murked, you ain't seen that life
I done bought at least two chains more than twice
Count money from the night 'til the mornin' light
Had a convo with God, I told him, "Thank you, Lord
Cause everything that I've got, I'd like to thank you for"

Diamonds on my teeth, lick the clit, now it's shinin'
Ate a caesar salad, I dropped carats in my salad
Pinky ring, water wrist, water neck, frigid, yeah
Glasses vintage, car vintage, I'm about to get it, yeah
Pocket full of money, nothin' less than a 50, yeah
Smokin' on a zip, nothin' less than a hippy, yeah

And yeah I got me a bankroll I need a buncha ones

I used to run the base like A-Rod
When I get me a check, I'mma buy me some extra
When I get me a check, I'mma buy me a necklace
When I get me a check, I'mma eat her for breakfast
When I get me a check, niggas gotta respect it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I earned all my stripes like A-Rod, worth 25 mill
That's a whole lot of money, man somebody get killed
Que pasa, que pasa, you know that I'm proper, I run with my partners
We need us a doctor, for drinkin' the vodka
That piña colada, I might shit a lobster
I just said that shit with my eyes closed
I can count a hundred thousand while I'm blindfolded
See you out, nigga, watch I get to it
CUI, nigga, mean the chopper under influence
Now watch how I limp to the bank, dreads hangin' under my A hat
If I got sucked by a teller, I would never tell you but that would be Bankhead
A1 nigga from the south side, I need a spot light
I need a chinchilla, before I get frostbite
Put the white girl in the middle, call it Klondike
Take her the to the room after dinner, and fuck her like it's prom night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Move around my town like A-Rod
Playin' with that girl like Baywatch, Tony Hawk skate off
Steroid, on your ass like Hemorrhoids
Cash out with that pen boy, your pass out see the invoice
When I get that check, I'mma call Madonna
Call up Cameron Diaz, call up Daisy Fuentes
Dikembe on them hoes like no-no, not in my house, you can't stay
You can smoke and you can drink and bend it over, let me play
God dammit, I done came up, nigga
35K take the plane up, nigga - 35 cars, 35 chains, nigga
Gettin' this change, never changed up, nigga
When I get that check, I'ma buy you a fake ass
With your fake ass, we don't count money, weigh cash
Breakin' up the rock, Dame Dash
When you're talkin' 'bout work, was my day job

Mix it up, drink it, stay high

[Hook: 2 Chainz]



(2 Chainz!)
Yeah, roll another one cause I’m winnin
In my four door looking real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won’t expire
I’m in a class of my own, my teacher got fired! (HA-HA)
Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses,did it from the wee hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power then you get respect
I’m getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I’m thinking
Bought that ho a ring, it was for her pinky
Uhn, that’s pimpin’ that’s slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent
(Tell'em!)
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, No Lie already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with an ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys we bring ‘em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche ‘em, we clean ‘em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence
If you got work, go to work, don’t work at your residence

Mama saying boy why y'all playing in that water

Whoadie mama said I know y'all boys ain't been to school
Hit the D-mall like a motherfucking school

Nigga wanna play then okay somebody get shot
Rollies for the whole team, urine full of codeine
Pounds on the Sunbeam, baby bottles with more lean
I'm young and dumb and I ain't got no patience
I'm 'bout to pull up at the trap and see what's shaking
I bought me fifty he front me fifty, I thought 'bout taking it
My nigga told me don't do it so I went paid the man
I let your bitch come to me and then told her get away from here
Strong packs and calculators, ain't nothing but a pint in that refrigerator

[Verse 1]
It's going down if I say so
I come to raise hell, call me Halo
I'm growing up
I'll be out in a couple months
See right now I'm hanging out in my mama front
Oh dad, I heard you used to like sports, yeah?
Used to keep money in a sports bag
Heaven said you ain't be home in some weeks, nigga
Don't go starting that shit with me, nigga
By the time I get bigger I need a father figure
Someone to lean on
Sipping lean with your team, [?] big screen on you
You looking like a fiend, ho
You rap about triple beams only
In every argument you try to make my mama seem wrong
Fuck you, nigga

[Interlude 1]

[Verse 2]
And Harmony know I'm coming
She would no longer be the youngest
She keep kicking mama in the stomach
I'm gon kick your ass when I get there
You know sibling rivalry, it's all love
We'll all fight and then all hug
Like damn daddy got a ball court
I'm like damn daddy got a four wheeler
Damn daddy got a sports car
Damn daddy been wanting a lil nigga
We got enough land to find Sasquatch
Damn mommy, daddy making money
What the hell you complaining about?
So what if he was fucking with girls
As long as he don't even bring them hoes to the house
Heaven straight, Harmony cool
I can't wait to get my own room
I can't wait till home room
I can't wait I'll be home soon like
I can't wait to meet them, can't wait to meet them
I gotta hug now mom
Gotta hug GGG, get babysitted by nanna

[Interlude 2]



[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout my commas, I'm 'bout my come up
Young nigga run up, run up the summer
Tats on my stomach like Makaveli
Back of the back in the back of Telly's
With the racks in the sac I will rap on belly
They will act real really niggas acting sidity
Ain't no Actavis in the city, woah

[Hook]
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg

[Verse 2]
We spend it and get it back, we had invented that
See we on the internet, fly as an insect
Shine like the moonlight, told 'em gesundheit
I'm throwing cheese up like it's a food fight
They talking ‘bout that dough and I tell you, I do not believe 'em
When I was on Codeine I went to the store and bought all of the liters
Follow the leader, monkey see, monkey do
It was critical bought the [?] went and bought three pair of shoes
Trapping all night, you know the rules
Trapping all night, it ain't no rules
I pay my dues, copped it in twos
And all I do is sell shit, I should go on a cruise

[Hook]



[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
Walkin' like I got a kilo
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

[Verse 1]
I come in this bitch so fast, let me slow up on niggas
I fuckin' that bitch with the ass, and she hold up on niggas
You know that I'm drinkin', I pour up on niggas
My style, and just like I throw up on niggas
I don't fuck with niggas especially a ho nigga
VIP, I pour Moët on niggas, ayy
Triple beam to a digital scale, I got work in the mail
Clientele, I need a tractor trailer and a Ms Griselda
And I ain't into failure, and I don't even know what to tell you
I ain't got no work to sell you
I got hope to sell you, got me a boat to sail in
Ain't no joke like Rakim
Got the trap house rockin', you ain't get that shit
I got me a half, that's a split when I flip it
And whip it 'til I get me 36s
I get it, I got it, I'm slangin' narcotics
I sold dope in college, I'm semi psychotic
Might put the semi on niggas
Never keep bricks in mi casa

[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo

Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

[Verse 2]
I do this shit for the A
Y'all get the fuck out my way
I bought a car just to race it
I pass the car just to chase it
This is a standing ovation
The trap was my standin' location
Hit the strip club in the day shift
Give a lil' bitch a donation
Fresh to my bootlaces
I just beat me a few cases
I just told myself...
"Self, I need me a new bracelet"
Who the fakest? You the fakest
Lose or take it, rule to bacon, rude awaken
You forsaken, you replacement
Got me a jacuzzi in the basement
If it was a real nigga party
You couldn't get an invitation
You niggas is basic, you bitches is basic
I'm fuckin' two hoes in two different locations
You sittin' adjacent, you need a rotation
You need a quotation
Oh my medulla is mula
That pussy so close I can taste it

[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
Walkin' like I got a kilo
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

End of conversation I'm running out of patience
You can't play me they don't play me on the station
Ain't no debatin', rappers get eaten
Keep it on the low I fucked your girl in the basement
Down for anything, but I don't fall for Nathan
I go to the jewelery store for a vacation
Celebration, dedication
I rob a nigga in his sleep, Freddy mixed with Jason
They got me paranoid all these different faces
I know somebody the police I can fucking taste it
Mmm mmm mmm, I can smell a rat
Fire, fire, fire, let them feel the gat
O O O O that's a quarter pack
Nigga four Os nigga throw like a quarterback

[Hook x2]
Small things to a giant, its too easy
Just got dressed I'm colder than the flu season
Its too easy its too easy
Its too easy its too easy

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I do this in my sleep I need to change the covers
Menage a trois and I dont change the rubbers
Nasty nigga so dont ask a nigga
Black and ashy flashy with charisma
A pack of cigarillos and 2 liter
And that's just for two people
Trynna get numb nigga cuz my feelings hurt
Dealing work I'm a go to jail I keep killing verses
I got a hard top I'm about to convert
Bought her ass a bag and paid they phone service
Name brand head to toe walking in strokers
Two girls on my coat walking out of strokers
Its a small thing the big foot
That's why I stalk my money taller, the six foot
And I'm motivated to get more of it
Rich nigga getting private dances in public

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cap-1]
I say its too easy me and two Breezys
Everything around me sick, flu season
Got the minis popping pack doing them calisthenics
Pack of bitches trynna make a movie for the final edit
Shouts out to my bad bitch that red ho with them tattoos
That fat ass and them green eyes got green guys my trap boom
Got work to sell got pounds of kush
Break it down got ning dings
Got nine hoes need nine mo, roster Bruce Springsteen
That mac 11 start talking fast
That paper stacking like Kinkos
Blowing strong popping bands
These niggas stealing our lingo
And I'm TRUed up got two cups
Me and 2 Chainz go too nuts
Two guns and I'm deuced up
22s and I'm couped up
Low pro crew cut
She fuck with me then my crew fuck
Chicken noodle she souped up
And I'm layed back with my boots up
Louie V got Damier
Now Im out of town brought mami there
Then me go call said bring that all
That female with me went to see Javier and I'm gone

[Hook]



[Shane Caldwell]
Time in my life I was down so low, a mosquito wouldn't even bite me
I lost my job, my 4 wheel drive, I even got throwed out of my trailer
All because of one thing: freebasing cocaine. That's all my life was, was basing, nothing else. I was on that last lap, with that checker flag about to wave me on into hell

But I got lucky, I got into rehab program down der in Redstone Arsenal down der in Alabama and with dem people helpin' me. Well that smoking white devil is no longer a part of my life.  I can proudly say, that white devil is no longer a part of my life and I can proudly say, that today, I do not freebase cocaine

Now I'll take a drink, now. I will take a drink but I do not freebase cocaine. You know, well, I take a drink and I might even smoke a little reefer. You know, you know I like to smoke reefer. You know, it relaxes me and everything. A couple doobies, you know, just ta get you through the day and everything. But, far as basin goes, I don't do it

Now I'll do some toot now. Don't get me wrong. I will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything, and somebody comes up and gives it to you, its impolite not to take it there. So me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you. We do party. You know, I will do some toot. We'll do, you know, on a good weekend there we call a bunch of friend over we'll do bout an eight ball of toot there but we don't base. I do not freebase cocaine. I want to make that clear. I don't do it



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
My mind for the intellectual
Had sex with her on my sectional
Slowed it down, take it extra slow
Bust on myself like plexi co
Oh alright here I go
Shorty got my love in the finger fold
I got a manicure, pedicure
I got her hair done and credit card new
I'm balling on her big time
Told shorty I'm 6'5"
Stand up on my bankroll, make me look like I'm 6'9"
She look like she been fine
She always call me big time
Pinky ring on, you should see the way I sip wine
I'm maestro in the main suite
Make a side chick out your main squeeze
Better hop on board 'fore the train leave
Shorty outta place cause I slang D
And I'm changes need my chain freeze
Meant to say my chain froze
Everytime I change clothes

[Hook: Betty Idol]
Cherish the game
When we fly far away
Sky dive in a puddle of mud
Make it rain blue dolphin
All I see is blue dolphin
(x2)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I like when she smile
She like when I make her smile
She like when I put it down
She like when I come in town
I like when she on the brown
She like when I'm on the loud
Seen her take some coke then smile
Seen her take a perc then pow
Birkin bag see no salt
All on the beach with toes out
All on the beach sea gulls out
All in the jeep windows down
Where I come from the Regals out
She knows I turn up on the molly
She doing string thing for money
I'm trying to put it in her tummy
I might whisper in her earlobe
I'm blowing kisses in her earlobe
I'm telling things she ain't built for
Money long as Lincoln Continentals
Codeine with a touch of Sprite
Geeked up for a hundred nights
I'm a roll had a Cuban link
In a figaro this a finger roll

[Hook]

(Musical Break)

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Reek Da Villain]

Aye yo weak minded bitches fall victim because my charm’s strong jazzy pair of louis on my feet Chewy Armstrong
Ma couldn’t be my cheerleader with platinum pom-poms she the type to misrepresent a king like Lebron’s mom
Beating on my chest with a crown King Kong Don Langston Hughes I write a poem that do the Bible psalms harm
These other rappers want problems then bring it on umm this rapping beef is nothing my studio’s in its long form and all cowards’ll become victims of man
Keep a 5th of Remy and a stick of piff in my hand yeh they fly but I’m a pilot that no one can understand plus the way I go ham’ll make a Muslim say damn
Hustle hard trips to Miami for three days so I can meet with the connects and get the D Wade run up in the Gucci store and drop 3k you bum I could get your whole outfit out of BJ’s
Lyrical scientist leaving mics with psoriasis so it’s [bleeped] as Michael Myer’s psychiatrist pyrics suppliacist who being lying stiff when the iron spits I come alone just me and one 9 Johnny [Unitis]
And let my bitch serenade through these slums and blow so much loud I need a hearing aid for my lungs
And as far as metaphors rate this I was a snail ‘til haters threw salt on me and I dissolved into greatness

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]

What goes around comes around like a hula hoop. Hair weave killa I’ll show up to your funeral
All this work I need a cubicle. Clear coat cuticle. Different color diamonds like a rubrics cube
If this was New Edition, I’ll be Bobby Brown. Put the check over your head and call it Nike Town
How could I be down? Free Boosie, wipe me down. My credit card is black and proud
I’ve been trapping since roxies had the ankles out. I’m going to the money and I took the paper route
Uh Yeh, I’m hood approved and I’m street tested. You a nobody; anorexic
If you stay next to me you’re close to a blessing. So, I’m guessin’ I could get arrested for aggravated flexin’ with all this ice on. My mic on, I apply pressure like a python. And everybody know this that body flow; bench press, cardio. They try to cramp a nigga style like a Charlie horse
Yeh, they plot on you, and they drop on ya. I put a Glock to your eye and call it glaucoma
Bow! From 30 nights of sipping dirty Sprite. I call this shit Bluetooth because I don’t need a mic. 2Chainz

I think I may have to take it back to like, like 10 years ago, you know
BIG MEECH ERA (you feel me?)
Real Real Motivation for a street nigga  *2

VERSE 1
Pull up in all color Ferraris
Bitches in Tiaras
Gettin' head while I'm steering
Everybody else starving
Everybody else starring
Shawty got the Mclarian and I had the 7

Pulled up at the Compound, clothes smelling like gun powder
Salute all the real niggas and real bitches who got they own bottles
I was snapping before fabo my raps come wit aHalo
Went out with Jeezy we spent pesos like J-bo
Took E’s to the 20 grand he got a pistol on him and 20 grand
A couple things I ain't glorifying is the kids dying and the mommas dying (Scarface)
Everybody need to calm down stand right by your homie  side
Gunshots in this motherfucker turn this bitch into a homie-side (yeah)

CHORUS
Over a million sold they say Im crossing over..
Oh yeah the club packed, I should’ve brought a rubber
My whole body inked, my family hardly know me
You know I put that work in just to get a Rollie (I did)
BIG MEECH ERA
Japanese Dinner
Trap in these denim  (damn)
Ain't stuntin these women (naaa)
Wood Grain steering wheel I just might catch a splinter. (
If this a flexing contest I think we found a winner
I think we found a winner
Pull up in some shorts middle of December

“Put this shit down, that shit, I can smell that moon rock “
I got  to tell you how that shit started
Verse 2
Trapping off the court on the back porch (I DID)
Had that pack ordered. We was back door. (We was nigga!)
That’s that good shit that’s that hood shit (WE HOOD)
You a cute bitch and your crew thick (I LIED)
Got a chopper on me the size of pool stick (this long)
With a blu davenchy, dog food bricks (Heroin)
Snowman on repeat, Rest In Peace Nando
I see Jigg in here I see Quazy too
When brawl witchu we send them bottles through we send the marters through
Im on the Carter 2
Like Tyrese was on the Marta too
They start calling too
They starting falling through
Got them chickens boy like a barb b q (tell em)
Talk to lame niggas something we hardly do
I sip the PJ bottle I rock the AP on them. (okay)
I think my rollie harder this an AG PARTY

CHORUS *2



[Intro]
Yeah... okay... 2 Chaaaaaaiiiiiinnnzzzz

[Verse 1]
Crap game at the Blue Flame, gamble up my loose change
2 Chainz, 'nuff said, throw money at her fo'head
Think about it, wait a minute think about it
Her pussy so wet it look like she wasted some drink around it
Best in Atlanta you really don't have to think about it
A nigga so cold my microphone got a mink around it
Tity 2 Chainz and the 2 means I'm double illa
2 hands on my balls nigga call it double dribble, uhhh

[Hook]
Think about it... now think about it
Think about it... jus think about it
Think about it... think about it
Now think about it... jus think about it

[Verse 2]
Think about the half, y'all don't know the half
Used to sell them bags, now I'm selling swag
Tell ya bitch to come here, tell ya bitch to come here
I'm only in town for a night, you can have her back when I dip
Smoke half a bag and I'm ripped, take another pull and I sip
I'm with my crew we high look like we walking around on stilts
Walking around on blimps, and we pushing weight
Got my pockets looking built, I draw gas the illest straight yeahh
Picture that. Take a picture. Pick a date
I come to ya city real soon and watch them titties shake
Anyway, I owe my girl one we did the 68
I'm real good at math so I know that don't mean penetrate
I'm coming off the top of my dome 'cuz my pen escaped
Nigga know this if you do not know anything
2 Chainz stay down like tennis shoes
I need a mil, wanna go to dinner soon

[Hook repeated]



[Chorus]
Pretty Girls Like Trap Music, that's me
Pretty Girls Like Trap Music, that's me

[Verse 1]
MAC-11 and the crack I'm sellin' in my DNA
Frito-Lay, Aston Martin there's no need to kid and play
Pick a day, bet I'll pull up on your ass with dealer plates
Paper plates was my dinner plate, you prolly can't relate
This that Dre mixed with 3K, Wayne and Kanye
Andale, want no bullshit, no need to perpetrate
Purple drank in that dirty cup, down south, MC Eiht
Down south MC Eiht, LA call me down south MC Eiht
Half a million for the restaurant I have to renovate
Man I got so many demons, please don't make me demonstrate
I know trappers, rappers, actors, got the Phantom 'fore the mansion
Man that's backwards, ass-backwards, I'm a bachelor and I'm handsome
And I'm straight up off the porch, and I landed in a Porsche
And I ended on The Source, man I'm on the right course
Turn your body to a corpse, turn this beat into a corpse
Turn this beat into a Bobby then shake and bake like Ricky Bobby, woo!
Crib so big the livin' room like a lobby, woo!
I can damn near fit a pool in the lobby, woo!
Got your girl in here 'bout to drool in my lobby
Cuz' is a Blood, he like to bool in my lobby, yeah

[Chorus]
Pretty Girls Like that Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop that shit around June 16th
Pretty Girls Like that Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop it on your ass June 16th

[Verse 2]
First I met the plug, then I met his sister
Bought 20 packs, then I turned around and kissed her
Then you know I left, I been left, Derek Fisher
Had a lot of prize, but I'm tryna get richer

[Chorus]
Pretty Girls Like Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop it on your ass June 16th
Pretty Girls Like that Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop it on your ass June 16th

[Verse 3]
Man I got a dog, I paid 10 G's for it
Fucked up her hair and bought a quick weave for it
Somebody please come and get these boys
L.A. Leakers, come and get these boys
Smokin' on the loud, man I'm known to bring the noise
This ain't Santa Claus when I'm comin' with the toys
Got a duffle bag, man I got a duffle bag
Got them suckas mad, man I got them, woo!



[Hook-2 Chainz]
This my letter to the rap game
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane
I did what I had to do when the pack came
This is my letter to the rap game
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane
I did what I had to do when the pack came

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Chef what's happenin', Ghost what's up
Wu Tang Clan, they ain't nothin to fuck, wait
2 Chainz ain't nothing to fuck with
Need search warrants cause these niggas is suspects
All I talk is money so Chainz is the subject

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Came in this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Two to be exact, grinding the kush pact
Ride with the roof back, live with a suit act
Killing em, so I am dying my suit black
Dear rap game, you are ill homie
Havin me thinking we were gon' make some real money
Came from the streets, I'm a beast, capiche?
Like my dick in the mailbox when the bills come, oh!
And hey rap game, the real comin'
The way I'm murking these niggas hope your will comin'
And when you're numb, it's kind of hard to feel somethin'
I'm the type to get rich and still hustle, yeah
And before I leave let me say this, play this
Have my niggas dead or in jail like Asic
Face it, back to the basics
2 Chainz on them bitches, looking like Vegas, the greatest

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
My worlds coming to an end, speaking philosophical
Six's on the coupe, when they said it was impossible
Got the type of guns to make the city feel uncomfortable
And we breaking bricks down, till the last molecule
Cherish the horizon, sun blessed party, hey
Thinking 'bout this business, and it's time that I gave away
Trying to make a plan today, niggas on there way
Locked in confinement, gotta learn to levitate
And on the inside, my instinct, I survive
All I got left is pride, touchdown, I'mma ride
I was raised as a boss
Damn, I let a nigga take me off
And let him tell Josh that his pops was soft
Mothafucker

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Rocking blood diamonds, cooling in the hood with the goonies
Gambling and scrambling, trying to buy us some guchi's
It's a movie made, regardless, my crooks is the hardest
Buying crazy pots and pans, stay in apartments
Bank roll was all we ever needed
While niggas was weeded, playing spades, and pumping crack in adidas
Just fly young with heart, I sift in the park
Made sales, blazed a few shells, yeah fuck who you are
Guns on us, I make you cry like onions come through
Stay in your lane, peep the name and we done it
I was legend yet, now my papar stretching, yeah, that's it
Go ask the Rocky Glass, "I class act?"
Villas, movie-making gorillas, the willas
The guest-star gun fights, squeeze on the squealers
Don't come near me, nigga
If you don't got no money, fear me
Matter fact, move it, ya hear me?



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Turn the whole block to Vietnam
Made some legal money, ran off on Uncle Sam
Every seven days I might smoke a quarter bag, bag, bag
Bad bitches in my picture
Take yo ho and fuck her on the low just like a whisper
Dom Perignon by the pitcher, I used to eat at Crystal’s
Nah, I’m just lying, I used to meet at Crystal’s
Duffle bag zippers, who the fuck gon’ zip that bitch up?
Me and that bitch we gon’ ride in the trunk
Cause the hood of the car is not in the front
I did it fo’ them, no, I did it fo’ me, so, they did it fo’ them
And I like when that pussy go splash, so I told ‘er let’s go fo’ a swim

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Aye, my nigga, come get yo bitch
She outside my traphouse stalkin’

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I spoil all my clientele, and my little bitch, she spoiled rotten
Just fucked a 20k on good weed and designer shoppin’
Summer time, just made it, I’m thinkin’ drop top Spider Rarri
Who there callin’ my phone? If it ain’t about money then I ain’t talkin’
Pocket full of Franklins on me, I call that shit gangsta walkin’
Aye, my nigga, come get yo bitch, she outside my traphouse stalkin’
I valet the coupe and Nieman Marcus, I went in and ate lunch
And say that we run the streets, I say we just give em what they want
Yup, give 'em that crack, make em come back
Just scraped these six figures out the road spent it on the set
Hmm, like LL, I’m in too deep with it
Little momma pussy so good, man, that I almost fell asleep in it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cap 1]
Aye, my nigga, come get yo bitch, she out my traphouse stalkin’
Panamera on the Forgies, I’m flossin’, 458 with the horsie
I got that packet from Cali, I can break it down
And have everything gone by the mo’ning
Have the amigo pull up with 1000 meetings
I can run through yo city like Jordan
Nigga, my cousin, my women imported
Yo, bitch on my bumper, you can get extorted
I call my plug and I tell him bring me more
Don’t worry bout me, worry bout where yo ho at
Nigga, yo bitch outside my traphouse skeetin’
Bitch outside, she stalkin’
285, just ride, smokin’ precious, you trippin’, I left that bitch walk in
I got these racks so big I can’t fold it
I got yo bitch, yo shawty got ebola
We sellin’ that coke, we no call it a come up
Makin’ em G’s, ya gotta stay 100
That precious gas pack, we smoke it and punch in
I don’t do dinners, no movie, no nothin’, no lunches, we fuckin’
And that’s the end of that discussion

[Hook]

Okay you know that I'm illy, my home is worth a milli'

It's all the same, only the names will change 
Everyday it seems we're wasting away 
Another place where the faces are so cold 
I'd drive all night just to get back home 

I'm a cowboy (x 4)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
YE!

Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
I'm a cowboy, chicka pow pow boy
Shoot you from the floor to your fuckin-YE-YE!
Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
YE!
Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
I'm a cowboy, chicka pow pow boy
Shoot you from the floor to your fuckin eyebrow boy
2 Chainz name ringing like an Android
I think about money every time I brainstorm
And I'm in rare form if I've got Airs on
Niggas know I'm buying Guccis like they fucking Air Jordans
Outlaw lifestyle, I made a mill trapping
I'm trynna take the 'T' off and make a mill rapping
Codeine, fetti, shorty all white porcelain
Reverse cowgirl, shawty ride a nigga like a horse

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]

2 CHAINZ!
It ain't no secret, I'mma get it
I'm over niggas heads like an ATL fitted
I'm over bitches house like I'm only gonna visit
When they try to make me stay I tell them "That's some strong liquor"
You know what time it is
I'm on the strong and the sizzurp
And since a young nigga, I've been on with the wiz-ord
A nigga play me wrong I put his dome in the diz-irt
I'm going on tour, I'm going be gone till November
Ruthless, ice cubes all on my sizz-erp
Pinky ring huge, such a mofuckin insult
And if you riding dubs, then my rims are much older
Two white cups, and one cup holder
Told ya, grab me a soda
Shake it like a shake-weight
Hit you with two 4x4s, that's an 8x8
And it's not that I don't like ya, but I hate hate
I know they gonna hate on this, and I can't wait

[Outro: DJ Teknikz]



[Verse 1]
Uh
Resident Evil around these parts
Peanut got killed in his front yard
They say "catch up", but I'm a star
F & N, for body guards
My whole squad vs. your whole squad
357, I play the odds
College park, I got the ink
Kill't the game, I wore like a mink

[Hook]
I said "fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, I get that dough
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, and get this dough

[Verse 2]
Woke up this mornin', I look like this
Yellow pinky ring, it look like piss
I smell like gas, with a hint of Bond
Don Perignon and Saint Laurent
Ferragamo frames, I kick my dab
Might sell a bag, cause I miss my dad
RIP to a real OG
Only thing I smoke is real OG
Only thing I trust in the world is bank
Jus' went to jail with my partner, now we drug related
Walk in the buildin', get a hunnid stares
My 'partment buildin, had a hunnid stairs
Puerto Rican  Johnny had a hunnid squares
Hair Weave Killa, I am out on bail
Bought a pair of Jordan's just to trap in, nigga
Bought a pair of Yeezy's just to rap in, nigga
Bought me a mansion, I deserve that shit
Bought a Maybach, cause Jay Z did
Bought me a Sprinter, cause I seen TI's
Bought me a Coogi cause I seen BI's
Triple zero bags, from the store up the street
Use the same scale, for the coke and the weed
South Florida home, coconuts in the trees
Before all the Gucci, I was rockin' with G's
It ain't a drive by, if you walkin' away
So much money, you could walk in my safe
I can't see me no'l, like Florida State
By the time you get that, I'll be on the way

[Hook]
I said "fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, I get that dough
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, and get this dough



[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Ok I done figured it out, I know what you niggas about
We slanging narcotics, you know that we got it
There’s never ever a drought
My partner just did a whole decade
I just put the beam on the AK
I jumped in the air fuck what you usin' young nigga
I’m busting, you ducking and moving
She sucking and fucking, I do it
I do it, I do it, I do it
Put that bitch right on the wood
I’m taking it back like a starter
They busting like mortar, they busting the hollow
She model, she swallow
That sperm like it’s water
Everything on Forgiatos
You knowing I’m getting it like no tomorrow
Got 50 niggas from Chicago ready to crack your taco
Whip a brick like I whip an auto
Just made a juug at McDonalds
Just bought me ten cars, no car note
Only thing I dodge is potholes, clap bitch your ass with no bravo

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Fifteen, suddenly I want to sing
Sixteen, fucking hoes, selling drink
I started sipping, got addicted just like nicotine
Such a fiend, not just for lean, for these fucking B’s
Although I lean, I smoke Irene like I’ve got a disease
Oh yeah I rap and sing, don’t you know I rap and sing
And in my hood and what I’ve seen
You probably wouldn’t last a week
And in my hood the good never outweigh the bad
Don’t be mad at me
Somebody call the pastor please, a young nigga killing shit
Young nigga killing shit
She want to hear me sing like Marvin
I turn the bitch gay no Marvin
And I'll probably leave a bitch starving
Cause I really do be illin' though
When I get to flowing I can’t stop going
A young nigga poppin' like I got dropped [?]

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands

[Verse 3: Cap 1]
First I get this money, then I pop them bands
Shawty say she want to pop the pussy
I’m just blowing money like a fan
Got them gold [?] shoes cost a band
Got the molly and I sell it by the gram
Got some bitches that's for it, niggas steady getting naked
I done fell asleep when I was on a Xan
Imma treat her like a dog, I’m a dog
In the kitchen water whipping with the fork
In the club tryna order 100 bottles
I done came a long way from that Impala
So I’m balling like I’ve never seen tomorrow
Shawty want to hit me in the head like a boxer
Niggas ain’t real, they imposters
I’m just sitting back eating pasta
I just ordered shrimp with the lobster
Fucking up the [?] in the mall, popping tags
One call put them killers on your ass
Got gas, need 34 hundred for the bag
Mason Margiellas and the PIPs
When I pull out that weed I say I’m outcha league
Got them foreign vehicles that don’t take a key
Bitches on my line, I can’t get no sleep

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands



[Verse 1]
I been on the road so long, I forgot what kind of cars I got
I rap so much I forgot what kind of bars I got
Rose in the concrete, grows to the top
Son of a gun, raised by a Glock
Georgia Power was  off  I was raised in the dark I don't know if it faze me or not
No telling
If I didn't turn 15 I wouldn't have been a felon (I bought it)
I bought the violence in my stick shift
If you don't shoot or get shot at you ain't go through adolescents
If you ain't go through all the pressure, You ain't get all of your blessings
What you know about not being able to re up going through depression
What you do about aggression, What you do about confession
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Hook]
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Verse 2]
Crunching numbers with [?] heads
7 figures in Buckhead
I get dough till its enough bread
Money tall so it's enough said
It was toom poom, Baby amp and big U stand for upset
I can tell you where the plug at he over there where my cuz at
Say I'm under the influence I was down stairs where the drugs at
40 cal, 50 cal, even my momma tote a pistol now
They call on that Crenshaw only thing we need is a mister child
You already know what this about, I shouldn't be riding around with this amount
Cause I can take your bitch with this amount
And take her on a trip with this amount
I look like a lick, act like I'm rich
Talk like a whip, walk like a brick
Fly like a blimp, right over the public
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Hook]
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Outro]
Crunching numbers with [?] heads
7 figures in Buckhead



[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena

Hashtag makin' bands, yes I am
Hashtag makin' bands, yes I am
Nigga do ya thing, BOOM

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage
Young street nigga coming from the pot
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Done it, done it, done it man I'm runnin' up
Tity Boi 'bout to fuck the summer up
Order some new things for the Wraith
3rd chain on to get her naked
I'ma poster child for the hustle
You a poser child for them bustas
Game up for grabs, I'ma take it
Try to stay down like the pavement
Live by the code, keep it true
Anything and everything to get a loot
Nigga think they trill but I'm triller
Nigga think they ill but I'm iller
Nigga think they big but I'm larger
Pussy you ain't nothin' but a target
Smokin' on joints, gettin' massages
Keep dodgin' me and I charge up

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt

They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Take the straight razor hit with the 50 slab
Bitch I move all of that weight I just might hit my dab
Niggas got that funny money I'm trying' not to laugh
In the back of that Rolls treat it like a cab
Got an F in science but an A in math
[?]
30 for the 36 you don't know the half
Movin' through my city like I'm Godzilla
Your favorite rapper seen a bird, it was on Twitter
Let me hear your bird call nigga tweet tweet
.40 Cal with the dick nigga skeet skeet
I think I fell in love with the kitchen sink
Got my eyes on that money I can't even blink
Any nigga bout that talkin' cray, think he need a shrink
Just copped a new Rolly had to lose a link
Kill him in the valet, murder was the case
Bitch I call my safe Mars cause it's outta space

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet

[Intro]
(Okay) Free Tunechi, Yeah
2 Chainz! Hey, Hey, Hey

[Hook]
I got a bad bitch, she more than cute
And bitch I'm balling, I'm talking more than hoops
This is that fish scale, nigga we water-proof
I got into it with my car and I said fuck the roof
Fuck the roof, fuck the roof, fuck the roof, f-fuck the roof
Top back and I'm getting loot
Blowing smoke up in the air and saying fuck the roof

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm in my black car chilling with my yellow ho (Yellow ho)
It's a two seater but it's known to carry fo'(Okay)
2-2 Chainz, Gucci carry-on
I got my Gucci shades, now I just carry on
And I got four zips off in my Styrofoam
See you niggas couldn't reach me on the telephone
We the two gun gang nigga, uncaged
On the front page known to leave niggas rugs stained
And I bought my mistress a sharpay
And I bought my yellow bitch a mustang (Get out of here)
Long hair, nigga no fade
And I just bought a watch that cost a whole thang

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm blowing smoke in here, tell me where's Smokey Bear
They say I look like a chimney when I'm on the chair
I'm standing in the vip, I'm parked in the vip
I go from vip to vip so much that I'm nauseaous
Yellow ice caution, I'm cautious, yield
My girl like to wear her heels when she on the vodka
Real conversate, wine, and a lobster plate
I'm 'bout to doctor on this track, it's time to operate
Operation, dedication, time to meditate
Twenty-eight inches make this bitch levitate
I'm on a level where these other niggas feather weights
Southside, '09, rolling packs everyday



[Sample]

[2 Chainz]

Preach
Mhmm
Hiiiigher

2 Chaaaaaainz

[Verse 1]

Okay cool. You got it? Then it's cool
Wetness all around me like a pool
You say who?
I say me, she say we
She a selfish little freak: every time she nut she try to go to sleep
I go deep, she go "hee!"
When she really say "hee!" she say "T!"
She don't like to call me Tity, she no me from back in the G
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, shit I'm hanging from the tree
Yeah, we doing all that monkey shit, that sucking and that fucking shit
And if I had another pick, I would pick the other bitch
Cause she more like the way I like em, and this one right here ain't shit
This one might need a quilt, it's cold on the other side
Her head so fire, I hated for them other guys
Pimpin and I'm mackin'
Actin in the 'lac' and
If you out chea working, you ain't worth Curtis Jackson
And she cost a hunnid, for some satisfaction
And I'm just relaxing

[Sample]

[Verse 2]

Yeaaaaaaaaah. I got a Chevelle with a Corvette engine
Champagne, bubble bath, Moet swimming
She said, "I don't know what done got into me."
And I said, "it was me when you was on liquor"
Yeaaah. Blame it on the alcohol. If you don't remember that, battin' your Nigeria Falls
And when I pull em, all I have to do is call:
I say come 'ere, and it's a lake in they fucking draws
And you late! Faking like a fucking broad
Hair hang like a London fall, just becau'
And the wind blow, I'm hanging out the window
Windtows, pistols, and all common essentials
If a nigga talking math, he talking my lingo
And if I say I'm popping tags, I'm talking my Benzo
I'm fresh off the lot, fresh off the block
What?

[Sample]



[Intro]
Yo yo... yo yo yo yooooooo... 2 Chaaaaaaaaiiiiiinnnzzzz

[Hook x2]

Started wit' a model, then I fucked her friend
Then I bought a condo, then I bought a Benz
Ballin' outta control we gon' get it in

[Verse 1]
Nigga ? bedroom try to play us on the cellphone
Ask me what's my alibi this big thick yellow redbone
Strawberry banana, we dance in our pajamas
And pose for the camera, making music no piano
Got keys on the counter, please don't get me started
Every beat I get on it end up dearly departed
Mack 11 shawty, Kawasaki balling
Tried to pop a wheelie and the Kawasaki falling
Money in my backpack, I'm too past that to go ask that
Fuck how much it cost, I got to go have that
Duck ass nigga, yeah... Aflac
And we getting paper baby can I get a hand-clap
Clap-clap-clap-clap-clap now I been booming out my traphouse
Nigga try to go and we gon' have to pull them thangs out
'Cuz I got them chains out, them charms and them rings out
And if you been hustling, then we took the same route

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
First I bought a Beamer, then I bought some rims
Then I fucked a model, then I fucked her twin
See I don't give a fuck, we don't fuck wit' them
I'm yelling fuck the other side, we gon' get it in!
Talking on my iPhone wit' that shuffle on my iPod
Alligator belts when I flow no Izod
Walking wit' my chopper, I might need a tripod
Make ya dog look backwards nigga... my God
And know that I hustle all day
And hang on the west like Kanye
And I got techs like Georg-a, in my yellow jacket
Bitch don't act right I get her a yellow taxi
Niggas know what happen when you fucking wit' the captain
Niggas know I'm sushi, I'm raw, what's happening
Smoking on that cannabis, drinking on that lavender
And I'm getting to it every day that's on the calendar

[2 Chainz]

My rhyme style real nonchalant
Trust me rude boy ain't what you want
Hit your ass up have you doing somersaults
Then I drop your trashy ass off in the garbage
Every week I get my car washed
This is the life of a hustler this is not facade
And what you looking at is not a mirage
You probably see me at the W having a Menage
Performing
Slap a little ass recording
Im doing 160 for my niggas in Porsches
They say I'm speeding cause im on that far left side
I'm from the south but im smoking on that west side
Im in my best ride
I let my girl wash clothes on the G4 so I can let the jet dry
I'm the best I know this
And you ain't even notice
Until I rode up on you in a Lotus
Brushing dust off my shoulders
Like fuck it im focused
Im fucking with bitches thats only fucking with soldiers
Now listen
I got a old school the color of Okra
The tires as wide as Oprah
Watching it when its approaching
Now listen
Peace up
A-Town down
You know I got that piece up so I won't play around
Got a extra round
Plus I got a clip on it
Pollute your block
I put all that shit on it
2chain!



[Intro]
It's Young Khalifa man
2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam'
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass yeah!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with (And no way around it)
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this everyday
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Wiz Khalifa
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside uh
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' off set
I look better on your girl (Than her outfit)

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam' and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin' one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

This moment we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live so here we go
This moment we own it

Bitch poppin' like bra straps
Only Kappa steps with a signed petition
Told the governor to revise the system
My auntie, she reside in prison
Damn near did thirty flat

Got all my people to get up and fight
Guess I'ma be the new villain tonight
Liftin' the spirits to Biblical heights
I talk to Christ so I'm feelin' him right

Stick it inside you, then I'ma turn you
Then I'ma learn you, then I'ma burn you

You know I look in your face, sing to your bitch like I'm Drake
2 Chainz!

[Hook: Chorus]
Good drank, big knots
Good stuff, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)

She said that molly give her thizz face
Put the thing in her rib cage
Whips out, Kunta Kinte
Diamonds clear like Bombay
Take your babies, no Harambe
Play with keys like Doc Dre
3K like André
And your girl, tell her come here

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
Your trunk in the front
Well check this out my top in the trunk
You play with my money
Then check this out you’re poppin' the trunk
Three mil in a month
But I just did three years on a bunk
Oh, you in a slump
I'm headed to Oakland like Kevin Da Runt
What is your point?
Score with the Steph, Fuck Kevin Durant
Lay on on my trap
Play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat
I'm taking the cheese and killing the rats
Gucci Mane, call me the cat with the racks
I'm swervin', but I'm in back of the 'Bach
Persian, man I got hoes from Iraq
I'm servin' I pay a bird for that
He nervous, I ain't got no word for that
He hurt and want all of his purses back
He mixing the syrup with the Percocets
She perfect and she got perky breasts
I just want some of that turkey neck
Trapper of the year, I'm from Bouldercrest
You snitch of the year cause you told the best

[Hook: Chorus]
Good drank, big knots
Good stuff, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)
Drop top, no hot box
12 tried to pull me over, pink slips to the cops
She said that molly give her thizz face
Put the thing in her rib cage
Whips out, Kunta Kinte
Diamonds clear like Bombay
Take your babies, no Harambe
Play with keys like Doc Dre
3K like André
And your girl, tell her come here

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Hey Mike Dean
Favorite rapper, that's 3K
And my DJ's up
Everybody in here
Want to show him some love
Guwop right next to me
So you know Bouldercrest with me
Man it's hard to kind of mess with me
Man you're looking at the best with me
Diamonds dancing like Bentley
Might leave in a Bentley
Kind of hard to get with me
They can't believe it like Ripley
Pretty girls like trap music
Man I used to want a condo
Started off in the basement
Ended up on the top floor
Man this is the top flow
Man this is the top tier
From grams to the Grammys
Told y'all it was our year
Told y'all this was my year
Told y'all this was my year
Told y'all this was my year
Man let's get up outta here, bro
For real



[Hook: Dre]
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Mind right, money right
Red flag, red hat
I’m alright fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right I do it for the money
And if I don’t do nothing I’mma ball
I said if I don’t do nothing I’mma fuck you up
If you fuckin’ with me, who fuckin’ with me?
Fuck with me!!!
And where will I be, without my E
Yeah without my street, and that’s Apple & Eagle bitch
Haha and how can I see
When my E-Y-Es are C-L-O-S-E
Or I-C-U N I-T, D-R.﻿ C-A-R-T-E… R
Or, R-I-P haha
Yeah and it’s M-O-B ’til I D-I-E, flow D-O-As since my D-O-B
Mr. D-R-E talk to ‘em

[Hook: Dre]
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come

[Verse 2 - Tity Boi]
Woke up this morning, feeling all horny
Picked up my pistol, fucked my opponent
The roof on dismissal, the feet are enormous
They on the same shit we switched up the toilets
I looked in the mirror and I said what’s happening?
The mirror said “you are, you conceited bastard!"
Well that’s true, the Coupe look like it came with the wheels
Because it got a paper tags still
And the passengers a pill away from being DOA
Down on her ass freak for the chips, Frito lay
And the waiter shorty move throw it thisa way
When the players hit the club nigga leave some way
Cause we as real as they soldiers in the field
Cause we fighting for something but we don’t know what it is
I’m trying to get higher than last months bills
Cause this months here, this one's clear
This one's brown, this one's beer
Man we got it lookin' like a bar in the VIP
The flow is contagious and deadly like Rabies
Had your girl in the suite swallowin' babies
But that is irrelevant it was all a pre-requisite
Nigga I’m ill, nigga I need medicine
Like Excedrin cause it’s this big
Broke my dishwasher and bought a new crib

[Hook: Dre]
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come

[Intro]
Yuck Daddy
Yuck Daddy

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talking on the FLX phone
Poof, just like that the whole check gone
Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun game, all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in her tummy
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black Mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that
Nigga I'm so dope, you could catch a fucking contact

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Good weed, bad bitch
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
Woah I seen it all before
The bitch gotta man but she scheming on the low
How it go, it go fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers
Codine, no liquor
Man life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I'm fucked, let's fuck
She said she on her period, I said yuck
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chain, one big chopper bitch

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got the chopper for the correspondents
The codine got me standing horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontases
And this shit is off the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, laying with my seat back
We next, weed never left Holland, weed bag
All this ice on me and my niggas playing freeze tag
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him
I come through with the yapper on
Turn that nigga into hot bologna
I'm the type a nigga cop a Rolly, cop a Benz, cop a two
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu
Uh, I'm from the trap where the block'll pay you
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato
I be like you could get her
He be like you could get her
I be like you could have her
He be like you could have her
He be like it don't matter
I be like, me neither
Uh, my old school got twenty-sixes on it
And I got you girl kissing on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: yung truth]

Uh couple broken bottles pain pills ecstasy
Place that pussy right here next to me
100 tho put that bitch on your tabs
Nigga grab his dick ho dont want crabs
Bitch taking time talking about her period
God damn im think im finish hearing it
Ballin white until I turn fuckin brown
Look at every ho on cornor in town
Upset stomach mind thinking yuck
She brand new she looks bad that means she ready to fuck
On some new shit you dont know about
Way to a toosite pop make a new fucking route

[Outro]
Yuck Daddy, yuck
Yuck Daddy, yuck
Yuck-yuck-yuck Daddy
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch



Based on a T.R.U. Story Album Art




[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Scream, what's happening
You know man, these people man..
Alot of'em, alot of'em going nowhere fast man
I call dat "treadmillin'", you feel me
They at a standstill man, got'em at a standstill

[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
Long nights, more white and foresight
Foreseen in a foreign with the fog lights
On a pedestal and you're frog height
Forever clever, napalm mics
Blowed up last summer off of the freestyles
Year before that, the plug was on redial
Couple years remove for the penile
State of mind: criminal enterprise
Individuals who want extra sides
And desert, so we gone need extra pies
Emphasize I pull girls like a exercise
I pull so many hoes I need extra guys
Don’t stand so close, shawty respect the fie(fire)
No sweat although the temp too high
Where I'm from, we feel the rent too high
She got me fucked up, I think the bitch too high
And I’m a southside astronaut,SA, that’s the acronym
Mauri's with the air bubble on the back of them
The truck so big, it go beep backing in

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, we got'em at a stand still
Like traffic, we got'em at a stand still
Young niggas from Atlanta, we’re on a mission
Feel that, that's momentum shiftin'
Yep, yep, we got'em at a stand still
Like traffic, we got'em at a stand still
Young niggas from Atlanta, we’re on a mission
Feel that, that's momentum shiftin'

[Verse 2: CyHi]
Since I was a boy wearing Bugles
Ran with the big dogs, never with the poodles
Eating noodles, being frugal, open mic at Crucial
Pussies wanna shoot you cause yo name all over Google
Plus they stuck in neutral, and I doodle when I doo doo
So I won't take no shorts, I want the whole kit n kaboodle
Martial arts flow, what I'm kickin is brutal
Fuck you busters and you suckers, you ain't shit in my pupil
Toaster in the kitchen, but I ain't fixing a stroodle
Cause I hang with street niggas that's still getting boodle
If I never knew you, you can't get a feature
Cause my words are beautiful, I'm Mona Lisa of the speaker
Me and 2 chainz backstage blowin Keisha
Witta black and yellow bitch, you can call me Wiz Khalifa
Or, shakespeare in his late years
Face fears to make the average nigga taste tears
Waist spear for my fake peers
You in park partner, I'm in eighth gear
I hear you haters hatin, I got great ears
Cause the ATL on top and we stay here, yeah



All eyes on me, this all ice on me
It ain’t about me having on a bunch of chains, a lot of ice
Or none of that, it’s about you
You niggas who got a bunch of chains and a lot of ice
You tryna see what’s going on over here ain’t you
Ain’t you? I know
Like I say man, technique, I won’t appreciate it man you know
You been working hard too dog, you know what I mean?
And people, they gon pay attention to that
And you know Imma stay down, keep doing what I’m doing
And eventually man, all the thoughts they gon connect, you dig?
Cause we gon stay down till we come up



I'm all the way, turnt up with my burner
Broad disrespect me and I pimp, pimp, pimp, Ike Turner
Came from the gutta
The corner with ma brother
I stood right by his side for the last ten summers
Smokin' on Obama and we doin' numbers
I just left the atm
My bank acount got commas
You just jumped on stage
Aka Lil'Mama
Ah look at these two chains
They aka retarded
Yeah, regardless I'm a keep on gettin' grawlers
And I pop her pussy
Like I pop my collar
Panamera Porsche
Panoramic top
Hang out the roof
Jack in the box
I got sacks in the sock
Packs in mi casa
You got chickens in your freezer
I got chickens in my closet
Still sippin' syrup
Even Wayne couldn't stop me
And I'm so dam high
An airplane couldn't top me
And my campaign poppin'
Champagne poppin'
Watch so arrogant
Pinkyring cocky
My broad got features
My car got options
And nigga I'm turnt up
End of discussion



Drumma boy, oh yeah, oh yeah boy
Warrup drum? Oh yeah, you feel me?
Oh, that’s what we doin’ man
Doing up on a lot of people
2 chaaaaiiinnnzz
One thing I know
These niggas cannot do it like me
2 chaaaaiiinnnzz
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Most these niggas try but they can’t do it
That’s unlikely
Know this when you see the work
You know that is unlikely
A replicated imitation, you can’t beat me slightly
You know soon as you hear the track
No question mark or might be
I’m bishop they buy me, I’m off the hook, off the hook
Got these niggas in check mate, off the hook, off the hook
Bitch I’m bout the turnt up, let them lamers burn up
Niggas ain’t got my work at the dawn
Hustling till the sun up
Continue to set the standards, rearrange the plans
Ever since I’ve been in, I’ve been stacking them brands
From a …off, like firecrackers, I’m too hot to tame
For the e way, I’m rolling out, just stay out of my lane
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
When I slow down they say speed it up
When I speed up they say slow it down
I’m money bound
I’m so high, I could eat a cloud
Mister child, y’all … your girl is so thirsty now
My man swag like … every verse is a murder trial
Versatile, style on top of style on top of style yeah
When I say I hop the I stand for eye lens
When I fly, no eye temps, when I land, I buy them
New clothes, your hoes, ain’t shit, I’ll buy them
Dollar signs my eyes lids, now I see the big picture
HD, flat screens, TV's, same size as Paul Pierce
And ain’t no comparing us, man we do it major
And if they ain’t talking bout shit
Tell them eat so toilet paper
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah



[Hook x2]
I came in a porche
I came in to floss
I got a phone full of dimes
I don’t know which one to call oh
I just know I wanna floss
I don’t know if I should cheat
‘Cause I love my nina rose yeah

[Verse 1]
I got a thing for my nina
And some things we did between us
Dem niggas acting dirty
We gon’ take ‘em to the cleaners
In a beamer with Sabrina
A daddy got the refill baby
Daddy in the chain game
He got it out in december
It’s a cold world fast brakes, no words
Even when I rap I have to spit cold words
Making niggas see my view Whoopi Goldberg
How could I get caught over if I had a chauffeur,over
Treat the backseat like a couch
Treat these other niggers like trap roll em' in
Throw ‘em out realest here
Rep the south know the ends
And the out being like I got 3oh 3 at my house

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m in love with the bitch we clicking like a lighter
Take her everywhere I go because I’m not tryna fight you
Every touch a pop off you make a nigga like it shorty
Here’s a show off you don’t want to see the hive
But I can make the car squat I jam my niece with diapers
I’m shittin’ er’where like a dog with diarrhea
I scroll through my phone call my girl from Tanzania
And yeah I got the porsche she said I’m on ‘em and it’s me
You niggers park back like you play the sellafield
I’m hungry I got a taste for a different meal
I pulled up in that 4 door , oh no
Keep the 9 on me Tony Romo
Pass the remote I’m on I’m ’bout to turn it on
I saw you on something different than what I’m burning on
I was on the corner when I first perform
Wave my hands in the air and told all the cars
Come on

[Hook]

Walked in Onyx, seen asses flying

Every time I see her, I say nice to meet ya
Had it in the room girl, underneath her

Met her at Live on Sunday
She was in Atlanta on Monday
Club going up on a Tuesday

But if I hit you with the slow-stroke
I bet that you gonna spend the night
I bet you find another flight because she just wanna love the life
Seen her out in Cali, man in Vegas she was at the fight

Still driving these bitches crazy
Forever got a due to the fact that the streets made me
She asked can she hit the weed, I said "That's ok with me"
But I'm still screaming "Fuk u pay me"
Fuk u pay me (x6)
I ain't be feeling like doing shit but counting paper lately
All of my bitches be wanting to have threesomes lately

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm in the back of the back when I back out
Wrapped like a man inside of a crack house
Everybody know I'm a fashionista
Trap jumping up like Stackhouse
Everybody know what that's about
Swag up to my forehead, Miami from a [?] day
Drinking lean on a moped
Inner shake down for some romance
Look me in the eyes like a grown man
Seen a girl from high school
Busting moves on a pole dance
Southside Atlanta shit
Might boss the world with some counterfeits
Tell a nigga it's sold out, killed the game #PaulBearer
I ain't packing for some more there
Long money, long hair
Long nose, leave you long gone
Stretch you out like a long chair
Fuk u pay me, kick your shit like Solange there
Comfortable like Hermès, drive a ho crazy #AirBags

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
You owe me mula, where's my guala ?
You ain't got it ? We got problems
Got to send my partner them shotters
I mean them shooters
In the club ordering bottles, strictly for the models
Throw a band's worth of Versace, get on one side on my closet
Fuck the shit out of little mama and drive her Looney Tunes
Play with me, I'll introduce you to the Gooney Tunes
These niggas trash, sweep them up, I need a broom
The bitch's nigga she ditched on us and then met me out the room
Showed up in that trench coat, caught butt naked like Robin Givens
Sexy pretty ass ghetto bitch straight from out Memphis
Scream out that droptop : "Fuk u pay me"
You better keep that Glock out, boy you know these streets shaded
Where the fuck you've been lately ?

[Hook - 2 Chainz & Skooly ]
Pull on the vallet and look like wings on my shit
Talking sideways put a beam on that shit
Ain't no Activis so I lean on my bitch
I brought her with a bad bitch, I got her fiending for this
All that I need is a gun, I promise to keep it 100
The coupe ain't come with no keys, not when you spending 100
A nigga think this is a disease, can't even keep it a 100
I keep it a 100, my pocket look so with the cheese
How many niggas with me ? I think it's a 100

[Verse 1 - Short Dawg]
Half of these rapper sucks, they nead a pacifier
Truth be told the other half are liars
[?] more will do in the foreign coupe
Rings on it like a appetizing
Got a life fresh where you've been
Nigga that's personal
I'm doing a verse more because the work is slow
Keeping it 100 like the purpose's goal
I'm authentic keep my car's tinted
Probably cause I got your broad in it
The way she walking got my palms itching
Money talks and mine is long-winded
The TRU up on my charm glisten
Got more oil in it than a car engine
Because niggas know I'm from the H town
So I'm coming down like a partition

[Verse 2 - Cap 1]
Making all of these fucking Gs
They can't even keep it 100
I got the trap bumping, nigga what you want ?
Probably put in your order
I got them birds in the water, that's on my son and my daughter
I made a half from a quarter, I might hit this helling business
Nigga fleeping pigeons, bought a Rollie flood at the border
TRU thats la familia
I can make a phone call and I get rid of you
You can't have this bitch; I don't even consider her
We offin' them pounds like Jennifer nigga
The trap phone steady ringing
Money count and steady spinning
I just put a pound of Lenix
We got this shit from the tranches

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Skooly]
Married to the game, need a ring out this bitch
I'm may go insane, I'm not the king to this shit
I'm a zombie, I want brain, i'll be feinding for this
Wooh, that shout never changed ain't no reason for it
Trying to get the lean out of my piss
Trying to get the Gs out my bitch
I had an uncle, used to smuggle, got 4 keys in this bitch
So many Gs in this bitch, but I'm not easy to spill
[?], I was the dope, I'm the lean in the seal

[Verse 4 - Kaleb]
When it was small faces, I was keeping it 100
Spend the 10s, 20s, 50s all I keep is the 100
My money here, don't come stop it because it [?] just like money
And my kilo like my car, yeah the Porsche do 200
I'm riding for all of my niggas, no car pull
Professionals with the music, we pros with the tools
How can I lose ?
I came her with nothing, go nothing to lose
We out there, [?], got quality music so how can we shnooze ?

Drink codeine for mornin' sickness
Your dad was a motherfuckin' snitch, so nigga, you were born a witness
Allstate, accident forgiveness
Say my name by accident, We actin' ignorant
Doing a drive-by while you playin' different
This that Me Time at the finest
You won't beat me or see me whinin'
I am gangsta like the Raiders cap with a Jheri Curl on the side
I like thighs & breasts, I hide from stress
I don't even know where my phone at
Crib so motherfuckin big, I don't even know where my room at!

[Hook]
Whip so fast they say ''there he go''
Bitch so bad, man, I think she know
Turned 100 to a mill, man I think they know
Ducking on the low, man, I think they know
I think they know, I think they know
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know
I think they know, I think they know
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know

[Verse 2]
I think they know it, if they don't then fuck it I show it
Blow it like you owe it, ordered a case of Moet
Y'all get to going back to back for us
All black like I'm wanted
Got your bitch zoning, send her back in the morning
That money coming, trying to stack it enormous
You niggas pussy, fucking rat on your homies
I think they know it, they know it, they know it
I got a plane that's sittin round the corner
I got some bitches here from California
Got on my chains, I'm lookin like a dope boy
These niggas don't want it, I put that on mañana
My chain into 100, my belt Ferragamo
Go to LA, meet the plug at Katanas
I'm still the king of my city and they know it
And I paint pictures with these words, I'm a poet
And I drop the top on my whip, and we soarin'
A 50 a check then I'm in it, if niggas stay with it then they get extorted
And I'm gone

I said "No Ma, instead I want a brick"
And i was slangin dope by the time i turned 6

No vegetables when my mamma served me peas
And no bullies jacking
Cause i was pistol packing
My whole team had free lunch cause i was trappin

Started off with triple zeros then I got me some Ziplocs
We ain't had no peep hole, open that bitch with a 6 shot
Pull up to the dealership, left that hit a tint shop
Left that and hit the jewelry store, left there with a wrist watch
Mama still watching Matlock, got the block on padlock
Used all my Gucci boxes, as motherfucking stash spots

Got a trap on fire, nigga, we was down a street from the airport

[Hook]

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]

Grinding on my Nextel, youngins slanging them bells
My uncle Joe the dope tester he heat the dope his fishscale
Back in the day I was rapping, the dope was shippin' through mail
2004 clientele, I drank my packs on the daily
OG smelling like piss and mattress, 2 for 5 for sale
I put Fochinis on my bunion, it's the key to my step
Ferragamo 'round my waist, I put handcuffs on myself
Fuck 12 pussy nigga, they can't find out where the stash at
Hundred gas bag, in the Audi hatchback
I started grinding, ain't got no where else to hide the cash at
Granny came home like what the fuck going on!??

My pimp hand, got these hoes breaking cheddar

Niggas screaming T.R.U story, like masseuse applying pressure
If that’s you’re girl arrest her
Ho get out of line, I correct it
Know this she was spears, surrounded by squares like a checker
Migo got that work, white as every decker
Shouts to Hector

Paid a fortune for the lean
Plus I’m clean, pimping in my jeans
Might kidnap your queen, bend her over, make her scream
She probably seen …

Puffing on that trash, you don’t blow no gas, like a Tesla

Party in my place, grab your bag and skate, Imma text ya
Told her : “Imma show my naked no affection"
Put her on a poles, no election, don’t collect it
Give me all my ho, give me all my cheese
What you mean, Pimping in my jeans
The chick of your dreams, I just kicked her out
And she had must have seen…

I might fuck her on the strecther
I might make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
And they sayin' Money tall, with this selection

Spraying it with both hands bitch I’m ambidextrous

So know the fucking difference
And fuck with one of mine
Somebody gonna end up missing

[Verse 2: Vado]
I sag too low, lift them up let the boom show
Leather dark red, the same color as Nuvo
Wrist hugging that Hublot, my pockets huge though
Denim TRU clothes, get worn out like a used ho
Polo, high boo, like "Hi boo"
Yeah I'm fly, cute in that hard top suicide coupe
Cannon on me while bumping that Trapavelli II
Sign flew, puffing on niggas, must I remind you?
I'm used to this city noise, of pretty boys
Fatter that Diddy's boys, Magic City wit Tity Boi
Silly boy, I make classics, Reebok 54's
With my whole crew, lo boots, like give me 50 more
[?]
Hop out the four-door with four broads
Look like The Law
It may be Juicy Couture, I bag them all
I had a mall, swagger tall
And I just happen to ball


[Hook]


[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I dive in that wet, call me Micheal Phelps
Louis logo, check a boy's belt
501s, mind on my money
Look at the tongue, these boots looking like diamonds
Pockets on Goliath and your pockets on a diet
OK, alright I try it, if I like it then I'll buy it
Except for some pussy, OK you're right, I'm lying
Cause if that pussy good, Imma motherfucking buy it
And yeah I'm from the city where these bitches get tipsy
Niggas smoke strong, on the phone and talk riches
Righteous prices, baking soda vices
And yeah I'm in a new car, and I don't have a license
Your girlfriend like it, I met her on tour
And every time she sees me, she calls me Ralph Lauren
Imma Ralph Lauren story, Ralph Lauren mansion
And when it gets cool
I wear my Ralph Lauren jacket


[Hook]



[Intro: DJ Self]
Dj Self, the prince of New York
As we continue to keep it quinning

[Verse 1]
From the Jets to the jet
From the nigga in the cut
To the one cutting cheques
So who’s the one cutting cheques
You know acid reflux
I had to throw that shit up and then
Straight out the alley way
Flipped the long cheque and ran off on Sallie Mae
Paddy cake, paddy cake
I’m from where you either own dust or got allergies
Playin’ polo, white tee, ho beater under that
With some hoes up under me
And the watch cost a quarter, keep
My music on and I’m a beast, these shoes on that aren't released
But soon as I got back, I pull right up in five flat
And he was not that
Might peel your top back
Pop that, you don’t need a car to get carjacked
Dump the ashes at the red light
Just left the barbecue, me and two red dykes
And you knowing what they saying, right?
What’s that?
That nigga luckier than a motherfucker

[Hook]
I gotta get away
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course, nigga

[Verse 2]
Back yard full of golf balls
Grandma crib use to smell like moth balls
I used to pray that they would pop off
Hand tossed in, drop off at the drop off
Programmed to be great
In a Caddy Brougham with my name on the seats
I used to pray till I was sleep
When it was cold I used to have to use my coat for a sheet
The oven for the heat
The dude that used to work on the plum and used to geek
Your whole style is obsolete
They say that money talk that's why you niggas never speak
And I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Fuck around and give life for the aggravated flicks
Cyber dust if you are textin’
They'll take that shit to trial
And I done killed it in Giuseppe
I thank God for the blessin’
Then I look in the mirror, thank God for the freshness
And I came up from nothin’
(So what you saying?)
It ain’t nothin’ but a comma

[Hook]



[Intro: DJ Bigga Rankin]
Don't matter how far the road takes you
Nothing in this world can refresh your soul like being home
But a lot of niggas done sold they souls and made the wrong decision
So they can't come back home
So they try to find another source but it ain't nothing like love from the streets
I cherish these motherfuckin streets

Life ain't nuthin but a G thang, switch lane, get brain
Hand down her g-string

Big bank, all I do is get bank
Niggas hating on me but their bitch ain't
So conceited, I don't think my shit stank
400,000 dollars on a Mulsanne
Come and kick it with a west side nigga
Ain't about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga
Boy you're broke, you can't even be a threat my nigga
When you're talking to me say it with your chest little nigga
I pull up on your set and make a mess little nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O's
Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, that's the presi' diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything
I said trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything

(Verse)
Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm
Porsche 911 with the carrot top
All gold scale, that's my magic box

Give me thirty minutes, I'll be right witcha
Got the hard, my nigga
Let me whip this here I'll get it right to ya
Goddamn, I'm turned up

Goddamn, I'm fucked up
The streets dry as hell, this work high as fuck
She want white, boy, dudes take it easy man
Shit I'd pay less for a pair of Yeezy's man
All I wanna know if I'mma bounce with her
Talking me to death like I'm a counselor
She popped a Molly I'm guessing
But if she throwing the pussy I'm catching
223 with a silencer
Gon' rock that shit with the flyest fur
All gold like Montana (Tony)
Hoes all in my phantom (Rollies)
Young done killed the gold remix
A nigga don't like it, God damn him

Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch

Even all of my hat, snakeskin all in my hat
Hit your girl with my chains on so that's gold all on her butt
Gold all on my watch, so big it's like a clock
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
This for all the DJ's that got this on replay
I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate
Several bitches in every state
I'm in Miami with Wayne trying to skate, my family straight
Ayo, ho 'bout to hyperventilate, I owe her one, we did a 68
I say hoes, my nigga, them ain't red bottoms, her bottom brown
I'm smoking strong, my nigga, I'm on loud, not Bobby Brown
That's souf side up in here, I spell "souf" with a F
F stand for fuck y'all if you ain't fucking with my set
Fuck with me and I'm busting, fuck with me and I'm busting
Every time you see me think about what it would be like if I ain't do nothing
Damn right, I'm stunting, damn right, I'm styling
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
I got killers watching, niggas watching, bitches watching me too
See I'm on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
You need to mind your own business, it's 2 Chainz and Trinidad (James)

(Hook)
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch

Pull up to the scene but my roof gone
When I leave the scene bet ya boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song

Everything hot skipped luke warm
Tell shawty buss it open off on a new song
Got a present for the present in a gift wrapping
I don't feel good but I'm trigga' happy
Bet the stripper happy
Bet the wizard had me
And I wish a nigga wood like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I'm fuckin so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down you got a bad atti(tude)
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big I told her look back at it
Look back at it

Then I put a fat rabbit on a Craftmatic
I am so high... attic

When she meet at the telly

Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
I paid a 1, 000 dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a 100k for a feature
Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, she get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck

[feat. 2 Chainz]
Ok, I gotta come and say 'whaddup? '
Make sure they heard my own right
First I get my dick suck then heading for a back ride
Turn on to her back side, then I put that pimpin riddle
Making sure she act right

That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy real good, I've been real good

Me, I'm from the East side, said she from the South side
On like a drive much, total visit my sight
Have to switch off my location, my house is her best nation
Said she had no fucking gas so I picked her up from the mall station
There she got that feeding pussy, I'm a go feed my need of pussy
Every other day I feed a pussy, never ever when I eat the pussy
Your hoe is my hoe
You can't go home with your hoe
Disrespect I cross the line, nigga I dull her
Life's candy, long hell or short hell I don't care
Big brushes, though, studio, everywhere I go it's all good
Chillin' in my ride with my bitch on the side
Stop talking, suck some, you're fucking up the vibe

Ok, I gotta come and say 'whaddup? '
Make sure they heard my own right
First I get my dick suck then heading for a back ride
Turn on to her back side, then I put that pimpin riddle
Making sure she act right

That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy real good, I've been real good

I've been fucking all night, I got a hangover
I am so fly, I need a land on
I don't eat, take you bitch when I wake up
Hit the door and then turn around like
"What you lying niggas talking about? "
You fuck with me, I don't fuck with you
Ferrari Coop, hot pursuit
Pop and learn and I'm popping too
As far this chains I'm rocking to
Share the stone I'm coping to
That's one for me, one for me, it don't run for me
Likely, no artifacts but a bunch of dudes
Bunch of weed and a bunch of lean
True religion, bunch of jeez
Gucci stole, bunch of gees turning head on women like a murder scene
And I do what I gotta do when I gotta do
When she's with me she won't answer phones
I do make a come to, make a kung fu with no bro and no panties on

That pussy good, that pussy moist, twenty two, she from Detroit
I beat it up, yeah, beat it up, in the mirror you can see yourself
First I get a head gang, yeah, her girlfriend ate it up
Got a white girl, there's no cocaine, me had just a weed dope
All girls there one time, I'm a pee at it and pee white
She out of sight, she out of mind, I'll rap until don't see why
Face down, hands on, beneath that she needs the cash up
He talked to finesso, my diamond cup, my lascar
Heidy-ho, I'm a smash up
We boast up till we toast them up, heard a charm about five honey
Nigga, it ain't no cost, but

Ok, I gotta come and say 'whaddup? '
Make sure they heard my own right
First I get my dick suck then heading for a back ride
Turn on to her back side, then I put that pimpin riddle
Making sure she act right

That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy real good, I've been real good

I jig me got me on test basis on my iPhone, said I'm coming over
Yeah, girl, that's cool enough
But you got a brain, need a bunch of rubbers
How many you need? Like one or two. Mother of fact, two are good
I'm a use any last one, cause that pussy is too good
Yeah, I ain't none of them other niggas
Yeah, I'm way above them niggas
She make them niggas drop a cup of jizz
Me and my niggas been escape for free

Halle Berry sequel made me feel good
I said okay girl that pussy real good

Ok, I gotta come and say 'whaddup? '
Make sure they heard my own right
First I get my dick suck then heading for a back ride
Turn on to her back side, then I put that pimpin riddle
Making sure she act right

That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy, that pussy, that pussy good
That pussy real good, I've been real good



Im infatuated with money and the hoes
So many tattoos im worth more than you niggas in ?drawers?
This is not a boxer this a four door, car so cold man you need to wear a fur coat
Four zips pole got me walking round slow-mo
Everyone saying you should have went solo
But they dont really no though
This is how we do it
Steal from the rich bring back it to the hood
Quarter pound of good, got my tour bus musty
Polo rugby your ho go'n rub me
If i was you man i wouldn't trust me
All this plain around made your ho fuck me

Me and my niggas 'bout to fuck the city up
I dropped twenty bands early just to get the Bentley truck
We walked in the Blue Flame, there was like ten of us
They were calling my name, they were like, "Tity Boi"
We were trying to lay low like we had some tint on us
And me and Cap 1 looked like we got ten on us
We don't have to rent no bus, we don't have to rent no tux
I know things was slowing down, but now things are picking up
You ain't whip a brick enough, your old girl ain't thick enough
And if you ain't got a mill in cash, you ain't rich enough
All these niggas switching up, all these niggas bitching up
Even if they was drowning, they know not to reach at us
Trying to make a speaker bust, riding in a diesel truck
Teachers tried to preach at us, but they wasn't deep enough
Only thing you had for dinner was a blunt and Pizza Hut
Only thing you had for dessert was a fucking Reese's cup
See, I'm the Dean of The Real U
My girl working at the spot said she don't feel you
I wanna fuck her and I want her, too
I need pussy rehab, nigga, what about you?
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
This is part two and I can't go no further
Until Gucci come home and put a verse up on this motherfucker
I'm out



[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, Pinky just died
See I had the dog for a long motherfucking time
Wipe my tears and gon' bout another day
It's Christmas time, the trap open on a holiday
I just found out I got ounces the other day
And I can't drank orange juice or lemonade
I'm a renegade, you need to rent a cop
My bodyguard is all black semi cocked
And I done did some thangs a nigga ain't proud of
Sold my mom drugs, told my dad fuck him
Had sex in the Caddy as a young nigga
Have you every made love to a drug dealer
She replied  'yes' I told her 'nigga please'
I'm higher than the first class winter seat

[Hook]
Riding through clouds

[Verse 2]
Don't know if you noticed the projects is gone
Walked out the church cause all the bibles is gone
Had a nightmare that all my rivals was gone
Well I'm killing this shit they can die in a song
24's on a new [?]
No top on but my business straight
More campaign mean more champagne
Condo view, I can high five airplanes
I'm Mister Old Days and I miss them old ways
I can't lie I miss them old J's and I ain't talking bout the O'Jays that did music
I'm talking bout the OJs that did it with a shooter, ya feel me
My girl on E, my car is on empty
I ran outta gas, I might buy myself a Bentley
My flossing to strong, my grind to relentless
Definition of repetition, air conditioning okay cool

[Hook]
Riding through clouds


[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
As I stand in my

You heard shots
I'm a money-making-holic

Bending over backwards

But I'm not islamic

And my bitch

You assholes, ask Hov



[Verse 1]
Don’t confuse me, I’m so unruly
My partner got a face full of tattoos, them niggas going
Cashews, they’ll aim at your hair do
You know I run this bitch, no track shoes
Just a pair of Ferragamos
Same color nacho
Pushing white horse and I ain’t talking bout Tonto
It’s messed up when your cardinal do the same time as your mortgage
All the same time that you’re hungry
It’s a different story, like a laboratory
But they testing me especially, like I can’t afford it
But you know I got the recipe, may I take your order
If you don’t buy it I can take it to the border
With it taped to the bumper
Tape no recorder, I ain’t taking no orders
Imma make mine regardless, in the latest garments
Shoes all arches
Don’t stand next to your partner if your partner is a target
You can get skeeted on, mink coat bleeded on
Whole crew deleted on, bitch leave me alone
See I’m on whatever it takes to get you off
So when you get on I never get soft
I like it when you ride it backwards, no Kriss Kross
And the dick costs, you need to use it like floss
Every verse is that cocainia
Me and my nigga riding with your ho between us

[Hook][x2]
Ooh baby, Ooh baby
Baby

[Verse 2]
Now me, I feel like I can do anything I want
My president the same color as my aunt
I fill a cigarillo up high till I dive
Put the pillows up, no sleeping
Every day’s the weekend
I talk Franklins when I’m speaking
I talk mansions when I’m teaching
It's no ancient secret, it’s deeper than a riddle
You got to get the S with two lines down the middle
And it’ll be a cold day in south hell if clientele can’t get a bill
I sell like sailor, suits get tailored, seafood combination no scallops
Tassels, graduated to a castle
Left the bricks alone, old phone I don’t answer
I do it for the dancers, they tell the DJ to go play it
They know when he play it they get money faster
Here you go baby

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Hook]
They turn the lights down
And open the curtains
And all the fans stand up and they start roaring
Go Tity Boi [4x]

I mean that’s what this whole mixtape is about
All Ice On Me

"All I do is me, masturbation..." Uh oh. For his new single, Canadian emcee Chris Varsity gets a verse from who 2 Chainz



Verse 1: Rick Ross]
C-note after c-note, put the remix on my kilo
Thought I wouldn't make it, now I'm winning -- Timothy Tebow
Fourth quarter, I'm back; fourth quarter, in fact
Fourth quarter, that sack; Fourth Ward in all black
I said boss and I meant that; advance, you spent that
Corvette so clean you'll think Bruce Springsteen rid that
Cars just like sneakers, just got me ten pair
Dubai, I been there -- but fuck that, we in here
Roll up and inhale, I live next to Denzel
Alonzo, my condo cost three mil', this shit real
IPhone and iPad, Air Max, and my gat
Left hand got ten bands; back pocket, four stacks
All I need is bad hoes, all these niggas gon' rat
Half these niggas working now, they knocked it down, they're going back
All I need is Benzos, squatting on Lorenzos
Stack my money tenfold, make this my new ten-four

[Hook: Rick Ross]Fuck em, fuck em, I'm screaming fuck em
Fuck em, fuck em, I'm screaming fuck em
Fuck all you haters
Watch me fuck all these bitches
I got eight different Rollies
And they all mint condition
I'm screaming fuck em, fuck em, I'm screaming fuck em
Fuck em, fuck em, I'm screaming fuck em
I got five different Benzes
This is my deposition
I'm screaming, "Fuck every witness"
Cause bitch, I'm big business
I'm screaming fuck em

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]'Migo hit my boost, 'migo hit my boost
What you know about walking in the Gucci store and they salute?
Chain cost a coupe, coupe cost a crib
Riding with the chopper, like it's my friend
This for real niggas only, I still bet with Kobe
Got a sign in my garage that say, "Foreign only"
Forces pouring, on mixtapes I'm touring
See my shit that fire shit, and yo' shit boring
I'm chain smoking loud like it's a Newport
Dad wasn't around -- my father figure was Too Short
New Porsche deuced up, two cups got juice in it
Two forks, two pots, I could whip it both-handed
My girl is bow-legged, just do it like Bo Jackson
Every beat I'm toe-tagging, charm big as a Volkswagon
Money got me sagging, it really doesn't matter
I run circles round these niggas' world like Saturn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]Black Foamposites, it's like we on that mobbing shit
Riding five deep and I'm as dirty as them congressmen
Sixty-two, without no tint; missing roof on my new shit
Ironic since my drive increased, my driver see the profit
Yeah, work, fuck you niggas, pay me though
Smoke that Mark McGwire strong, Oakland ain't no basic smoke
Shout-out to your lady, a.k.a. MMG favorite ho
Tell that ass the way to go before I show her where to go
No Canseco, and I'm switching lanes at one six oh
A nigga trees fine -- a police siren!
Woop woop -- nah, that's just Diplo
And you cute, shorty; let's get low
On the low, I'mma talk that jazz
Jungle fever for the night
Horny or white, that's Anglo-Sax

[Hook]



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
(and no way around it)
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this everyday
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, i got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it

My cellphone ringin’ every 7 minutes (hello)

My cellphone ringin’ every 7 minutes (hello)

Damn, Based God, look at that paint job (damn!)

My phone still ringin’ and it won’t stop, nah!
Think I’ll buy an extra phone for the extra guap
Phonebook paper in my pocket, homie

Quit callin’ my phone if you ain’t talkin’ business
I’m out here on my grind, chasin’ 7 digits

Drop this shit off, I need a pooper-scooper with me
If you was with me, all you gotta do is do it with me
If you act right, I’ll take you to the movies with me (get it?)
The work here so I got that phone call…
I meant to say that bird call
I count money every night until I doze off
Ridin’ in the Jeep with the doors off
Got them 26s, so I took the 4s off
If I put the jewelry on, we done had a froze off
I do it for the Southside, spell it with an “F”
And the “F” stands for “Yeah, you fuckin’ with the best”

[Hook: DOLLABiLLGATES]

[Verse 3: DOLLABiLLGATES]
Walk up in the club, lookin’ like a rapper
$30,000 all twenties, feeling like a trapper
We just wanna pour up that Ciroc, hoe
Why the fuck you think I brought this extra guap for?
A 100 miseed calls and they still text
20 bottles later I will still flex
My phone don’t get no service in the VIP
Her phone don’t get no service when she be with me, no!
We was bending corners in my Flying Spur
She never seen a car where the floor’s fur
My phone’s still ringin’, I can’t answer, though

My cellphone ringing every 7 minutes

Got a bitch named ... she let me fuck her in the car like Kim Kardashian
She wanna be a star

Big, big, but bitches ain't shit
Got a main but I don't need her
Every time we fuck I gotta pop it first
Hit the beneath for desert!
It gets worst, just watch how she ...
She dress big, she lives in the sixties
Every time she hear I got a new bitch she says she miss me
I'm a thug,...she stay up in the jungles
Every time we go to... she gotta rumble
Got this bitch in a hoover, I don't wanna lose her
So afraid to measure her, I need a ruler!
Got this thang to go to North rich
She argue... Gucci, but she can't afford it!

[Verse 1]:
(Yeah, 2 Chainz! Yeah. Yeah.)
Here goes nothing
I'm suffering neglection
Just failed the test and got taught me a lesson
In first place, steady second guessin'
Yes it's in my second nature, destination for depression

[Hook]:
I'm goin' thru it, dawg. I'm goin' thru it (x4)

[Verse 2]:
I use my mental, I don't use a pencil
Come off the top, comin' from my heart
Then I made a turn, straight off the lot
Niggas know my flow, straight out the pot
And the work, straight off the dock
Cross the wrong path, you'll be straight at the doc
Keisha started crying, "Mama pray for me"
If my nigga cross me, he a dead homie!
Erase him, cremate him, we made him, replace him
Replay it like a murder scene
And I pause it
On the part where you mothafuckas bleed
I bear arms, nigga, long sleeves
Ride rims in the winter, nigga, cold feet
Yeah, no safety on the mothafucka
Run in the bank like Jason in the mothafucka, masked up!

[Hook]:
I'm goin' thru it, dawg. I'm goin' thru it (x4)
I get a pat down, I'm goin' thru it
I get a bitch, dawg, I'm goin' thru it
Goin' thru it (x4)

[Verse 3]:
One blunt, two blunt, three blunt, four
One blunt left, somebody go to the store
Get a two liter, don't forget the cups
Just bought a eighth, 'bout to pour up
Yeah, and that's about to go down
Just rushed the cup and I'm about to slow down
Mr. Miyagi you waste wax on the floor
I ain't happy unless I got stacks on the floor
Niggas bet with me, racks on the floor
And since I been winnin' I relax on the floor
Feet up, and my iron cocked
Nigga not grown, they gon' get they mind rocked
Runnin' shit like a Z28 IROC
From the apartments, dinner I had sack lunch
An AK and a UZI, got tattoos to cover up the bruises

[Hook]:
I'm goin' thru it, dawg. I'm goin' thru it (x4)
I get a pat down, I'm goin' thru it
I get a bitch, dawg, I'm goin' thru it
Goin' thru it (x4)



[Hook – 2 Chainz]
It ain’t tricking off, it ain’t tricking off
This ain’t tricking off, this ain’t tricking off
Money, I got that
Hoes, I got that
Flows, I got that
Clothes, I got that
It ain’t tricking off, it ain’t tricking off
This ain’t tricking off, this ain’t tricking off

[Verse 1 – 2 Chainz]
It ain’t tricking, bitch I got it
Get em, got em
Spoil my girl rotten
Every weekend I like to take my girl shopping
Every day is Valentines, here go your chocolate
Money, I got that
Hoes, I got that
Flows, I got that
Clothes, I got that
It ain’t tricking nigga, figure we can kick it nigga
Serve some niggas chicken dinners like we was at Mrs. Winners
She winning, she wishing more women
I tell them girls to get in, oh hell yeah they get in
And then we [?], oh yeah we down to business
Right behind the tinted, zoom, no witness

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – 2 Chainz]
Checker board Louis, nigga you fuey
Spit at your niggas like loogeys
Your girlfriend bited, she might start chewing
That little money ain’t nothing, I stack mine taller than [?]
And urine, the presence of the Benz, I’m fresh up out the Lex
She got tattoos on her booty and I just got me a check
I told her bend over, let me see what I can get
Shawty said she had that juicy and it wasn’t and outfit
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – M Beezy]
This ain’t tricking off, but I be spending on her
And her, let me see you in that thong
Jimmy by the hour then I hit it then I’m gone
Straight to voicemail, she can’t even reach my phone
Me and Tity tag team em, all I know is bad divas
You can see them bad divas when we pull up at a show
We don’t wait in line, we walk right up to the door
With a bag full of money, tell em bitches let’s go

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I ain’t never seen a never and I never will
My baby mama can’t complain, she never pays the bills
Big money, big crib, my nigga big wheels
I go to the pharmacy, sit still until I get a refill
You’re now rocking with a man on a mission
Last year and a half, you know I killed them with precision
The last half a year you know I killed them with suspension
Every line got class no detention, not to mention
In the kitchen cooking up, while the look out looking up
And I look out looking down, we got the hottest trap around
I got the hottest raps around, as far as the hoes I got the hottest batch around
You can ask them, ask them
Aspen, fuck em in the ass then
Fuck em at the west inn
Fucking Michael Jackson
Beat it then beat it
Eat it then freak it
Peep it then geek it, your secret my secret
Murder 1 is the prequel, murder 2 is the sequel
Murder you in a vehicle, now it’s a burgundy vehicle
And I’m so icicle, that’s cold, low
Shoot you, reload, karma sutra
All the positions, stop, look, and listen
My style killing yours, it needs to be convicted
And I’m so relentless, 8 days a week
25 hours, If I’m hungry I’m gon eat
If you love it so do we, got an onion and a G
I got a girl who like girls and don’t like men but like me
See, it’s Tity 2 Chainz, it’s airplane swag
That’s when you get the rims before the tag
The cash before the bag, the mouth before the glass
We at you niggas ass, no we at you bitches ass
And this rap flooring, and we black balling
That’s because the card got black on it

[DJ Drama]
You see I been waiting
Waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment…
Is close

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin’ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don’t let ‘em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin’ for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon’ win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon’ get here
Pyrex vison, made more than I ever made with DTP this year

[Hook: Jeremiah]
Tired of livin’ day to day like everything is alright
Livin like theres one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
Waiting on my moment
You say you got that OG hell
Next time thats mine
Long as I stay hustlin im gon’ shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Just waiting on my moment
Bad hoes im shonin
Time came and I owned it
Just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touch the block I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that ? drop
With that roof off and my shoes off
On you bitch niggas, Real talk
Real nigga in my hood, who errbody gon’ root for
They see my come from that bottom
Where errbody get bout it
They told me get em, I got em
Now im here nigga like yeah nigga
Just rolls royce and Bugattis
And m4 this year nigga
If I dont grind, I dont shine
If I dont shine, then I don’ eat
Won’t eat, then ima starve
If ima starve, I pull heat
On all yall bitch ass niggas
All yall rich azz niggas
Cuz if I don’ make no money nigga
Im gon’ take yo money nigga

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Jeremiah]
Since life ain’t promised..
Live it up live it up live it up
Here before it come this far
Give it up give it up give it up
“I won’t” give it up give it up give up
Until I have it all, YEAH

[Hook:]

You leave your home for days and days
Yeah

Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeno
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tape worm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big headed my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi

Yeah, 2 Chainz
I might book me for a show
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures
I like math, all I did was add bitches
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours
It's not doggy style, I call it froggystyle
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic, plus I named my pistols
Last name Fuck, first name I Don't Give A
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start dippin' you know the procedure

You leave your home for days and days

All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missile
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you
Tunechi

You leave your home for days and days



So I let the bitch hang out with me right
You know word got around I was fucking this nigga bitch
So the nigga called me, he like "you fuckin my bitch"-
I'm like I'm fuckin her right now

[Chorus]
Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls
Told that bitch take your shoes off, look don't even argue
Got your bitch tip-toeing on Italian marble
They on that bad batch, too much pork around it
Shorty ass fat you gotta walk around it
Big body got ten of those
Cars, cribs that's eight hoes
Nine piece that's dinner rolls
Wild freaks, that centrefold
Hundred on my shine
You don't like it fine
Got ya bitch tip-toeing like Gregory Hines
Cashing out with that nina
Ten days you ain't seen her
She ask for it, I beat her
You greedy nigga you eat it
These ? niggas all on my dick
Princess cuts all in my wrist
Hundred rounds all in my hip
200 grand all in my whip

[Chorus]
Wet work, got the kitchen stanking
We call a undercover, a pig in the blanket
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Shoot you in ya head like Abraham Lincoln
Stuntin' on them bitches like Birdman
Roll the weed in white sheets, Ku Klux Klan
Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers
Playing with them keys like Stevie Wonder
All my hoes pretty, all my niggas brazy
We sell that white, sell that brown, call it rice and gravy
Call me Tunechi Lee or don't call me at all
Man fuck all you niggas, pause

[Chorus]
2 Chainz, that's your best answer
Cup filled with pink, I'm supporting breast cancer
I might do that walk for the 5k
I get paid every time I leave my driveway
Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors
Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board
Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter
So many acres, my neighbours stay in another county
Ted Dibiase in Versace loafers
All you talk is shit nigga halitosis
Ghosts, I pulled up in that pale thang
Got a Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain
On top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain
Goddamn!

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money machine at the bank, I just made me a deposit
Fucked that bitch right on the sink
Is it the pussy or is it the faucet?
I just left the hotel, never let ho in mi casa
All this designer shit it's like a crib in my closet
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
Man, all this fuckin' gear it's like a crib in my closet
My Nike shoebox filled with rubber bands
That mean my Nike shoebox is my ATM
Fuck it, I said it, I'm winning, downsouth MC Ren
I might buy some Timbs, or peanut butter MCM
Raised down the street from a crack house
Pull her hair weave 'til the track out
Treat the rap game like a trap game
Tryna make a yellow ho tap out
I got Dolce, I ain't even worn yet, codeine ain't even po' yet
I could spend millions of dollars, and still won't even be poor yet
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking poet, riding now, motherfucker Ol'Nat
A nigga wearing a Versace shirt, man that's a motherfucking throwback

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
Man, all designer shit, I got a crib
All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib
All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib
All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib in my closet
All designer shit, all designer shit, I got a crib in my closet, bitch

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Since rappin' turn to fashion I don't know what happen
Or mishappens
Matching turned to swagging, he exposed the world to trappin'
Picture poles and tactics
Ho, this that click click, finna' blow this backwards
Money, hoes and fabrics
Strolling past like ''fuck yo photo caption''
If ye ain't got it then you bragging, that's automatic
I see no need for me to Tweet, these bitches know my status
I'm the shit, all designer shit, got all kinds of shit
Got Prada around from 1999 and shit, bet you won't find the shit
I'm on my Anna shit, that's Wintour, it's dressed like, it's Met Ball
I'm in Vogue, this winter, the runway, no insta
Got a crib in my closet, Spanish chick in my casa
So much space in my closet, fit your crib in my closet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I got more sneakers than niggas, over 4,000 pairs
Most all white like the Royal Audemars
Got a crib in my closet, hustle every day, nigga
If you work with them people I'm unavailable, nigga
You smell like pork in Mecca, Lord be my protector
Second row at the fight, bitch get on my level
Larry Merchant my nigga, I got Holyfield money
Finger your girl at Coachella, gotta roll in that for me
You should see me in Lennox, I shop 'til I drop
Spent so much on the watch, had a seizure in shock
Wake up and ball, watch how I walk
Money all on my mind, call 'em lucrative thoughts

[Hook]



I don't like yo nigga he said I'm his sister he said he my mister he strong like some liquor I'm sweet like some sugar we are so different he said he want my body and all my figures. Yo nigga is so fake fuck niggas I do hate. a nigga don't know who he messing with a nigga gone be in a shake. a nigga can be so scared cuz a nigga don't know what he heard. you a fuck nigga that a fact,a nigga gone scurry like a cat



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block-ow, dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I take ya girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead ass rappers
It's probably one these pussy ass niggas, don’t try me I’ll pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my cup, and your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss you, head game’s so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I’m taking pictures

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, less I’m with you
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss you
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million fore they die
Wattup

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true, that’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out
And I say damn that makes two of us
Aww that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s whats her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talking they'll confirm
Go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keeping my cup full
So I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
We don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some
I’ll out rap his ass, out trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take him out, bring em in, them whole things
2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t
Went where they say I couldn’t (tru)
YSL belt buckle, ya’ll niggas sure is looking
Ya’ll niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy!

[Hook]



Paid $100 for some head, nigga, Say you ain't did it!
I know a lick at 4 mil', nigga, Say you ain't with it!
Now if we hit this lick, nigga, & you don't want to split it
Then it's bow, bow, bow to your motherfuckin' fitted, now!
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck!
I pull up in that truck, Pull up in that truck
I run that bitch over, call it Trukfit
And yeah I'm on my own, I'm screamin' "Fuck it"

Fuck it, I'm whippin' it crazy
I'm ridin' the foreign, I'm doin' 180
My chain so heavy, my brain so deadly
Type of nigga buy the watch & change the bezzy
They ain't never seen me comin' like this
Smokin' on that gasoline in the VIP
They need ding-a-ling for the trampoline
Cause all these bitches want to do is jump on the dick
I hop over fence, I'm offended by co-defendants
Drink codeine for mornin' sickness
Your dad was a motherfuckin' snitch, so nigga, you were born a witness
Allstate, accident forgiveness
Say my name by accident, We actin' ignorant
Doing a drive-by while you playin' different
This that Me Time at the finest
You won't beat me or see me whinin'
I am gangsta like the Raiders cap with a Jheri Curl on the side
I like thighs & breasts, I hide from stress
I don't even know where my phone at
Crib so motherfuckin' big, I don't even know where my room at!

Whip so fast they say there he go
Bitch so bad, man, I think she know
Turned 100 to a mill, man I think they know
Ducking on the low, man, I think they know
I think they know, I think they know
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know
I think they know, I think they know
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know

I think they know it, if they don't then fuck it I show it
Blow it like you owe it, ordered a case of Moet
Y'all get to going back to back for us
All black like I'm wanted
Got your bitch zoning, send her back in the morning
That money coming, trying to stack it enormous
You niggas pussy, fucking rat on your homies
I think they know it, they know it, they know it
I got a plane that's sittin round the corner
I got some bitches here from California
Got on my chains, I'm lookin like a dope boy
These niggas don't want it, I put that on mañana
My chain into 100, my belt Ferragamo
Go to LA, meet the plug at Katanas
I'm still the king of my city and they know it
And I paint pictures with these words, I'm a poet
And I drop the top on my whip, and we soarin'
A 50 a check then I'm in it, if niggas stay with it then they get extorted
And I'm gone

Whip so fast they say there he go
Bitch so bad, man, I think she know
Turned 100 to a mill, man I think they know
Ducking on the low, man, I think they know
I think they know, I think they know
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know
I think they know, I think they know
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know



Time in my life I was down so low, a mosquito wouldn't even bite me
I lost my job, my 4 wheel drive, I even got throwed out of my trailer
All because of one thing: freebasing cocaine
That's all my life was, was basing, nothing else
I was on that last lap, with that checker flag
About to wave me on into hell
But I got lucky
I got into rehab program down der in Redstone Arsenal down
Der in Alabama and with dem people helpin' me
Well that smoking white devil is no longer a part of my life
I can proudly say, that white devil is no longer a part of my
Life and I can proudly say, that today, I do not freebase cocaine
Now I'll take a drink, now
I will take a drink but I do not freebase cocaine
You know, well, I take a drink and I might even smoke a little reefer
You know, you know I like to smoke reefer
You know, it relaxes me and everything
A couple doobies, you know, just ta get you through the day and everything
But, far as basin goes, I don't do it
Now I'll do some toot now. Don't get me wrong
I will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything
And somebody comes up and gives it to you
Its impolite not to take it there
So me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you
We do party. You know, I will do some toot
We'll do, you know
On a good weekend there we call a bunch of friend over
We'll do bout an eight ball of toot there but we don't base
I do not freebase cocaine. I want to make that clear. I don't do it



Chorus
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Verse 1
Pull up to the scene but my roof gone
When I leave the scene bet ya boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song
2 Chainz but I got me a few on
Everything hot skipped luke warm
Tell shawty buss it open off on a new song
Got a present for the present in a gift wrapping
I don't feel good but I'm trigga' happy
Bet the stripper happy
Bet the wizard had me
And I wish a nigga wood like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I'm fuckin so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down you got a bad atti(tude)
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big I told her look back at it
Look back at it
Look back at it
Then I put a fat rabbit on a Craftmatic
I am so high... attic
I am so high like a attic
Chorus
Verse 2
2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly
I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly
I put it straight in her belly
When it go in her belly, it ain't sh*t you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
I paid a 1, 000 dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a 100k for a feature
Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, she get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck
Chorus



Lyrics will be available upon release!



[Hook]
They turn the lights down, and open the curtains
All the fans stand up and they start roaring
Go Tity Boi, go go Tity Boi
Go Tity Boi, go go Tity Boi

[Verse 1]
You ain’t got no money take your broke ass home
I’m on the cocaine zone, four cellphones
We make the chicken fight, like Roy Jones
The roof know magic, poof, be gone
New suit own with the valet with the duffel
[?] with a chauffeur and you barely getting over
If you see me pumping gas, take a picture, it’s a poster
Living la vida loca
Reloader, clip like a soldier, clique full of soldiers
Front line, untie you, put my Pradas on your sofa
I’m supposed to pose, all my clothes is vocal
Loud ass jacket, stupid belt buckles
Brand new pair of boots, I spent two Gs on em
And the boots got two Gs on em
I crunk your bitch up I had no cheese on me
Cause I crumpled my cup up with no keys on me
It’s big money over here nigga
Got the Tommy gun and the Tommy Hilfiger
Tell that bitch to come holler at a real nigga
When she see a nigga, I got so much swag it’s OD a nigga
It’s dripping all over my motherfucking pinion nigga
But this a process, the thought process
I dress like I’m in a motherfucking contest
Deuce

Hook



[Intro]
Last night I bought the supermodel
Got head on the way home
She left her other friends at the club
Got home, and I fucked her with my chains on
And that's ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh
(Woah bring it back)

[Verse 1]
Take your bitch like I'm the dog catcher
Take your ass to the mall after
Spa day, shawty
Kill that pussy, pallbearer
You from that RuPaul era
I'm from that hell nah era
Real niggas say true
Real niggas ain't you
I ride around with that yapper on me
Gun clad with my Glock up on me
Surround your ass with so many shots
You'll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish
My paper up, got your girl with her ankles up
Gangster boy

[Bridge]
She got her T-shirt and her panties on
She trying to smell my cologne
I can fuck her anywhere I want
I even fuck her on the floor
And thats ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh
(Woah bring it back)

[Verse 2]
I'm on top like a toupée
You on the side like a toothache
Box your ass, suitcase
I'm real, you ain't
Calamari, crab cakes
My closet the size of your damn place
You lookin' at a star
I wish that they could add space
I'm getting money, fast pace
My hoes gave my cash straight
He can't ball, castrate
She the opposite of last place
Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin
My girl got a big ass
Your girl got back pockets touching

[Bridge]
I want a dollar, I want everything
Balls out, I let her hang
Went shopping for a wedding ring
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane
And thats ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh

[Verse 3]
If you patch a weed that's ratchet
My last album was classic
Shawty on my dica
Backwards spells acid
She pop a P like a zany
She'll use no hands and no panties
She rock like nose candy
You fuck with me, ain't no plan B
I'm a D boy with a degree
I sold dope in my momma's home
My girl pussy deep (deep)
So right there is my comfort zone
Born alone, die alone
Mud in my styrofoam
She got on top of me like a stage
I said use my dick as a microphone



[Hook]
We the hottest niggas in the city
Where them bitches (Where they at?)
Hottest nigga in the city, where them bitches at
We the hottest niggas in the city
Where them bitches (Where they at?)
Hottest nigga in the city, where them bitches at
Where them bitches at [x3]
We ain’t even seen em
Where them bitches at [x3]
We ain’t even seen em

[Verse 1]
All I All I know
Girls start choosing I’m like alright alright ho
Do it all night long, and we ended on the couch but we started on the phone
Now we stay together, what we started at our home and
When I say it’s on then it’s on like a bitch
And I put it on her ass and it’s been on ever since
And I own own rent, and I own my own shit
I got a bottle of cologne that costs more than your rent
And I came from cement, we the hardest of the hardest
And by now you noticed we the hottest of the hottest
And I’m probably in my Pradas, or flexing in my Fendis
When we shoot it, we shoot it till it’s empty

[Hook]

[Bridge][x2]
Where them bitches at? (where they at?)
There them bitches go (there they go)
Tell them bitches no (no)
Why? cause they move too slow (slow)

[Verse 2]
I’m looking, I seen em
I like em, I eat em
I’m swerving in my BM, shoutsout to my BM
Gucci on my denim, Gucci on my womens
She fit that so splendid, articulate she winning
I take her out to Lenny’s then I take her down to [?]
And we go out to eat then I take her to the [?]
Yeah my trap going ham and my money expanding
We were dope boys and now we dope man

[Hook]

Spreading joy wherever he goes

See what these bitches looking like

Louie V is my kyrptonite
Take ya bitch and I give her back
Give her this and I give her that
Fine wine and lobster tail
Candlelight and Chrisette Michele
Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell
Fix her hair then fix her nails
Even pay a few bills
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal
And my whole crew ill
Pockets on fat burger
Going so hard you'd think I mixed the Viagra with the Soda
Staying focused
Black and white ice, polar bear
You hold her hand and I hold her hair
I pull her close and I put it there

Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me

Court dates Still Trial, My rep is a reptile

[Hook: Juicy J]
Fuckin' with my cheese that come with beef, like Rotel
Wildin' in the club, give us room, like hotels
And I'm pimpin' hoes so you better catch this wholesale
Haters wishin' that I fall off, oh well
Fuckin' with my cheese that come with beef, like Rotel
Wildin' in the club, give us room, like hotels
And I'm pimpin' hoes so you better catch this wholesale
Haters wishin' that I fall off, oh well

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I used to ride Chevy's, now it's Bentley coupes and Maybachs
From the Dirty South, fresh and clean, like some Ajax
Back when I was broke, all these hoes thought I was ugly
Now my money long and all these hoes slutty
Let's go make a movie, I do my own stunts
My money like bubbles, now watch me blow a hundred
A whole lot of drugs and some freaky snow bunnies
With "I Love Juicy J" tatted on they stomach
Let's go hit the town, smoke some Kush and get trippy
Trynna get high enough to do a song with Biggie
Straight from Hollywood to Hollywood, North Memphis
And what's the point of being rich if you can't spend it ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
AK-47, with the shoulder brace
First I poke your girl then hit her with that poker face
So many cars in my garage, ain't no walking space
Bitch I'm so high it feel like I can walk in space
Just ordered me a car that got a bed in it
When I get it I'mma fuck and get head in it
Ask me do I get it, you can see it can't you
When your girl leave me I bet her knees ashy
I bet her throat scratchy
I bet she call a taxi
You know I kill the pussy, toe tag it
And I'm always on time, but my roof absent
2 Chainz' charm bigger than a Volkswagen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I see why niggas out here hatin' me
Got that Stevie Wonder money, they'll never see
Whippin' 360 in that Lamborghini
With a cup of Dirty Sprite, poppin' beans mane
I don't handcuff hoes and make 'em my bride
Just take 'em to the telly put my dick inside
30 stacks for a gig
My pockets fat as a pig
30 inches on the whip, sit high like a rig
I got more bitches, than a dog catcher
And that Bill Gates bread is what I'm chasing after
Brightlin watch, with the diamonds, here's the whole (?)
And I stay spaceship high, I don't need NASA

[Hook]

Just like a snail, I'm close to the earth
Waves on my temp, so a ho gotta surf
Hollering rock when you're scared, go to church
Me and Slim Dunk in the club throwing racks
Go into the trap and I get it right back
Want 10 bricks? You can get it right now
Pull to the trap house, come to the back
Riding domestic with the trunk in the back
Riding in a foreign, so the trunk in the front
Sixty thousand cash just for me to roll blunts
Standing in front, blowing kush through her dress
Five grand just to see her dance
Ten grand just to see her tats
Jump in the corner and he smoking on her clit
Waiting on you, so he get it right back

Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back
Give a fuck bout that little paper
'Cause I know I get it back

In the club, throwin' money
I done run through me some racks
Give a fuck bout that little paper
I know I get it back
Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back
Give a fuck bout that little paper
'Cause I know I get it back

Get it back, get it back
Yeah, you know I get it back
Shorty say she want my name
So I bought that bitch a tat
I walk in this bitch with racks
Tell them, come and get this paper
Yeah, my bitch is made in Asia
And I'm icy like a glacier
Get your baby momma
Take her then make her
You date her, then fuck her
I fuck her, then date her
Everything is on the up
Like a elevator
Gucci Mane and Tity Boi
College Park and Decatur
Now I do it for the haters
Started with a Buick LeSabre
Ended with that Ferrari
Tell me, meet me up out in Vegas
Got so many acres
I don't ever see my neighbors
Niggas say they want a mil
I put money on the table

Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back
Give a fuck bout that little paper
'Cause I know I get it back

In the club, throwin' money
I done run through me some racks
Give a fuck bout that little paper
I know I get it back
Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back
Give a fuck bout that little paper
'Cause I know I get it back



[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
I'm Rich, like Homie
I got yo bitch, from my homie, (2 Chainz what it do?)
That living room, full of that paper
Used to have a little room thats a house and an acre
Call her in the kitchen room, and she fucking with the bacon
Chopper lift ya to the moon, fuck y'all thinking?
If I get her in the room she gon' suck my babies
Tryna work her moves, she tryna move the baby
If you owe me money real soon, then you better pay me
Me and 2 Chainz, Just like shoe strings, strapped like laces
And I'm too clean, riding in a car from the 80s
RichHomie, no new team, boy I'm a star like Macy's
Boy I thank god I made it, got a couple broads in the [Decatur]
I'm in the fast lane driving in the car going crazy
And I got your main dame, yeah the one you call you lady
First million dollars, the most important thing: saving
And if you wanna book me here my agent
I got eight pounds in an old car on old Nat from the skate town on the



I tried to give her everything she couldn’t handle
I like her good…
Maybe it’s me!
I’m so cold, I think I can melt candles
And while you’re sitting on the beach
Trying to get a tan, I just pulled a tendon
Boy, you’re so sexy, you think you got a mate
You smile when you like it away from me
You’re talking not two sides of your face
But I’m supposed to go, well I’m not OK!

Chorus:
I’m so guarded, I’ve been hurt, see
I’m so cold now, someone burned me
Yeah, I like you, I get you like me
But I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Oh, you got me guarded like an army grenade
Don’t hurt me, I don’t have what it takes
If you wonder why I’m going your shade
Your charades!
I like.. like rubbers
I like different kind of shapes, different swaggers
Oh, oh, but I can see beyond the face of a kiss
Oh, if something’s deeper I’m so …

Chorus:
I’m so guarded, I’ve been hurt, see
I’m so cold now, someone burned me
Yeah, I like you, I get you like me
But I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Oh, you got me guarded like an army grenade
Don’t hurt me, I don’t have what it takes
If you wonder why I’m going your shade
Your charades!
Crossing the line is something that I wouldn’t do
Me and your brother, we’ve been cool since back in middle school
And now I’m thinking beautiful, two crosses on the spiritual
I am counting dead presidents off in the living room
Feeling you my Zeus, yeah they call me Deuce
They sure are for seducing, introduce you to my coop
Coop, this is baby! Baby, this is Coop
Those deals acting shady, I put them in the caboose
The end to the end, I’m talking me and you
Who? Ain’t no I, I hit it for like an hour
Hit it like.. she won’t need a towel
And she like I!

Chorus:
But I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Oh, you got me guarded like an army grenade
Don’t hurt me, I don’t have what it takes
If you wonder why I’m going your shade
Your charades!
I can see your charades
Yeah, uh!

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Let's play big bank, take little bank
You are looking at a shark in a fish tank
When I'm in the kitchen, I make plenty cash
Tell shawty come here, she got plenty ass

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
First I back back, Louie backpack
Where's Paris Hilton? Where's Kat stacks?
I'm round four with this ammunition, my camo come from Tru Religion
Them broke hoes can't pay attention, your cutie missing, New Edition
Mr. Telephone man, there's something wrong with my line
When I call my baby's number, I get a click every time
Every line is dope, you can snort it
Working in the pot, I can make you do aerobics
I'm haterphobic, they mad cause I'm winning
They busy high and catching, mad cause I'm pinching!
All my bitches different, all my diamonds glistening!
My weed so loud, everybody listen!
They say it's for the birds, so I bought a kilo!
My Boost Mobile chirping, it must be my amigo!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
2 Chainz, you fucking crazy, motherfuckers know I'm fucking crazy
Fuck wrong with these bitches lately?
Bitches better get on they knees and praise me
Bitch I rep that rich gang, Where's Stunna? Where's Wayne?
That's red on my wristband, SB, Mack Maine
Tell Tyga, lookin' for this bitch called Blac Chyna
Take a nigga bitch in a hot flash, menopause hot flash
Yes that's why I'm crowned queen, and I ain't lookin' for the prom king
These hoes' careers ain't promising, killing these bitches crime scene
Oooh that's how a bitch do it
Fifty black trucks gonna follow when I pull up
Dick shit hit you in the chin like a pull up
My door so cocky, my door so stuck up
Oooh hop up out the space car
Bitches stay pressed, I call them a space bar
Man I wish a bitch would, hundred-thousand dollar engine, I wish a bitch could

[Hook]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Wait I don't even think these niggas understood what the fuck I just said
I said, hundred-thousand dollar engine
I wish a bitch could, like the little engine that could
2 Chainz!



The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

Tonight I'm twistin' 'em big, I'm poppin' pink bottles
Pull out the old school chevys and make the pipes rattle
Kev wrap the rubber bands, no credit cards
45 catch the cliques, no bodyguards
Call that my real nigga passport
Pull 'em out when them old bitches ask for it
I've been collecting paper, tryna stuff my bank account
With this pen and paper give you somethin' to think about
The diamonds shine and the wine is muscato
We ride shit from my garage, fuck a limo
My piece is 1 tenth of a dollar
She left her panties at my crib on the coffee table
I'm waitin' for the beat

The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

Tonight we're takin' the city and paintin' it all black
Drama on the soundtrack and it's all crack
Your speed exceed 100 down i20
We breathe and smoke in and out and got plenty
I'm on the passenger, tonight I'm lettin' my bitch drive
She here to buckle and the car commitin' suicide
Law enforcement on my car with cameras
Tryna connect gang members and gangsta rappers
Drug dealers, athletes and black actors
Get caught up, prostitutes and back taxes
Fuck it, tonight we're livin' like we don't exist
Time stopped like I broke the watch on my wrist
Somewhere you wanna be?

The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

What goes up must come down
And if I stay down, then I don't come up
Life a bitch, I got my hand on the but, foot on the clutch
On my new wonder, smokin' a blunt
Tired of all sililaquez, service squeeze
Still use a triple b for insominity
And please, if bein' broke is your disease
I took a test and passed and nigga I'm clean
Promethazine poured in the 2 liter
Got my gorillas with me, and I'm the zookeeper
See, you ain't seen it all until you've seen it all
If life a movie you never know when it might pause

The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, hoe!

[Hook]
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing

[Verse 1]
Pull up to the scene, but my roof gone
When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song
2 Chainz but I got me a few on
Everything hot, skip lukewarm
Tell shawty to bust it open, Uncle Luke on
Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping
I don't feel good, but my trigger happy
But the stripper happy, but they wish they had me
And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I fucked her so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big, I told her to look back at it
Look back it, look back it
Then put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic
I am so high...attic
I am so high like an...addict

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly
I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly
I put it straight in her belly
When it go in the belly, it ain't shit you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
I paid a thousand dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a 100k for a feature
Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, so get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck

[Hook]

[Verse]

Let me introduce myself
Tity Boi
2 Chainz and a double breast
Maury slippers, trap jumping like it's double-dutch
Cigarillo, newspaper and my ankles crossed
I play the boss like Ricky
LS-450, I let the whip park itself
Cause I'm a little tipsy
Codeine, cream soda and a weed odor
Yes, I'm a young nigga
Self-Esteem a little older
I'm bi-lingual
I talk shit in española
I been selling swag
Heard it, so i'm back, order
And i'm back, relax
With the dough folder
I'm straight crack in the booth
Leave the door open
Came with the heat baby
Cause your boy scorching
Dropped the safe on my foot
Now my toe swollen
Bigfoot just like Sasquatch
Niggas didn't know the Porsche
Made a sedan car

Fuck with me
I'll make you a landmark
They say
"Make a left right there
Thats where Tit killed that damn boy"

[Chorus]

It’s K Mc, bitches!
Ohhh, yeah
I’m balling like somebody threw a…
So much paper, I think I need a secretary
I’m filthy fucking rich, this can’t be sanitary
Money tossing, you know I had a hell of a…
You can hear it in my vocabulary!
And I live for the money
I need it more than a blunt from my vocabulary
I got a whole lot of ice and a whole lot of cash
Who everything around me call it…
I die for the money!
Real ass niggas, never lie for the money
…in my face, but it won’t be funny
When the goon went for your balls half for the money
Real recognize real, you don’t know me, nigga
Time is money, spent the century on a rolly nigga
Cause you gotta watch this bitch, and now these conniving niggas!

Hook:
Some of these niggas think I’m playing for the pussy
Getting the finger, but I ain’t palying with your pussy
I ain’t a killer, but don’t push it
Getting money is the sweetest joy of getting pussy!
I ain’t a killer, but don’t push it
Getting money is the sweetest joy of getting pussy!
I ain’t a killer, but don’t push it
Getting money is the sweetest joy of getting pussy!
I’m balling like somebody through an alley, oh
Going broke is probably something that I’ll never do!
Fall in love with the pussy, that’s real too
I drop the top and I.. out and I salute, at-cha!
I’m solo, take money won’t fall on
Car so pretty, I’mma have to put a roll on it
Fuck them niggas that total on me
Go rolling, new pussy, fall on it!
Turn it out, turn it on, remote control, homie!
They go suicide, tell them, “let’s ride!”
Eat the pussy, get them wet, I’mma scuba dive!
You got some nerve, nigga, rookie night
If the bitch wanna fuck, I tell her get in line!

Hook:
Some of these niggas think I’m playing for the pussy

And the language of your love, can’t nobody comprehend

Chorus:

Said you were flying like the world was far below us
You said there’s no way that I could take you higher still

Chorus:
I got news for you
I still got work to do
And you’re thinking that I’m done
That’s just when love just begun
In the corners of your mind

Your time for love is threw
I got news for you!
Uh, I got news for you, yeah baby!
Don’t you worry about me leaving, no, no, girl!
Ain’t trying to be deceiving, no, no!
You said I feel good to be true
Baby I got news for you

Chorus:
I got news for you
Cause you don’t know how I do
I got ways to make you smile
They never knew about
In the corners of your mind

Ear muffs from Neimans, Marcus
I'm like c'mon let's start this
Keep it real my department
Versace my garment, yeah
I don't give a fi'nuck
I don't give a fi'nuck
Make her suck my di'nick, till that bitch hickup
And when she call my phi'none, I won't even pick up

Started from the trap now I rap
No matter where I'm at I got crack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

I got cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Got that cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

Thousand eight grams in my b'nag
I be making jewels, work be moving f'nast
And you need to mind your fucking bi'naz
Get cash, get fat this will pay for tonight
New car, you are not me forget it!
I got more hoes than four hoes
I had a foursome for Christmas!
Let me turn it down my baby mama listening
Extra garlic butter I got Benihana issues
Trigga finger itchin' like it's poison ivy
Going so hard Viagra trying to sign me
I might get an endorsement from baking soda
Catch me cooking crack trying to make a Rollie!

Started from the trap now I rap
No matter where I'm at I got crack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

I got cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Got that cr'nack, yeah, I got cr'nack
Started from the trap, now I rap
No matter where I'm at, I got crack

Crack crack crack...

All I talk is crack, I can get the rico!



Baby let's roll away
Get lost in the day
I love that you love what you do
And just like any girl, baby I'll love you the same
I know you gotta go, the DJ is calling you to the stage
Go ahead baby, do your thing
Honey complexion
Body of a goddess
22s on the Lexus, named Alexis
By the way of Texas
Big face Rolexes
While she's undressing, man I'm stressing
She's extremely blessed
Extremely blessed
Give us this day our daily bread
If you a chicken head, go somewhere and lay some eggs
I make you, make your bed, take that head
Got a move that will break your leg, know what Im talking about
Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out
Our first date was the Waffle House
Different day, different escapades
If they dont like it they opinions like Escalade's
Everybody got one
Yeahh
She slow grinded the whole time
I told her have a seat, you sitting on a gold mine
Big ass, long hair, thick thighs
Eat Lobster tail like French Fries
Im the type to buy you a car for the fifth time
This skinny nigga doing big time
Oh wait, dinner dates I demonstrate how to penetrate
If you ain't wit it, then its elimi-date
Baby lets roll away
Get lost in this day
Say its okay
Come to me
Extremely blessed

Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Ooohhh Nooothing can stop me
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Oooohh Loving yooouuu
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Nothing, Nobody
Can stop me from Loving yooouuu
Foreign exchange, I walk in the rain, still won't get wet
Nigga flick up the flame twist up the game switch up the chain
Play peek-a-boo I take ya girl and her friend and do a switch-a-roo
Started with a nick and got a 62 it was memorable my plan is worth diggable
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube in middle school
I worked the trap no interviews just told shawty that I'm in to you I'm the
Type that make a old school a Bentley coupe turn one to ten that's what I
Tend to do it's an amber alert I gotta missing roof it was black and it was
Travelling fast I love you now I don't care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes matching bags let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags
If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back got a bad bitch with me told her
Hop in back my car speak she dark meat I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth
Velourz hoodie I ask em what's for goody if you are what you eat but I am
Not a pussy you couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's and all we really do
Is shoot a bunch of movies
Started from the bottom now we at the top graduated from high school and
Bought a choppa orville red and bocker bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl cindy lauper
When they saw me they used to think of dope but now when they see me they
Just think of hope Inspiration no infiltration them niggas hatin I got they
Bitches naked hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn if I was sellin swag
Man I woulda sold it to em designer sneaks leather seats they say money
Talk that's why you never speak every I do is a rest in peace wish
This highway to heaven had an extra seat rap game extra sweet big ass charm
Conversation peice
Million off rap but the trap was sweeter when dealings on the block all
Prices cheaper I been doing this since guess and fila they say my entourage
Each car four deep eight heaters drop the middle man to cut the cost they
Say my whole click cut from a different cloth and of course we pay the cost
With each block that we off ya take off and call back it ain't our fault
That ya lost ya lil bitch ask ya boy bout them forty he lost talk slick
Glock forty ya boss now you the president fresher than peppermint whip tint
Till six bond number nine flow wall street bidness bitch
Started from the bottom now we at the top graduated from high school and
Bought a choppa orville red and bocker bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl cindy lauper
Nothing in the whole wide can stop me
Ooohhh Nooothing can stop me
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Oooohh Loving yooouuu
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Nothing, Nobody
Can stop me from Loving yooouuu
