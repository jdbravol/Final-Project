[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore



[Verse 1]
Yeah, livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
‘Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

[News Reporter]
"Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight."

[Verse 2]
Livin' life like this
Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the {gunshots} in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance
'Cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
[Pause] — Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related



[Verse]
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I’m just not as strong as I once was
When we’re together lately I don’t even feel a buzz
I’m addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I’m wondering what I’m paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I can’t fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you been Jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that’s what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that’s all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can’t fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it’s outrageous
All I know is I’m living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don’t get me wrong, can’t forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won’t
I look away but my head don’t
I love it when you’re fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you’re everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don’t seem to understand
I’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you’re everything I crave
You’re the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I’m a king, you’re my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine

[Break]
Slave for the—
Said, I’m a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine
Nikki, Nikki, slave for ya
I’m a slave for ya Nikki
I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya

[Hook]
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone

[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I been working hard, I been searching for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
Cause lately it feel like I’m just not your sister at all, all
I’m sorry for calling and bawling, I’m all in
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... he left and he ain’t coming back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting an' selling that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinking 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga

[Verse 5]
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati cause then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son, bye



[Intro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh it’s like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show em how to act
I'ma show em how to act

[Verse 1]
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Verse 2]
I been knockin doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Outro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show em how to act
I'ma show em how to act

Hold up, let me get my mind
Let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

[Verse 1: Logic]
Just ride with a mothafucka
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucka, hold me down
Chillin' in a-gadda-da-vida, rockin' Adidas
With a señorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito
Whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off
Blowin' up like a molotov
This is war, everybody, ain’t no reason I'ma call it off
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright
In the studio everyday
So you know this shit about to be a busy night
Everything is al-, everything is alright

[Bridge: Big Sean]
It's Finally Famous over everything
RattPack gang

Yeah, day one shit right there

Hold up, let me get my mind

Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Oh my God, they plottin' and schemin'
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'
They tryna take my blessings away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got Champagne problems, and I order more
My wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up
Hype nigga, back-back-back it up
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5-0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game
And you mothafuckin' blow it out; now everything is alright

[Hook]
Hold up, let me get my mind
Let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

[Verse 3: Logic]
Whippin' through Gotham
Hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off ‘em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain
But I be killin', 'cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me
Probably wanna fight me
But I just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash, capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach



[Intro]
Jesus, Black Jesus
Jesus, Black Jesus

[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don’t know what's up
What's up, what's up
Yeah, yeah
Ayy

[Verse]
I ain’t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I’m just here to spread the clues
I’m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain’t ashamed to be white
I ain’t ashamed to be Black
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don’t know what's up
What's up, what's up

[Bridge: Logic & Damian]
Go on and let your soul glow
Let your soul glow

Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah

[Intro]
All day (all day), everyday (everyday)
We was on that block until we made a way (we made a way)
Day to day, man that's the only way (only way)
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Hook]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Verse 1]
I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kin, gotta get my son back
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you (you, you, you)
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes I'ma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it yeah
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away

[Hook]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Pre-Verse Ad-Lib]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention
Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

[Hook]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Interlude]

[Skit]
THOMAS: Get the upgrade?
KAI: Nah, man. It’s the same shit with a different title!
THALIA: That’s not true, Kai
KAI: What the fuck?!
THOMAS: Yeah, man. They didn’t just upgrade features, they enhanced her AI
KAI: So she can actually hold a conversation?
Thomas: Yeah. Ask her yourself
KAI: Uhh, what am I thinking, Thalia?
THALIA: Kai, I’m a program in the ship’s interface, not a psychic
KAI: Damn, girl!
Thomas: Yeah, that’s another thing now. She’s unisex
KAI: What?!
THOMAS: Thalia, integrate Y chromosome feature
THALIA: Sure thing, Thomas. Would you like a standard accent or something a little more exotic?
KAI: Holy shit!
THOMAS: Told you, man. The upgrade’s crazy. Thalia, revert last command and run simulation
THALIA: Running simulation
KAI: Man, what the hell is that?
THOMAS: Well, you can pick anyone in history, and based off a collection of data, it allows you to personally speak with them
KAI: Anybody?
Thomas: Anybody
KAI: Thalia, do Big Sean
THOMAS: Alright, let me get this straight. You can speak with anyone in recorded history, like Jesus, Steve Jobs, Einstein, and you pick Big Sean?
KAI: Man, fuck yeah! That’s my dog!
THOMAS: *Laughs* Okay. Thalia, simulate Big Sean
BIG SEAN: What up Kai, you lil' bitch?
KAI: Yeah, I'ma have to upgrade my shit

[Intro]
If you're dealing war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

[Verse]
Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
Cause shit is different now
It's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets
Y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album
I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday
With a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt
We call that champagne

[Outro]
Come some more into my sight...



[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capeesh, homie waddup!

[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down

[Verse 2]
I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mindstate celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they momma's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic

[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down

[Ad-Lib: Woman]
Mmmn, I'm thinking...
Okay



[Intro]
Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond. I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie. Shout out to Mac... Miller

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind (Sinatra)
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

[Verse 1]
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"
Baby what’s the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?
(Cudi what up?) It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

[Verse 2]
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That’s my shit!"
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit
Or while you cruising 'round town riding in a whip
One thing’s for sure, you better get all of your friends here
If a shorty like my music, then she a (Bobbysoxer)
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie yes I rocks her
The second I jump on a stage, I’m rocking it, ain’t nobody stopping it
Whoever goes on after me, I’m sorry, you ain’t topping it
It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

[Verse 3]
Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
While you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
I know we fight, but that’s poquito
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind



[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like...

[Verse 1: Logic]
This the type of shit they said they really wanted
So I gave them this right here, now go get blunted
Check my last album, all y'all know I run it
Flipped the script just 'cause I could and fucking stunted
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit my life is all about
Check the Forbes list, you know I'm ballin' out
They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now
Like oh, I think I know, I think I know
This flow, this super flow, out of control
Like woah, this shit like woah, I think I know
Like woah, like, like woah, like, like, like...

[Hook: Logic]
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted
From the young boy, from the- from the- from the god
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted
From the rap god, from the- from the- from the god

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like...

[Verse 2: Logic]
Hold on, let me bring it back
Everybody know I'm bringing the facts
And they wonder why I got it like that
'Cause I put everything right on the track
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go
I been living like woah, I been living, you already know
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake
And I'm showing where I'm going
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?
Like God damn, I'm like (oh God)
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook
It's another day, another book
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana
Coming with the stamina
Bitch, put down your camera
And live in the moment
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it
So what up with it?
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing
Y'all can just shut up with it 'cause I know
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...

[Hook: Logic]
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted
From the young boy, from the- from the- from the god
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted
From the rap god, from the- from the- from the god

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it...

[Outro: Jess Andrea,  (John Lindahl) & Logic]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It's been a hell of a ride up (It's been a hell of a ride up)
Hell of a ride up (It's been a hell of a ride up)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up
Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up
5-0 triple 0



[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay it's RattPack till my pulse flat
We keep it real, no false rap
I got four cards and they all black
Got four broads and they all that
We call that ballin'
Doing this is my calling
Flow is so appallin'
My phone off and she callin'
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?"
Penthouse man what a view
Fall back cause I'm coming through
With my whole team they coming too
That's real, too real
Mothafucka tell me how you feel
I'm too good for my own good
I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill
Number one, bitch I bet it will
Do the numbers I said it will
I played the game and I'm still the same
And I never changed just to get a deal

[Hook: Logic]
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin to something
Like it's nuttin, yeah you know I done it
Now there's no discussion
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into
Tens and commas
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
Closing million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning
Hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin'
Going places they never go
It ain't all about the money
But I stack it 'cause you never know

[Verse 2: Logic]
I'ma live life till I overdose
While they sleepin' on me, that's comatose
I went mainstream with my main team
You just mad as fuck you ain't come close
And yo next girl is my ex-girl
She fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time
So I can't reply to yo text girl
Bitch I'm back again and I run it
Always gotta keep it one hundred
All of y'all know y'all want it
Turn it up and get blunted
I'm like fuck the money, fuck the fame
I came here to fuck up the game
Gon' get it... I'm feeling myself
Fresh to death, bitch I'm killing myself
I'm gone, we burnin' it up
Step in the building we turnin' it up
Talking that shit, but they never admit
When I step to the mic I be murderin' it
And we living real good
Mainstream, but it's still good
I got raw shit, I got real shit
But right now it's time for that feel good
We call that ballin'
Doing this is my calling
Flow is so appallin'
My phone off and she callin'
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?"
Penthouse man what a view
Fall back cause I'm coming through
With my whole team they coming too

[Hook: Logic]
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin to something
Like it's nuttin, yeah you know I done it
Now there's no discussion
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into
Tens and commas
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
Closing million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning
Hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin'
Going places they never go
It ain't all about the money
But I stack it 'cause you never know

[Verse 3: Shy Grey]
Yeah, you know that we ball and we been going all in
Hold on, let me slow it down so y'all get the shit
These haters talk but I don't give a shit
Got models, bottles and the piff is lit
But we ballin', kinda like Spalding and Rawlings
On the road to riches never stallin
Got yo girl all up all on my nuts
But she do it with joy, no almonds, ugh
Living life to perfection
VIP that's the section
Presidential watch, presidential suites
You would think we held an election
It go Logic first then I'm up next
I do not converse I just cut checks
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse
I need to cop a hearse cause I'm fresh to death
I bet you never seen so much designer
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna
Swaggin is nice but first I'ma rhymer
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins
Say you spit crack homie we spit that heroin
Bring it right to your front door like I'm caroling
Standing next to me would be so embarrassing yeah we be ballin'!

[Hook: Logic]
Ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin to something
Like it's nuttin, yeah you know I done it
Now there's no discussion
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into
Tens and commas
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin'
Closing million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning
Hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin'
Going places they never go
It ain't all about the money
But I stack it 'cause you never know



[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, goddamn—conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him
I motherfucking kill him
I said I really want to kill him, but I can't
Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it?
I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can’t take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin’ with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)

[Thalia]
Hip-hop
[Part 2]

[Hook]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

[Verse 2]
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gon' remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you
But they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want
How they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs
Now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry
'Bout bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger
And better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me
They tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give?
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions
That shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending one must understand the prequel

[Hook]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

[Outro]
Spit it like Holy water
Prophetically repent 'em, then we gone



[Intro: Logic]
Yeah yeah, what up Bobby
Like goddamn, like goddamn
This that 9-5 shit right here
Take 'em back to the 90s!
Like goddamn, like goddamn
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take them back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind (yeah yeah)
See I'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah

[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

[Verse 2: Big Lenbo & Logic]
Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis
Better believe us or leave us
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, "woo-hah"
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man
Bitches want an autograph
I sign them titties in crayon, like goddamn!
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal
Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

[Verse 3: Logic & Big Lenbo]
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegle, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Beretta
You know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
"The Return of the Jedi"
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that, nigga—
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on



[Verse 1]
Living good, I've been living good
Rolling through my hood, understood
Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang, no, they know
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the fame)
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the...)
We've been at it way before the fame, sike
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue
I'm coming through
If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do
We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true

[Hook]
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)

[Verse 2]
Back again, like I never left
Had to take a breath
Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore
God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam
They know who I am
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce
Fuck it, make it count
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if I'ma make it
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in

[Hook]
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)

[Outro: Thalia]
Locations where the album were recorded include: No I.D's studio in Los Angeles, Logic's house in the hills, and various hotels across the country throughout the duration of the tour...



[Produced By: Dun Deal & Logic]

[Hook]
Tell me how you feel—
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna to be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive

[Verse 1]
Everything happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone
Perception of right and wrong
I been here so very long right here in this very song, uh
Look around everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don’t go outside cause it’s dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous
I’m so OCD if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me
Man everybody want this shit for free
Hand out palm up when they get to me
In my mind no I never let it get to me
Everybody got a time, will it get to me?
V’s up motherfucka, that’s victory
Tell me why what I’m doing ain’t shit to me, damn

[Pre-Hook]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know, I gotta know
It feels like I’ve been buried alive, buried alive

[Hook]
Tell me how you feel—
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna to be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive
(Let it breathe)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' this villainous feelin inside of my mind
Every time that I’m willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah
Listen up now,love it or hate it
Never debate it, you can never degrade it
While all these other motherfuckers
Probably thinking I made it
My mind jaded, no—I never evade it
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like Iraq now
RattPack put me on the map now
No, we never back down
Just take my time, I just take my time
I know, I'mma get it like this
So everyone know that I did it like this
Yeah, I know—I'mma take my time
Battle the image inside of my mind
I know, I'mma keep going
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing
I know, I'm gonna rise even though I've been—

[Pre-Hook]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know, I gotta know
It feels like I've been buried alive, buried alive

[Hook]
Tell me how you feel—
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
(Let it breathe)

[Outro: Thalia]
Outkast, A Tribe Called Quest, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and films by Quentin Tarantino, were in rotation constantly
Throughout the duration of this album's creation...



[Verse 1: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

[Refrain: Logic]
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood

Tell me you love me, need me

[Chorus: Logic]
Oh my, my, my, my, my

Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my

[Bridge: Logic]
Sometimes I can’t get you out of my mind
Baby, no I just can’t find, I just can’t find
Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind
Sometimes everyday right on time
But right now in my mind
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time

[Verse 5: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a...

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me ?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him



[Verse 1]
It's the type of shit that they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went 5 years without a publicist
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been at it way before the deal
Now the  music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
If I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it
Your cosign, I could do without it

[Interlude: Dria]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na...

[Verse 2]
Okay, last verse I gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day boy I thank the Lord
I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck
I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
I'ma intercept. It's my time
Put half a mill of my own money in this album
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor
Half naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window
Just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
And then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like "go 'head"
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for
How's that shit for an outro?

[Interlude: Dria]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na...
This is my story, 'till the end
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na...
This is my story, 'till the end

[Break: Logic]
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah...

[Sample]
Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them!
They may be misinformed about the truth, they may be misguided— somebody has led them on the wrong path!
A path of corruption and destruction! But yet, God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved...

[Break: Logic]
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah...
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah...

[Verse 1]
Call me Bobby Tarantino living on the level
And I'm prophesizing everything we know
Because of the internet

That's word to Gambino
He one of the realest, I swear he the realest
But anyway, back to the subject at hand
I just performed for an hour, performed for an hour
And made myself a hundred grand like...

[Interlude]
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness

Straight up, bitch!

[Hook]
I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness

They shit is made up, straight up!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it's that Flexicution, I want retribution
Y'all gone fuck around and make me wake up Lucian
And I don't think y'all ready for the revolution
Boy your shit is pollution, Logic got the solution
Motherfuckers used to hate us

Everyone know I'm the greatest
Tell 'em, "Title your album, A Fish Outta Water"
Cause that shit be floppin'—You fuckin' suck...
Number 1 my shit droppin'
Love it or hate it, they know the name
They know the name cause it's poppin'
Dropped 2 million on my new crib
Now nobody but God can stop us!

[Outro]
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness

[Intro: Logic]
It's 2 bars? Aight...

[Verse 1: Logic]
Motherfuckers wanna get famous
Bust guns and get dangerous (dangerous)
Daddy graduated from Cambridge
Money talks in every language
Real recognize that stainless
Silver spoon what my aim is
Y'all don't know what that game is
Y'all don't know what that, uh
Y'all 'bout that fraternity life
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come
Baby girl gon' be about that maternity life
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and alone
That maternity life for eternity life
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life
Cause we do what we do, but hold up let me get it right
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them, revolve them
Take care of all of them like this
I might just go crazy all the way
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away
But not us, mommy and daddy never bought us
Not a god damn thing but they brought us
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust
Outside run around with a gun to bust
Police looking for every one of us
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us
Had a little bit of money in the middle
Let me hit 'em with a riddle
If I never had a dark night I might not-not-not—
Not be the same—might not be the—

[Pre-Hook: Logic]
I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, it's over
I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, it's over

[Hook: Dria]
Ay, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gang, gang, gang
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver

[Verse 2: Logic]
Everybody wanna live lavish
A million in the bank on average
They cutthroat yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)
One day I woke up, and said I'm bout to do this
For the rest of my life, no question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light
Looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies, where the truth dies
And hatred multiplies—mu-mu-mu-multi—
Multiplies, I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no
I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen?
Stop spending money on things that glisten

[Pre-Hook: Logic]
I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, it's over
I Know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, it's over

[Hook: Dria]
Ay, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gat gat gat
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon

[Intro]
Aye, this that shit
I'm looking at you 6ix
I've been feeling like a...

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling like a mothafuckin' postman
Sending letters to the people
All this knowledge that I got, I'm like an old man
Hold up, wait now oh man!
Let me back up in this bitch
I'm platinum in this bitch, I'm rapping in this bitch
Running the game, yeah I've been lappin' in this bitch
You know it's alright
Fuck around and they all might
Look at a brother different, I've been at it all night
I think I said it but I know I do it
This for everybody going through it

[Hook 1]
Like woah
Through it like woah
Through it like woah
Going through it like woah
You already know
You already know
Gotta get it like woah
In this bitch like woah
Get it like, like, like woah
Let's go—uh, I'ma get it like woah

[Verse 2]
Back up in this mothafucka livin' like a goddamn king
Tell me money ain't a thing now
30 thousand feet above the world right next to the wing
Too high to hear the birds sing now
All around the world and back again it's finally happenin'
I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side
Bringin' out my best side
I was on the road for like a quarter I was in and out the border
From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry
Should've seen the itinerary
Then we made it back home like woah
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'
I know I've been illin'
Probably wonder where I'm at, bitch I've been chillin'
Why they grillin'? Yeah I'm still in like I never left
They know I had to go but then I brought it right back

[Hook 2]
Like woah
Do it like woah
Do it like woah
Going through it like woah
You already know
You already know
Gotta get it like woah
In this bitch like woah
Get it like, like, like woah
Let's go—Uh, I'ma get it like woah

[Bridge]
I get so high they wonder why no I can't go away
I gotta hold my own, know that's the only way
I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb, I'ma be here 'til the tomb
Lately I've been in my room
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall
Hold up—

[Outro]
Like woah

[Skit: Kevin Randolph (as Joseph Kai)]
Yeah I hope we make it to fuckin' paradise and not die on the way there, mothafucka...



[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

[Refrain 1]
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out of the window like goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, "Who are these niggas?"
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam
Oh my God, this is my jam
"May-December" by Mos Def
In my headphones, that's the man

[Refrain 2]
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

[Verse 3]
Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind
Be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit
You know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought
Hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

[Skit: Logic & Anna]
I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't like him because, like—when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie—
You mean like Inglourious Bastards?—I didn't see that
What?!—I didn't, I don't know—
Oh my God! Have you seen 'Pulp Fiction'?
Yeah, but I don't really remember it
What you talking about? Have you seen uh... this is funny cause we're on a train... have you seen—fuck! What's his name? The guy from the movie, in the place, on the thing?
On the train? With the scenery?
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit—'Source Code'!
No—You haven't seen that?
No—With the dude from 'Donnie Darko'?
Who's that?—Oh my God
Well, I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is...
My favorite Tarantino movie—?

[Refrain 2]
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

[Outro: Thalia]
The original members of the Rattpack include:
C Dot Castro, Big Lenbo and Logic



[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
I wonder what it feel like
To do that shit in real life
And now I know I got it
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
But it's still Visionary till the death of me
Yeah, I'm trynna make it but I gotta find the recipe
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me
I'm trynna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
They do it for the limelight
But I make sure my rhyme's right
Waiting till the time's right
Smiling at my mom's like
Smiling at my mom
Smiling at my momma
Moët what we sipping now
We was never tripping now
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now
Cause they was over there, I was over here
They was too scared while I was facing my fears
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers

[Hook]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 2]
They said I couldn't do it
Back when I was broke going through it
Till I got a deal, now they talking 'bout "I knew it"
But you wasn't there in the beginning
Nowhere to be found when I was down
But you show up when I'm winning
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming
I do it cause I love this shit
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-
And the whips with the rims still spinning
I been at it since the beginning
All these girls screaming "Logic"
But I wanna hear my real name
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man
Y'all act like I'm Superman
But I can feel pain
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane
Love it when they sing to us
Been shining what's bling to us
Yeah, over here
It's only been a year
I was dirt broke, now I'm balling like a sphere

[Hook]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 3]
Now that I'm in the limelight
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me!)
Shut the fuck up, ho!
Let me get my mind right
Cause this is for the fans
Who truly understand
Real all the time
All of y'all my fam
Shooting for the stars
And I ain't finna land
Giving everything I can
While they tell me I'm the man
Making music is the plan
Matter fact, you can call it plan B
Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy
And I be first to pop off -  infantry
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry
We all fam, same root, smokin' different tree
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony
Uh, to my ears
I love it when they cheer
On the road to success, these haters in my rear
I got nothing to fear
Cause the whole team here
And everybody shouting (What they shouting?)

[Hook]
You the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year



[Verse 1]
I know that you think this song is for you
I used to long for you and adore you
My life was just fine way back before you
Now when you reach out I just ignore you

[Hook]
Cause this ain't a love song (woah)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

[Verse 2]
No, I never thought I could live my life without you
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you

[Refrain]
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said, I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you behind

[Interlude]
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars

[Hook]
This ain't a love song (woah)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

[Refrain]
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you—

[Verse 3]
Yeah, uh, yeah...
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it
While they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated
I'mma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated
Bitch, I dominate it
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Not many get to do what I do, and now enemies
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone
Outside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise
Livin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love hip hop and I hate hip hop
Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break
Now, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game
We all people, all equal—now let me let off, yeah
Now let me let off
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em up—play the game, run 'em up
Yeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal
All the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?
Racism on television and magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
And I am, here's to the Roc
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop—shot
And I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap
I am, livin' like I ain't got it
Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it
Maryland 'til I die, but I had to get the fuck up out it
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it



[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"

[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna tell me what I am, what I am not
"You ain't black, you a mothafuckin' white boy
Shut ya mouth, do it right boy, a'ight boy?
Man, why you such a hype boy?"
"Why you always talk about being black?
Skin too white, nigga fuck that"
Everything you talk about, cut that
That door you trying to open, you could shut that
Grip the gat, yeah that’s how I’ma buck back
Tell me what I am and what I know now
All this prejudice has got to go
Life is moving fast, it need to slow down
Come and see me when I am in yo' town
Practice what we preach before it go down
Practice what we preach before it go
Yes, I got the gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the?
Masta deep down inside of me
The plantation deep down inside of me
Everybody fuck like sodomy
'Cause one or the other what it gotta be
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me
Unity for everyone that lied to me
Peace on Earth what I try to be
I just wanna spread the message of equality
And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"

[Outro]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other



[Hook: Logic]
Yeah I've been killin' this shit
Yeah I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah I've been killin' this shit
Yeah I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit
Yeah I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist

Yeah I've killin' this shit
Yeah I've hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah I've flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this

[Verse 1: Logic & (Pusha T)]
Let me tell you 'bout the young man
Matter of fact, I'ma let Push tell that
Tell you 'bout the old man
Had a change of heart and then fell back
Old man lived a long life
Walked around with a long knife
You ain't cut the white like Jesus
That Colombiana, that's mi hermanos (YUGH)
Look at the flick of that wrist
I'm feelin' like Leonardo
Let me paint a picture, I might need a bottle
On the road to success, I could feel the throttle
That Michaelangelo, hundreds in the envelope
Tight shit when I write shit
And that old man had a change of heart
Wish he knew it back from the start like goddamn
Looked around, seen his wife on the ground
Military bussin' bullets all over the whole compound
Soon as he seen it, I swear it, I mean it, my members go quicker than vamonos
He dead, she dead, he in jail
Everyone fallin' like dominoes

[Hook: Logic]
Yeah I've been killin' this shit
Yeah I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah I've been killin' this shit
Yeah I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit
Yeah I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've been killin' this, cookin' that
Killin' this, flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've killin' this shit
Yeah I've hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah I've flickin' that wrist
Yeah I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Simple logic
Clockwise, counterclockwise, realest nigga in the top five
Other four ain't rap niggas, I'm just reppin' for the blow side
Yuugh, that's coastlines, Panama for the boat rides
Worth billions, and we ain't even need Showtime
Just money counters and kitchenwear
Condo with a bitch in there
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!
The Rollie's been the trophy since Hawaiian Sophie
Curry over Kobe, we shootin' niggas
Splash brothers with the coca, add in baking soda
Goodfellas to my niggas (Yuugh) all Ray Liottas
Shades of blue, I aim at you
Let the sky fall, let it rain on you

[Intro: Lucy Rose]
Everything is fine, everything is so fine
Everything is fine, everything is so fine
'Cause I’m good, so good
'Cause I’m good, so good, so good
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, this is my life
This is my all, this is my all
And now I’m happy, right now I’m happy, but sometimes


[Chorus]
I’ma get up in your mind right now
I’ma get up in your, I’ma get it
Gon' get up, gon' get up
Gon' get up, get up, get up, get up

I’ma make you pray to God
To the good old Lord for a sign right now
To the good old Lord
I’ma get up in your mind right now
Make you feel like dying right now
I’ma make you pray to God
To the good old Lord for a sign right now
To the good old Lord

[Verse 1]
“I’ma make it some day some how” what you telling yourself
But you ain’t focused on what's important: mentality, health Everybody in the world only want one thing, what's that?
Infinite power and a pocket full of wealth
Its like ohhh I'ma bring it back to the basics
Nobody can erase it
People in the street going ape shit
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit
I'ma bring it back to the basics
I'ma bring it back to the basics
I'ma get up, get on
That’s what I been on
Fuckin' with your mind, tryna turn shit on
But they want to paint me as a villain
Even though I’m here to open their mind
Through the rhyme of life
I gotta open their mind and design the right time
To make a decision and get in 'em like an incision
'Cause I'ma hit 'em and give 'em livin'
They wonder what I’m giving, I'ma never give in
I gotta let everybody know
I'm in their mind right now

[Chorus]
I’ma get up in your mind right now
Make you feel like dying right now
I’ma make you pray to God
To the good old Lord for a sign right now
To the good old Lord
I’ma get up in your mind right now
Make you feel like dying right now
I’ma make you pray to God
To the good old Lord for a sign right now
To the good old Lord

[Verse 2]
I'ma bring it back to the basics
Nobody can erase it
People in the street going ape shit
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit
Why nobody wanna say:
I been living with this everyday
Why nobody wanna say:
Everything will be ok
I'ma bring it back to the basics
Everything will be okay
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway

[Speech]
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety



[Chorus]
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like

[Verse 1]
Real shit goin' on in Lebanon
But I don’t give a fuck, my favorite show is coming on
Hashtag pray for this, pray for that
But you ain’t doing shit, get away from that
Blame it on a black, blame it on a white
Blame it on a gun, blame it on a Muslim
Everybody wanna blame him, blame her
Just blame it on a mothafucka killing everyone!
Everybody wanna get high
Everybody wanna live life like they can’t die
Everybody gotta be right
Everybody scrollin', scrollin' through they life
I wish they would love me like I like they pictures
I wish I had bitches
I wish I had motivation to get money
Ain’t it funny, my rainy day would be sunny
If I had the vision of currency fallin' above from the sky
Fallin' above from the sky, listen up
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody think that the meaning of life is, life is
Everybody, everybody, woo
Everybody think that the meaning of life is

[Chorus]
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like

[Verse 2: Ansel Elgort]
Oh, I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard like
I know that’s the reason you turn up at night
Livin' yo' life, just livin' yo' life
Can’t nobody tell you how to do it right
Come away with me, come away with me
Let me take you from this world of insanity
Come away with me, come away with me
Far away from flying bullets on this killing spree
Oh, I know, I know
It’s hard, yeah, it’s hard, yeah, yeah
I know it’s hard sometimes
It’s hard sometimes

[Chorus]
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like



[Verse 1]
Living life like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back

[Hook]
Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

[Verse 2]
So what now? (So what now?)
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision
My division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say "what's your motivation?"
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy fuck a vacation, we do this for love, not no validation

[Pre-Hook]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

[Hook]
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

[Verse 3]
Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving
(I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know) (Lets go!)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it—but fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (Whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow (I know)

[Pre-Hook]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

[Hook]
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

[Outro: Thalia]
Making a single before your album is like putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shoot...



[Intro]
East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows
Everyone knows, everyone knows
East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights
No lights, all for this
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside
No ride in the wintertime, all for this
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this
X you out, you get solved with this
Everybody know I...

[Interlude]
I'm a slave
I'm a slave
You a slave (Yeah)
You a slave (Alright)
I'm a slave for this shit
I'm a slave (Yeah)
You a slave (Alright)
I'm a slave
You got to slave for this shit

[Verse 2]
Walk inside of Def Jam
Step on the president table and dap 'em up with the left hand
Cause I'm countin' money with the right
In a different city every night
And I'm sellin' records like it's white
It's another day, another flight
Paris in the morning, L.A. at night
What a beautiful sight
Now tell me who be fuckin' with me, alright?
Everybody know I'm livin' this life
Everyone know I got the baddest wife
This shit right here, everybody gonna like
Hold up, I know what I, know what I like
Tell me why everybody in the pipe
Cause I'm the only one doin' it right
I'm a rap genius like Rob Markman
Spent a couple of million on my new apartment
Down in Manhattan, that's a multi-million dollar view
And I got it from rappin'
Damn everyone nappin' on the boy, heh, shit
I'm not a mad rapper, but what?
I'm angrier than Kanye
Angrier than Kanye when he talkin' about clothes
That's a fashion line
And my last album went number one
So what that mean?
I did better than you, you, you
Sold way more than that pop bitch
And I dare Def Jam to drop this
I just drop hits
Check the Instagram fam
I got fifty-thousand people in the crowd, singin' out loud
Every word, that's every lyric
You can hate, shit, just stop actin' like you don't hear it
This shit right here for the party
That album that comin', that's shit for the spirit, woo!

[Outro]
5-0 triple-0



[Verse 1]
Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?
We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money—run it

[Verse 2]
What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating
They can suck my dick—run it

[Interlude]
I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in...

[Verse 3]
Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago
At the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people
But I take care of the people
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No, we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn, can you feel it?
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation
Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em
I'm too tied up, this a ransom—
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact, you should take a step back—cause I run it



[Verse 1]
Okay now, this how I'm feeling, lately I'm like the villain
Cause while they on that other shit
I been posted, out here chillin'
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin'
In your whip while you drive
I've been living life and I hope that you do the same
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
'Bout time that they know my name
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine
Lord willin' we overcame, it's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back
And I swear it's all the same
And what I learned; a prophet don't do it for the profit
Gon' get off, check the topic
Watch me drop it, can you top it?
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before
But I'm still here and I just hope
I'll make a difference, make a killin', Lord willin'

[Hook]
Lord willin', make a difference
Lord willin'—uh, Lord willin'
I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em—

[Verse 2]
I guess I'm back at it; I ain't done, I ain't had it
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic
Yes sir, I've done this shit before
Like your baby momma momma
I'ma tell 'em like it is, I'ma tell 'em like it is
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop
I'm well up, I'm way up
Nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way
But no not quite like this, living like that
In a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this, on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Like you listening? I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime; waiting for the bus
Number nine, through the city all alone
Not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing, maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl
Just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'
Make a difference make a killin', make a killin', Lord willin'

[Hook]
Lord willin', make a difference
Lord willin'—uh, Lord willin'
I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em—

[Verse 1: Logic]
Somewhere this shit done got crazy
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy
With my hands on the steering wheel
And my eyes on the pavement
I give a fuck 'bout where they went
I owe my lawyer a payment
They talking 'bout no arraignment
Now I wonder where the rain went
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressing
I been counting what's on my bucket list
And not on my blessings
I think it's time for a lesson, hold up, you better pay attention
I can't end up like my momma popping anti-depressants
My therapist think I'm crazy, well, shit, she probably does
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs
Shit, I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was
But I know who I am, yes, I know who I is
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy vibing with this

[Hook: Logic]
I've just been driving
I've just been driving
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
That Bino the realest, uh, this beat made me kill it, uh
Her feet to the ceiling,,she said that she love me
She never said that in college,,3005 is our mileage
I'm in my lane like a Prius, because I'm moving in silence
You still ain't broke down yet?
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left
Relationships look closer in that rearview
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you
So now you gotta stop, park, put that shit in neutral
Yeah, you really love her, but is she worth your future?
Your Ciara, your Beyoncé, they'll be saying he got money
Think that Kim be with Kanye if he left drive in the driveway?
Yeah, I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is
We were driving together, when we met we were kids
You ain't know 'bout the biz, I ain't know 'bout it either
I see you in that new ride, I flash my lights when I see you
I just be driving

[Hook: Childish Gambino & Logic]
I've just been driving
I've just been driving
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy

[Outro: Logic]
Turn left on West Deer Park
Doing ninety on the highway
We gon' do it my way
I said, ninety on the highway
We gon' do it my way
Uh, I said, ninety on the high
Ninety on the high
Ninety on the high
Ninety on the high
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy



[Skit]

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don’t know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki
Baby girl please come and get me
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that god is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man I know I'ma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, check
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that’s all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way, living day by day
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
Five-O with them K-9's
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police
Don’t know how, but I got away
Selling weed to my homies
And a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you?
When will I lose my anonymity
And become one with the enemy?
Tell me would I be the enemy
Feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

[Interlude]
Bobby what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what’s inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep

[Verse 2]
I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now
Cause when I wake up my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes
I wish I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen, maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live
I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how bout you?
I love you (I love you son), I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner?
I’m able to set the table
Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off
And I realize I’m back in hell (Bobby...)

Watch my back, so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me...

[Bridge: Lykke Li]
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I know we seen a lot of shit whole time we've been together
Thought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather
I think about you and imagine a house and some kids
And wonder if you found another and it's all his
See baby girl, I know you love me even through the lies
Cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes
Sometimes I see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl I know you hear it
My heart is calling for you tonight
And even though the time is wrong I know the love is right
That's why there's so much emotion whenever I recite
Anything about this angel that lost its sight
Baby you were my everything, but you playing games
Fucking around got me feeling like blowing my brains
But you ain't worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action
I used to count the days with you but now I just subtract them

[Bridge: Lykke Li]

[Verse 2]
You were my best friend but then you out me
I never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me
So in the end it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me
I know you hearing the emotion that's deep in this letter but I don't give a shit about what you think
I write it so that the people can feel better
That have gone through what I've gone through
Memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you
And if you think I write this song to taunt you
I don't want you, I want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday
And have an endless love with an angel from up above
But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
And another path within my life is calling
Cause I put everything below you, (everything below you)
Even my music, and when you left me I didn't lose it
I channeled deep within my emotions and used it
My heart you broke it and bruised it
So now I address this microphone and just ooze it

[Bridge]

[Hook: Lykke Li]
Watch my back, so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me...



[Verse 1]
(I, am the greatest)
Fuck 'em, I will never love 'em; I'm way up
Bitch you know I been above 'em; I stay up
Steppin' to me tryna talk it out
Knowin' goddamn well
There ain't a fuckin' thing to talk about
Hol' up, bring it back now
That ain't no way to react now
You was talkin' all that shit
But where it's at now? Huh? Where it's at?

[Hook]
(I, am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup; you get none
Like wassup, motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, from me, like wassup
(I, am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup; you get none
Wassup, motherfuckers get no love, from me

[Verse 2]
Okay now, what the fuck they talkin' 'bout?
It's like they never heard the words
That came up out my mouth
It’s like they just wanna discredit what I’m all about
I be in the studio, the motherfuckers fallin' out
Yeah, you know we balling out, peace and love
I represent all of the above (I, am the greatest)
You fuck bitches and get money, that's wassup
It's all good, but all these people do not give a fuck
And now I bet they bitchin' cause my flow switchin'
Tryna tell me what to write, up on some fan-fiction
Can't they just be happy I no longer have to face eviction?
That I'm livin' out my life
I'm livin' out my inner vision right now
I be on my Big L braggadocios rap shit
I could flow on anything from Premo to that trap shit
Sellin' out shows, I'm on that shit
Late night, dark night; crowd going batshit

[Hook]
(I, am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup; you get none
Like wassup, motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, from me, like wassup
(I, am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup; you get none
Wassup, motherfuckers get no love, from me
(I, am the greatest)

[Outro]
From me
Like wassup
Like wassup
(I, am the greatest)



[Hook 1]
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

[Verse 1]
You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams?
I know I'mma do it, go get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money
Don't make me mention
That it'll cost nothin' but time for you to pay attention
Now don't get me wrong
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative
Talk all you want about me homie, I'mma let it live
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative

[Hook 2]
Never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to everyone that never made it
And the people that persevered even though they was hated
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
But on the real the road to success is prone to collision
And every now and then something happens
That's unexpected, like that newborn in your life
Because you fuckin' unprotected
And I swear nobody perfect, hell I know I ain't
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow
Teach 'em everything I know
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one

[Hook 1]
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right you
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

[Outro]
Um, you like that take? I like it
Yeah, should I make it more surreal though, or...
I think it's good, hey Bobby run it!



[Intro]
Get ‘em!

[Verse 1]
Living life on the East Coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunnit with you
It ain’t about that; ain’t about Hip Hop, ain’t about Rap
Take a minute, hold up, wait, now use your cap
Chicago, know I’mma snap
Nah, this ain't no basic rap

[Hook 1]
And so they wonder who am I—so high (so high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

[Verse 2]
Back again, never outside so I’m acting in
I laugh again when they don’t understand
What I mean, bias; everybody seen by us
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Man fuck that, do what’s good for your family
Make music like there’s no Grammy
For that last line they might ban me
I don’t give a fuck though
'Cause I am me, from Beijing to Miami
I’mma just do what I do with my crew
Ain’t no telling what I’m finna do
But I promise that I’mma keep writing for you
And I know what to do, everything right here for you
Only for you, depending on what you gon' do
It’s all for you—it’s all for you

[Hook 2]
Who am I—so high (so high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

[Verse 3]
Let me take this time to find the rhyme
And know that I’m the only one
To find the one, the time is done
Beyond the sky, beyond the sun
There is no one besides the only one
And you know I gotta let ‘em know
If you love it, let it go
At an all time low and all I know is, all I know
I do what I love, came from below and then rose up above
Created a world no one has been to
Everything that I’m into, everything that I’ve been through
Bring it back like, let it shine like a Bat Light
Reminiscing on that night, gotta take flight
Everybody probably wonder what I’m living like
In the middle of the night I might write
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder (wonder)

[Hook 2]
Who am I—so high (so high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

[Sample: Alan Watts]
We’d like to be painters, we’d like to be poets. We’d like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can’t earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uhm—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...

You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn’t matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...

But, it’s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don’t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, we’re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up "their" children, to do the same thing. So, it’s all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it’s so important to consider this question...

"What do I desire?"

[THOMAS:]
You know in—in Pulp Fiction I mean—the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it’s the same feel for me with his raps you know? There’s thought behind it...

[KAI:]
No, I could see that, I could see that but...
But nah man, fuck that man! Kill Bill was the shit!!
Especially like knives throwing and dodging and shit—and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other’s heads off! What the fuck is that?!

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Church, yeah
Now this that—
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Logic]
Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good
No ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda
Gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait
Now take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin
Based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
What the fuck done happened to the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed watch 'em grow and then watch 'em lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

[Hook 1: Jesse Boykins III]
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
[Part 2]

[Verse 2: Logic]
I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck—
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Koolaid
Gettin' big wig money, that's toupée
Look around and see people with no class
Like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it
Yeah, I be pacing, bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when
Now let that shit begin, yeah

[Hook 2: Logic]
This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

[Verse 3: Logic]
This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming "I knew it!"
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems
Understand, this is all I ever wanted
Yes, I do it for the fans and I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

[Hook 2: Logic]
This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise



[Verse 1]
Various listeners is wishing us death
Don't give a damn, I'm reppin' Young Sinatra till my last breath
Easily my darkest confession is lyrical agression
Through indiscretion that triggers anti-depression
When addressin' my profession in every session
The fact that I'm alive is such a blessing
Sippin' wine while these honeys undressin'
What I'm about to say is highly confidential
And in the music industry today, very essential
So bust out your pencil, you can do it on your own
Stop thinking that these labels is the ones that put you on
Let's change the topic, who's your favorite rapper?
I'm the top pick, ha
The flow is elegant, never irrelevant
How many times must I say this?
Cock back and spray this, never delay this
I pray this, reaches the masses
And spread like cancer on they asses
Now allow me to catch wreck, bust rhymes like tech
Put me in your box and I destroy the deck

[Hook]
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

[Verse 2]
Whipin' through Cabo in a Murcielago
Dodging paparazzi with the finest dime I met in Chicago
The baddest Bobby soxer that you ever seen, reppin' my team
We real all the time, so my squad keen, bing
Dave, it's me Sinatra and my boy Dean
The way we (winning) I can't believe there isn't a Sheen
And pregnant women listen and they give birth to a fiend
I spit narcotic epidemic all up in your genes
In layman's terms I disperse a verse you never seen
Assassinate rappers the moment that they intervene
While you in the alley playing dice
I'm in the yacht contemplating plans for the next diamond heist
Art thieves and jewel connoisseurs
I study every part of they mind and make my rhyme better than yours
Elevated by being hated, sleeping on the brother like they heavily sedated
Some say I'm one in a million, I say I'm one of a kind
Only cocky when I rhyme, I'm Muhammad in his prime

[Hook]
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

[Verse 3]
Yo, Address the mic and start spillin' like I hit the vein
Back in the day they used to sleep on me like Tryptophan
Touchdown now the city screamin' my name
I flow gunshots and break fingers just to shift the pain
Whoever hate ‘em, I levitate 'em like David Blaine
Black Ops state of mind, play the game like campaign
Bumpin' Santana in a finest Copacabana
In Havana with a honey by the name of Hannah
Wearing nothing but a bandana
Pussy wetter than Louisiana
You know the deal, peace to Miilkbone, I keep it real
Flyer than a man of steel, motherfucker how you feel, It's Logic

[Outro: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day, I’m 20, it’s a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body
Now I’m fresh and my physical frame is celebrated
Cause I made it one quarter through life
Some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it’s pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don’t go against the grain, simple and plain)



[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

[Verse 1]
Fight the power, fight the power
Fight for the right to get up and say fuck white power
Everybody come and get up, get on
And no matter what you fighting for I promise that it’ll live on
Like make America great again
Make it hate again
Make it white
Make everybody fight
Fuck that
Street’s disciple
My raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like Cobain
And everybody wonder why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane

[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
The world going mad over one drug
I'm filling up a bag at the gun club
In the shadow of a nation that it once was
All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the high castle in a hot tub
We locked in a pine casket, it's botched up
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury
The way they can plead the fifth to the 13th
And stop to search me, controversy
Them boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker

[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Young blood, it takes another look and feel
Slap that fear monger at that wheel
Olive branches in the arrow seal
Alternative facts mean to lie and steal
Gotta to go to ban the whole
Refugee population from the land they stole
In the name of the government
Rich white man while the rest be suffering
Run from the locked down borders
Ain’t like Flint ain’t got clean water
Dirty politics never come clean
Can ya'll believe this shit in 2017?

[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my dick

[Verse 4: Logic]
George bush don't care about black people
2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so
Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 20/20 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that’s white and red
I know some people wish I’d act white instead
Say I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don’t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don’t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I’ma tell you what I need right now
I’ma tell you what we all need
I need my people of color...
Don’t run from Trump, run against him

[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

[Bridge: Logic]
Ohh, hands up for the 5-0
Oh, ohh, hands up for the 5-0

[Verse 5: Logic & Big Lenbo]
I been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck
I don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a damn
I just wanna live, I just wanna eat
But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh
Dope in the trunk
Creepin out the cut
9 by the gut
Never get enough
I don’t give a fuck
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards
Mastered the hustle
Something in the duffle for you bastards
Grind over chatter
Cheese on my mind like a packer
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K
Middle of the day, like that shit’s okay
Never had a job, never had a education
Only know probation
Never had a job never had a education
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one

[Interlude: No I.D. & Logic]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now send the blacks back to Africa
Build a wall for the Mexicans
Send the whites back to Europe
Give the land to the Native American
Take the skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo
Take the skyscraper
Take the skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo
And bear down on the, down on the, down on the
Take the skyscraper
The skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo
Bear down on the, down on the...

[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my



[Verse 1: Logic]
Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time
I think about specific moments that I could rewind
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide
And truly understand the deeper things
That I don't know about
Now take a trip with me and vibe
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now
Here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
All different colors and creed all come together for me
Boy, I'm blessed to be free

[Chorus: Lucy Rose]
This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

[Verse 2: Logic]
Doing 70 on this highway
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever
My endeavor like a feature film
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing
When I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie
That's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned
And I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies
On a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times
I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem
To stomach all of the beef around my way
I mean, I never wanted to live a life
Where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more
And so they wonder why, I said they wonder why

[Chorus: Lucy Rose]
This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

[Skit]
So what do you think about space?
Um, space is called the galaxy...
Do you know planets?
What are—can you name some planets off?
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth
Mars—and the planet Paradise
You've never been there before?
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space—
But there was droid ships everywhere...
Well, thank you for your time, sir
I appreciate the interview...



[Intro]
So, here we go, here we go
Am I ready? Are you ready?
Are they ready? Are we ready?
I don’t know, I don’t know
What do I know?
I know you need to
Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind

Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind, open your mind

[Chorus]
I’m like hallelujah!
Praise God, almighty, the most high
Alpha and omega in the sky
I’m like hallelujah!
Praise God, almighty, the most high
Alpha and omega in the sky, I'm like

[Verse 1]
Made in the image of God
With a blunt in my mouth and a bitch on the side
Hold up, wait a minute my life need a massage
Happy ending with a money menage
Me, dirt broke, that’s a money mirage
Runnin' my city like I’m the Wizard of Oz
Everybody wanna know what I devise
Everybody wanna know, yeah
Got a new vision, everybody listen
Fuck around I got a new religion
What it is, what it isn’t, all of that revision
Get the fuck up out that prison
It’s obvious the body is the cracker
The worse it is, what hurts it is, the blacker
Everybody actin' like the brain don’t matter
Mind over matter unless we talkin' brain matter
Actin like you never seen a ass way fatter
Bitch way badder, mind in the gutter
Food for thought, yeah that’s the plan with the butter
Talkin' shit, ya get hit like what up?
I just wanna do it but I can’t
World wanna tell me what I ain’t
Far from a saint, come now just let that boy paint
Let a mothafucka like this live
Yeah, lemme show 'em what I gotta give
Let a mothafucka like this live, like, like
Made in the image of God, can you feel the vibe?
Mothafucka is you ready to ride? Is you ready to die?
Like B.I.G. the V.I.P
The greatest of all time, I’ll be Ali
See, I be
The cost of livin', it ain’t free
See, the tab on me
Feelin’ like the man got tabs on me
Wonder if I only had rags on me
Would ya love me, want me?
Here with this, I know
Funny thing is I don’t even know
All I get to have and all I have to give
Is what my God will give
Yeah, lemme show 'em what I gotta give
Let a mothafucka like this live, like, like

[Chorus]
I’m like hallelujah!
Praise God, almighty, the most high
Alpha and omega in the sky
I’m like hallelujah!
Praise God, almighty, the most high
Alpha and omega in the sky

[Bridge]
I’m like
Hold up, wait a minute
Know my mind been goin' like whoa, ayy
I been thinkin', prayin', hopin', dreamin' it won’t go away
I know my mind alright, I know, ayy
I know my mind alright, do you know a way?
Your way, do it your way
Do it your way, do it
(Open your)

[Outro]
This is beyond the flesh, this is beyond the flesh
This is from the soul and for the soul
This is for all my brothers and sisters, for all my children
This is for every race
This is for every color, every creed
Music does not discriminate, music is made to assimilate
Black is beautiful, black is beautiful, and so are you
Strollin' down the highway, I’m strollin'
And I was strollin' down the highway
Strollin', strollin', strollin', strollin'
I was strollin' down the highway
With my mind ablaze
Strollin' down the highway
For days and days
Strollin' down the highway
With my mind ablaze
Strollin' down the highway
For days and days and days and days

[Skit]
Hello?
I know, I know, I’m supposed to been home, I’m coming
Just, I’m on my way home, every time
I’m on my way there right now, okay?
Oh shit!
Life, what’s it all about?
What? Wait, where am I?
The space between spaces
Beyond time and existential intelligence
Forget, fuck all the hippy shit, where am I?
What’s the last thing you remember, Atom?
I was in the store, I bought some smokes
I came outside, the phone rang, I...
How do you know my name?!
You were walking home from work when you died
Died? Dead? I’m dead? I’m dead?!
It wasn’t an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time
What do you mean it’s my time? What? I got...
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?
Your wife and son? You see, that’s what I like to hear
You find out you’re dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man, answer me, what about my family?
What’s going on with Vanessa?
They’re doing just fine
You see, your wife was cheating on you
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon' tell me I’m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!
Atom, none of that matters now
Walk with me
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well, I don’t see no pitchforks
Little red people runnin' around
It ain’t too hot up in here so I guess this ain’t hell either
I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void
Is to look upon it as a waiting room
So...are you God?
Yes, I’m God

[Intro]
Aye, let me just rap...

[Verse 1]
I've upgraded while they've waited
Will they love it, will they hate it
Never faded I evade it
Cause I never really want to complicate it
Think I've made it, yes I did
I'm giving them bars like a bid
Let me rewind it like a vid
"Did he just say that?" Yes, I did
And they really wanna get it like I live
God damn mother fucker what I gotta give
Way back in DC, at Liv
On the way to that everlasting life
Will they rob you? Yeah, they might
Hold up, wait a minute, veer to the right
On this road to success, I've faced my fears
Then hop on that flight

[Hook]
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded

[Verse 2]
My bitch bad got a sick figure
Play 1 show and get 6 figures
We build bigger, money tall as a mountain, bitch
I've got Hilfigers, like goddamn
Yes sir, I know who I am
I'm that main man Martin, out here kicking out Pam
Just riding 'round with my Gina in that all-black Beamer
All the way from Maryland whipping out West Covina
Hold up, now check my demeanor
Yeah, your girl bad, my girl meaner
I've upgraded

[Bridge]
I've got the Akira on the wall
I just can't follow their law
Swear to God that they know me
They don't know me at all
And its all right, it's alright
I've upgraded

[Verse 3]
Let me bring in them new kicks like Timbaland
I gotta reboot with this upgrade
My metaphors on Cloud 9
And the meaning behind them is so vague
Before I created this universe
I had to fly through the Bermuda first
6ix on the beat, then we queue the verse
Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge
Feel like I'm in a Fifth Element
I'm in my element lost in paradise
Its me, you and Leeloo, Korben Dallas in Fhloston Paradise
Never by chance like a pair of dice
I don't give a fuck about their advice
I'm on another planet, no I'm not manic
Bitch I'm decompressed, know they can't stand it
Cause I pilot it and manned it the best
All they demanded was I gave up and laid dream to rest
(God damn!) Hold up, wait a minute; fuck all that shit
I left Earth ages ago to avoid and duck all that shit
You know when we on
Making music that's gon' survive for eons
Bloodshed from America to Sierra Leone
That's that shit I can't be on, that's the reason I be gone
Yes, I keep it professional like Luc Besson and Leon

[Hook]
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded



[Hook]
You already know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet
Like fuck it where the weed at?
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass
You know I need that

[Verse 1]
Now these bitches say they love me, but they're just obsessed with the image
Now if practice makes perfect then this is a scrimmage
Cause I ain't perfect, I never said I was
But now they're hating cause a brother finally got some buzz
The things that I say (Say)
The places I'm seeing (Seeing)
The people I talk to you don't know what I mean
Even matters of love, it ain't always as it seems
Yeah there's plenty in the sea until you hit the mainstream
The girl that I love, the one I call my honey
Now I wonder if she love me for me or my fucking money
Sometimes I think about the love that I had in the past
I truly miss it but it just wasn't destined to last
Cause our separation lit a fire under my ass
And now I'm gunning for the throne yeah that is my task
Just a youngin' with a dream, that acquired a team
Motivated by bad bitches and rockin' supreme
Now the whole world wonders what's his next move
That all depends on what I feel that I need to improve
Tell me what you think of me I swear it doesn't matter
Just as long as I am happy and my pocket's getting fatter
Just watch me shatter the competition
Getting madder then all of them wishing
You couldn't done it like I done it bitch I run it, Ah!
Yeah you know I do it like it ain't never been done
Hit the Vegas strip and blow a million euro just for fun
To be honest I may have embellished that last line
Chillin' with a shorty that is so much more than fine
At the penthouse poppin' bottles of that hundred thousand dollar wine
I got the connect, met 'em through the grape vine

[Hook 2]
You know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet
Like fuck it where the weed at?
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass
You know I need that
You-you-you know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Now these bitches say they love me
But they just obsessed with the image
You know what I been on
You know where I be at

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's been a year and everything I said would happen, has
New school style with old school bars like Alcatraz
Cause I ain't never second guess this music shit
I knew this shit was all I ever wanted, all I ever had
Born famous now it's just time to convince the world
Ditch cats, like drainage if they disrespect it don't step through
I paint pictures for your mind and bring it to life like cinematography
Say it then I do it my whole career's a prophecy now
Better grab your jacket, cause in this world we live in it's cold out
And when my album hit the stores it's sold out
Like these rapper's careers
I'm the sum of our fears
Fuck a Grammy nominated bitch, I made it and I'm here
I said it's all about the fans, not all about the record sells
They said it wouldn't work, I told them go fuck themselves
Why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail
Why-why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail

[Hook 2]
You know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet
Like fuck it where the weed at?
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass
You know I need that
You-you-you know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Now these bitches say they love me
But they just obsessed with the image
You know what I been on
You know where I be at

[Outro]
"You gotta realize, a lot of the time when I talk
And I'm talking extremely cocky, I'm not talking
About myself, I'm talking about the work."
You know here I be at (be at)



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Cannon

[Verse 1]
It’s funny how your role model gets outdated, becomes the old model
At the hotel, asking for mo' bottles
Ménage et plus one - I’m fucking fo' models
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle
Murci-lago, whipping through Chicago
All these beautiful women follow wherever I go
Million-dollar deals on the table
Just a couple years ago I couldn’t pay for cable
Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label
Plus Def Jam, know who I am
I’m that motherfucker that do it just ’cause I can
Now I’m on a level that your elevator can’t reach
I’ve got information that the school system doesn’t teach
I've got verses that your Sunday service wouldn’t dare to preach
Second-coming-of-Christ flow, they like, "Whoa!"
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul
And changed your mind like I’m penetrating your skull
I seen shit John Lennon couldn’t imagine
Just me and a mic on a main stage, spazzing
It’s the type of shit normal people can’t even fathom
So much swag, kiss your bitch and she orgasms
I’m hazardous, you would have sworn I was from Nazareth
I’m resurrecting hip-hop like it was Lazarus

[Verse 2]
Step to the mic and they gon' dread it like Weezy
Man, this industry is so damn greasy
Swaggin' on the track, they say I sound like Yeezy
But I don't give a fuck cause gettin' money too easy
21st century, doing something mean to it
Play this in the south and everybody gonna lean to it
"Greatest of all time" has got a nice ring to it
We do it for the music, money ain't a thing to us
Been shining muhfucka what's bling to us
Most loved, most hated at the same time
Star player in this bitch and it's game time
Who you know lyrically killed the club in the same rhyme?
They call me Logic, motherfucker, better know the name
I spit crack like Pusha (Yuugh!), Novocaine
We never dumb it down, you know we just numb it down
And watch you get up in your feelings when we come around
Grew up on section 8, you probably can't relate
‘Cause y’all just watched the throne, I’m tryna checkmate
I been shinin since before I brought them diamonds in, and
They talk that shit, they talk that shit, it’s so astonishing
Y’all better swallow that pride like a klonopin
Cause I can lay tracks with my eyes closed, Chinaman

[Verse 3]
Got a show in LA Sunday, then New York Monday
Looking at the BET cypher like I’ll be there one day
It’s the Roc reincarnated, we call it Visionary
Fuck the world ’til I’m on top, we call that missionary
The game’s on pause, it need to load again
These rappers is reruns and we need a new episode again
Yeah, well motherfucker, this the pilot
So fly I recorded this on the PJ next to the pilot on a CB
Now you see me on the TV
Said this would happen back in the day but you ain’t believe me
So um, I'mma keep rising to the top
Never stop and finger fuck the world ’til the day my album drop



[Verse]
Yeah, smoking in London while the snow fall
In another country so pardon me for the roll call
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense
On the first fucking train to Paris so pardon my french
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, "bitch please, what up?"
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me (Biggie)
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel
My ex hit me talkin bout she wanna make up
But on the real, I got no time for cover girls
Music is my main bitch, no time for other girls
I'm finna blow like Hiroshima, my demeanor get meaner
Watch me elevate to arenas
Me without the mic, that's like
Martin without the Gina, Venus without Serena
Now these thirsty bitches on the dick, we call that Aquafina
I used to bus tables until them tables turned
And everything I have obtained is everything I've earned
And everything I rap about is everything I've learned
So hopefully the listener can position a situation where they don't get burned
And they can learn from my mistakes, like I've learned from the greats
To do whatever it takes, for Heaven's sakes open your mind
This shit's one of a kind, elegant and refined, irrelevant to the swine
What's the deal?
Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville, on the real
To various people I do appeal, because of skill
So this the type of shit I'm gon keep making
That make MCs break fast like flapjacks and bacon
Rest in peace to BIG, and many other fallen soldiers
Never Hollywood, I'm grounded like a cup of Folgers, bitch I told ya
Allow me to open up your mind and mold ya
Indulge ya, within this shit I call the second Renaissance
The system broke and they sent Logic in for maintenance
Cause all you wack rappers couldn't break change to make sense
I'm back again with another argument about how much I'm black again
Fighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin
It's kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you
That's ignant
Ain't seen my momma in a minute
Cause growing up she called me a nigga
That would never amount to nothing
Racism from my own momma, left home cause of drama
But I can make it in the rap game, look at Obama
You ain't been in my shoes, you don't know my story
You don't know what's in store, but bitch I stocked the inventory
Fuck a critic with the balls to try to tell me how I feel
You wasn't with me as a child
Never once did you feel the pain of my stomach
That manifested from the lack of meals
Headed to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels
We aim to keep it real
And hell no we ain't never missing
Came a long way from eating when government gave permission
If you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen
Just an outkast with a mission to spit to whoever listen
Bitch it's Logic!



[Intro]
Logic

[Verse]
I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah but can’t convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
I need redemption no need to mention my past
Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
The glitz, the glamor, the lights, the camera, the action
The stage, the fans, the speakers blasting
You know I want it, I need it
Don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it
This is everything I dreamed of
It’s everything I’ve ever wanted
But is it really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blueprints?
Did he have it right there in his hands?
Anybody give me a hint
I can feel it now I know it’s coming
And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say
I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission
Incarceration through these bars created a prison
And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given
25 to life yeah that’s how I’m living
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it
But there’s only way I'mma know
I’m like a seed planted in the dirt
Feels like I’ve been waiting forever to grow
And maybe today is the day
And maybe tonight is the night
But one thing that I know for sure
This time I’ma get it right

[Outro]
*Crowds cheering*
Logic, Logic, Logic, Logic



[Chorus]
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been fiending for this moment
I've been dreaming 'bout this moment
I guess this is how it feel to have everything you ever wanted
Writing these records like a dissertation
While the fans goin' crazy from anticipation
Damn, nine years that's a lot of patience
And now I'm looking at my idols and feeling adjacent
It's hell of a long way from back in the basement
Looking at hip-hop tryna find my placement
I bought my first pair of Jordans at 22
Same year I bought a crib too
Now my face in magazines I used to flip through
And my music on all the sites I used to sift through
Remember meeting Nas for the first time
Shook his hand and he started quoting my lines
Said he a fan, goddamn this is my time
I'ma get it, I'ma do it till we prime time
I told him every single day that I be at it
In the studio recording like an addict
He said that real hip-hop shit I had it
Thinking to myself, "Damn, man, you made Illmatic"

[Chorus]
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life
I used to wonder what it feel like

[Verse 2]
Aight, I guess we back again
With another verse about how much I'm black again
You don't like it blame God for the packaging
Bringing up my race, don't call me a white rapper then
Damn, they judging me by my skin tone
Instead of my talent, man these motherfuckers been wrong
But it's all good I just thought I'd address it
And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it
This is dedicated to anyone with a dream
And a realization of what following it means
Breaking the cycle and not following your genes
That perfect moment when your logic intervenes
And let you know that everything ain't always what it seems
But if you really looking, I promise you'll find your dreams
This is everything I ever wanted, half of y'all won't get it
The other half will probably laugh and wonder how I did it
I just spit it from my mind, one word at the time
Take everything I'm going through and put it in a rhyme
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of weight upon my shoulders
But this is my therapy as I flow this
Spilling out my heart, I just hope somebody notice
I've been real from the start and you motherfuckers know this
Once my name elevated that's when the fame escalated
But on the real, I've grown accustomed to the stares
People watching every move I make like it was theirs
All up in my business, and even in my personal affairs
Now, I know I talk a lot of game, but I ain't trynna sell you
Cause honestly, I could show you better than I could tell you
And even though there's been moments when everything have fell through
We kept it moving, assuming even the greatest fail too
I swear this business shit is do or die
I never contemplated suicide, I'm too alive
In front of thousands, but I'm talking like it's you and I
And everyday fewer find their dreams because fewer try

[Chorus]
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life

[Scratches (Sampled): Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Everything I seen, made me everything I am
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
Throw your hands in the air, stand behind mine
Everything I seen, made me everything I am
Stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine

[Outro: Jon Bellion]
Said, welcome to forever
Welcome to forever
Welcome to... forever...

[Intro: Steve Wyreman]
Aight, well—higher probably, right?
Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?

[Verse: Logic]
I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then?
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then?
But, I'm not defined by the sales of my first week
'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak
As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races, gathering from different places
I just contemplate, shoutout to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates
It’s like, I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of grey
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of grey
Feeling like my dream is a world away
What it feel like?
I used to wonder what it feel like
Yeah, used to wonder what it

[Chorus: Logic]
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like

[Post-Chorus: Logic]
You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything

[Outro: Thalia]
Hello... welcome to the 'Under Pressure' program—
My name is Thalia. I will be here to assist you with the information about the album and its creation...

[Produced by 6ix]



[Intro]
People want to talk about what makes them happy
What really makes you happy?
Tell me what makes you happy
Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad
Tell me what makes you happy
People say its money, give me the money
All the money (money)

[Verse 1]
If I could live forever and a day
Know I'd never fade away
But my life is not okay, I...
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...
I wish had a lot of money
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper, you already know
My life would be so much better with cheddar
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta
Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Wouldn't be nothing, working that minimum wage
And cooking McMuffins, so I'm puffing on this green
Wishing I had more money than I do
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, ah!
And so I'm all about my business
Is there anyone who wit this?
Can a brother get a witness like: Ah—Ooh, Ah—Ooh
Wassup with it, come and get it
Tell me now what's on your mind
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety
They say that money cannot make you happy
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?
Why you trying me, like ah...

[Interlude]
Now I'mma tell 'em what makes me happy
This what makes me happy, right here
Like this...

[Verse 2]
Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy

[Hook]
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper, deeper than money
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
You know its deeper, deeper honey
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than your money
My money, they money, everybody money
Said, this shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
It's deeper than money

[Break]
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
Think I need to focus more on my health

[Verse 3]
I do, I do—this the shit that I love
This the shit that I love
Comes straight from above
Off the top off the dome
Gotta get it, go home
Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate
What the fuck is on my mind?
I just, I just want to rhyme
This the type of shit I got to do
Oh my God, what's the time?
Can you feel it right now?
Can you feel the whole style?
It's the type of shit, I gotta get it, gotta get it
I've been vibing out here in Malibu
Would you come through?
Tell me motherfucker truly what it do?
L-O-G-I-C, this is who I be
L.A. where I'm at, M.D. what I be
All that, all that
God, I can feel it, I can feel it
I'm a fly on the wall feeling ten feet tall
Right now this the type of shit, this the style
This the motherfucking style
And so I tell em...

[Hook]
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper, deeper than money
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
You know its deeper, deeper honey
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than your money
My money, they money, everybody money
Said, this shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
It's deeper than money



[Verse 1: Logic]
Uh, feeling like I gotta get it right now
Moving like a killer in the darkness outta sight now
On another level, so the devil wanna fight now
Growing up dirt broke, but it's looking bright now
Bitches on the pipe now, want the dick right now
But I can't fade, taking shots with the sight down
Uh, uh, yeah, I coulda died that day
But I guess God don't ride that way
Chillin' in the cut, getting high all day
With a couple bad bitches, I'ma do it my way
Driven by the way that I be livin', everything I got 'em giving
Why you think they can't do it like me? Uh

[Chorus: Logic & Jhené Aiko]
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Break it down, roll it up)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Logic]
No, I don't smoke, but I'm feeling like

Bitches on my dick, but I don't give a damn (Yeah)
Blowin' up my phone, trynna get the dinner plan
Back stage with the homies 'bout to get it, man
Fuck a fifteen minute man
Look young, but I been a man
All that ringtone rap, make a brother wanna kill a man
I am just a sinner, man, keep it real, yeah, that been the plan
You know we always do it for the fans
I be super low key like No I.D. (Uh)
Always in the lab, yes sir, that's me (Yeah)
Label that I'm reppin', that's VMG
From the womb to the tomb, we be keepin' it G (Logic)
What you know about me?
Everybody know that I be reppin' that 3—
0—1, fuck around and get signed
West Deer Park, that's where I'm from

[Chorus: Logic & Jhené Aiko]
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Break it down, roll it up)
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Break it down, roll it up)
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling like I gotta bring it back again
Always on another level, don't know how to act again
I be on that real (real), no I never back down
You don't wanna fuck around, busting like a MAC now
Started from the bottom, ain't no way I'ma go back down
Slack now, harder motherfucker, hell naw, never that now
Tell me that they love me, I don't give a fuck
Boy chillin' in the cut, bad bitch, far from a slut

[Chorus: Logic & Jhené Aiko]
I'ma get high

[Intro: Monsters of Folk (Sampled)]
Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe in

[Verse: Logic]
Dear God, I think it's time we had a conversation
These lonely nights is getting to me so my mind is racing
I think about this life I live and all the shit I'm facing
More secrets in my mind than a freemason
I get lonely at times, and then I write these rhymes
I'm only human, I want to hit the club and fuck a dime
But I know that's not the answer to my problems
Lord help me solve them, disintegrate and dissolve them
Laying in bed with a girl I'm pretty sure is my next
Contemplating the sex... while I think about my ex
Am I wrong, yeah
Dear God, am I wrong, uh
Dear God, tell me, am I wrong?
For living the life of a king surrounded by these pawns
Fans telling me I'm the greatest but I never hear them
Cause I ain't hit the pinnacle yeah I'm still persevering
Demons whispering in my ear but no I never fear them
People thinking they on his level they ain't even near him
I just want to spread positivity
Through lyrical ability
They call it selling out but I just call it versatility
Yeah, its my life
My wrongs, and My rights
My battle, My songs, and My fights
Now everybody want to come around
Tell me where was you last year when a brother was down
Not a single one of you mother fuckers believed in the brand
Extended a hand
And now you want to be my man
I think not
You quick to shape shift like ink blots
The real Dilla we cut classic no fitters
What about the time I was nine
And my mama almost murdered me?
Don't think I forgot that shit, it still burdens me
Her bare hands tight around my throat
"I can't breathe" I screamed, "I can't breathe mama
Don't you want me mama? Don't you love me mama?" What the fuck
Where was you then God? Tell me now
How's a brother supposed to stay sane? Tell me how
Why you let me live but let another die
Why you dry my tears but let another cry
Gotta know
Set to detonate I gotta blow
That shit for show
I used to wonder why in the hell you would make me suffer
But now in the end I understand that it made me tougher

[Outro: Logic]
I get up when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough, I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, yeah
I get up, yeah, yeah
I get up when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough, I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, yeah
I get up, I get up
Get up



[Intro]
Bobby Soxer
Do the D.A.N.C.E
1,2,3,4 fight
Stick to the B.E.A.T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a PYT
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A.B.C
(You have interfered with our affairs for the last time)
That's how you make it right
Sinatra

[Verse 1: Logic]
I am literally in the air, right now, rapping up a stewardess
First class, I am so new at this
Used to ride the metro, now that shit is retro
Like the infrareds on my feet, baby let's go
Sinatra what they know me by, Logic what they call me
Gotta catch a flight but the fans wanna stall me
Life of a don, chain just glowin', always in the lab with the fresh kicks on
I'm at the MGM, rocking MCM, Bobby Soxer on my arm it's only 10 PM
Got the Rattpack with me going HAM at the hotel
Name brand everything fuck a wholesale
No, I am not materialistic
I was broke my whole life, and no I don't miss it
Last 7 years of my life was in a lab
Working everyday giving it everything I had
Now that a brother is finally recognized
I will not let the limelight hypnotize
Everybody be sure, I'mma always want more
Does anybody make real shit anymore?

[Interlude: Justice]
Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

[Verse 2: Logic]
The grind never stops, like I'm running from the cops
It's hard to stay humble when you're force-fed props
But I don't give a damn, I am just a man
I am not more important than any one of my fans
First name Bobby so I'm all about The Hundreds
Work so hard errybody think I'm blunted (hah)
Gunning hard with the mask and Glock
And I'mma stay with extra clips 'till the casket drops
Finna blow in the next three years, tops
Talking worldwide, not just hip-hop
Rappers now-a-days so flip-flop
Talking 'bout you, wanna work
Motherfucker kick rocks
I am on the come up, headed to the top
Repping MD, and never will I stop
Me and the crew V's up, Visionary what it do
Step to the mic, lyricism ensues
We go hard, only on campus when I wanna study abroad
Guess that's why they wonder if I go there
All the groupie bitches wanna put they fingers through my hair
Can't fade the thirst, chill out, whoa there
Let me get it, let me bring it back
Haters talking shit but I get richer when they doing that
Yes I am pursuing that, number one album, worldwide
And fuck whoever doubt him - Logic

[Outro: Justice]
Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance



[Intro: KRS-ONE]
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!

[Hook]
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"

[Verse 1]
Sellin' records on a major label
But I'm still movin' like I'm independent
Still respected like I'm in the pen and
I'm just talkin' my shit so don't get offended
Bitch I been invented this real
Been the same since my deal
If you try to say that I'm changin'
Wait for the album, see how you feel
My third album my Graduation, like Kanye
Music on another level
Yeah, I'm tryna take this shit further beyond 'Ye
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise
Like I'm Beyoncé
Got a couple million in the bank right now
But I want my zeros beyond Jay
Counting money like Rothenberg PC
Paid a price to be me, ain't it nice to be me?
Ain't it nice to be free?
Do what you want when you wanna do it
On the real, it ain't nothin' to it
Young man on his Alan Watts
In a bookstore with my pocket watch
Wifey, goin' hard with the squats
Life good so they take shots
That's childish, I hate shots
I've been at it, Rattpack, get that shit tatted
Fuck with me on Snapchat
Talk shit and get clapped back
Only carry-on is my backpack
When I jetset like a war vet, what up?

[Hook]
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"

[Verse 2]
Everybody know I've been at it with this rap shit
Fuck around with this trap shit
But this next album is a wrap, shit
My third album my Graduation, like Kanye
Music on another level
Yeah, I'm tryna take this shit further beyond 'Ye
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise
Like I'm Beyoncé
Got a couple million in the bank right now
But I want my zeros beyond Jay
I want my zeros beyond, I want my zeros beyond Jay
That shit they talkin' beyond fake
Fact I’m here right now beyond fate, uh
I'ma take a minute and get in it so you know I'm in it
This right here my house, you the tenant
Everything that happens, I intend it
Every word that you hear, I invented
I've been living like a king, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just been bumpin' that Destroyer "Girl in a Sling"
That's the type of shit I bring
I'm doin' this for the fans
So they can turn up in my absence
Started a channel
Already made a hundred grand off of AdSense
I ain't do it for the money though
I don't do it for the money though
Shout out to Kid Cudi though
That's the homie, you already know

[Hook]
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change
Still me and my homies and we all the same
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"

[Outro]
I don't give a damn, I know who I am, tell 'em
I don't give a damn, I know who I am
Yeah they talkin', but I'm gettin' money for me and my fam
This shit ain't that super deep, nah, this right here just the jam
This right here the jam
This right here just the jam
This shit right here jam, this my jam
This shit here the jam
5-0 triple-0



[Verse 1]
I want what I want how I want when I want it
I’ma keep it a hunnid, I’m blunted
I don’t give a damn, I don’t give a fuck about another man
Fuck a brother man
I’ma make it, make it rain like the weather man
Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man
Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman
In the hood I’m a better man
Wish a mothafucka would, would
Whole life I been up to no good
Change it all if I could
Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can’t
I’m a sinner, not a saint
Layers to my life, no I can’t
Cover it up with paint
Keep on livin', livin'
Livin' on money and women
As soon as I’m in 'em, I’m out
Now the truth never come out my mouth
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like

[Refrain]
I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

[Verse 2]
I’d rather be a different man in another world
Than work for the man in my universe
Wonder what it feel like to take flight
Momma told me everything gon' be alright
I mean my life can’t be off right
But come to think about it
Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white
Can you mothafuckas see alright?
I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it
Every day tragic
If you’re from where I’m from, everyday ain’t magic
On this I know
I been telling everybody I’ma give it a go, I know
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I did it, I lived it
While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa!
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey
Really wonder what the remedy
Tell me, how the world gon' remember me?
Got me feelin like the enemy
Like I ain’t got no energy
I been lookin' for an entity
Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity
Fuck all that

[Refrain]
I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

[Bridge]
I know my life was lived the wrong way
I know I did you wrong in my own way
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
That hypnotized the only
Part of me you loved
Part of me that had the strength to rise above
Part of me you know
Part of me you love more than to let it go

[Outro: Killer Mike]
Dear God, I just wanna know why
Why do you put us here?
Why do you put us below?
Why do you put us subservient?
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out
We betray each other
We lie, we take from one another
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end
But the state don't forgive us
I'm locked up and half my friends
And then when I get out, or I make it out
I'm expected to somehow give back
To people who never wanted to see me escape
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror
And it's gettin' clearer
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom
So, if you real, if you're out there for real
Please explain to me why
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?
And why do the people
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right
But tonight, I am in this church
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
And all I wanna do is believe in you
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt
And they make sure it hurts
And I am tired of hurtin', man
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared
So if you out there, do something about this
'Cause I can't take it no more
Help me



[Intro]
Real talk, just RattPack, besides that, nobody I trust

[Verse 1: Logic]
Back again like I never left
Young Sinatra, that’s to the death
We turnt up ’til we go deaf
Rep RattPack ’til my last breath
I cut records like Kid Cudi
Day and night, that’s all the time
From the underground to the mainstream
My same team get all the shine
They wanted beef but I never knew
I just keep the peace and get revenue
Stay true, they never do
Cut all ties, I’ll sever you
These rappers like women, that's off of their pill
We keeping it real but they flow is irregular
Grab the mic and I murder on the regular
While these bitches hit me up on my cellular
I can’t take the time that I take to rhyme
And just bullshit, man, that blow my mind
I’m 23 like MJ
That’s no rest like overtime
Writing rhymes on the tour bus
We stay real to the core of us
They talk shit ’bout RattPack
But every day, man, there’s more of us
That money come and that money go
But this music shit, man, that’s all I know
I been broke and I got paid
Like a Goodfella that got made
I’m draped up and I’m dripped out
Went to school, got kicked out
Told my mama, she flipped out
Said “fuck it all” and I dipped out
But I’m back though, whole time
Fuck bitches, I just rhyme
Brand new state of mind
My lifestyle is so divine
Cause I’ve lived and I’ve learned
Now I hustle and earn
Cause once you in the limelight, everybody concerned
With your wellbeing, and if you feel okay
Bitch, you wasn’t here a year ago
Why are you here today?
I’ve got professor paper, your money need an extension
I’m selling success, save up and pay attention
Money can’t buy happiness, but that shit can support it
Cause what’s a family of five if you can’t even afford it?

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Feeling good, feeling great
Feeling like a XXL Freshman on your bitch ass, nigga
Creeping on the come-up with my nigga Logic
Time to get it popping
Got your city watching, hit the stage, them titties popping
What it do? Bruh, I fuck with you
Don’t let these haters knock ya
Keep it gangsta, keep it, keep it G
Don’t keep them lames around
And fuck the world, fuck the, fuck the world
Y’all gon’ feel my passion (pass the blunt)
I’mma create that shit that’s fuckin’ everlasting
And I’m overboard with the tactics
Walk out the house and I ain’t even matching
But I’m stunting cause I’m the coolest and the youngest
I told ‘em I was a threat, they scared of what’s next
I’m Christoper Dorner in effect if you speakin’ down on my name
Walking down this road, I’m the only one in my lane
And my fingers getting itchy, that’s that money coming to get me
Mr. Wright, Mr. Dizzy Wright, Vegas nigga shit (making noise)
Wait a minute, ain’t them niggas on the list?
Making moves, making super moves, who the fuck is you?
Nigga what? Nigga, nigga, what? Them niggas the truth
It’s an honor to be a part of the heart of the young Sinatra
You ain’t gotta smoke weed, we gon’ celebrate with this vodka
Grinding for some time, and I’m hella straight with the dollars
So if you call me and you need me, then I’ve got ya
Don’t talk about being the realest, niggas gon’ feel us regardless
We gotta keep on killing, I got the mind of Martian
I’m spaced out somewhere in s world that I never been
Living out my dreams and I’m still tryna settle in
See it’s amazing, studio sessions, beautiful blessings
I’m faded, usually quiet, but I’ve got this message
So I speak it like I know it
Got my shot, I took it and I didn’t fuckin’ blow it
Now everything is in motion
Calling out my homies who understand what it means
To get off your ass, get on your grind and follow your dreams
Making it a fact to be great at what you achieve
If I lead, would you follow with a ease?

[Verse 3: Logic]
Open your mind, elevate to the level of this rhyme
Keep it G to the dime, many seek, never find
Never knowing when I’m flowing, feeling heroic, never ask
Chilling with your bitch, I can’t help but grab up on that ass
Swerving at 120 while she’s rolling weed on the dash
Many never follow their dreams but follow the cash
And this is the reason the Reaper is coming for they ass
Top dollar, money, bitches, Impalas
Fuck it all, let me holler
And show you how we do it where I come from
We getting money for the long term, not just no lump sum
How you feeling?
Make a killing, bitches higher than the ceiling
I’m Goku, you fuckers is Krillin with the spirit bomb
Fuck around, throw your body on the lawn
Right in front of your mom, motherfuckers, I’m gone
RattPack



[Intro: Adele]
Without me knowing, they melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Logic]
Let me get it right now
Make you get aroused
Baby you been on my mind for a while now
I just wanna take some time
Write this rhyme
With a beautiful woman like you in mind
Baby be mine
Im trying to find what makes you tick, can we talk
Maybe walk around the park
Trust me girl I'll stand apart
All women ain't bitches and all
Men aren't dawgs even though we bark
Cause I just want to get to know you
Maybe run around and show you
What a gentlemen is
Yeah, tell me what it do
Shawty I'm coming for you
Ain't talking about sex
I'm talking about something from above
I'm talking about love
Talking bout love, love, love (love)
Now that you know that I'm for real
It's the perfect time to kill
Any fear that you may have
Baby girl I won't be mad if you ain't feeling it
But if you down better believe I'm killing it
Take you to the crib on that late night drilling it

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2: Logic]
Wait a second, hold up
How the hell you think I got this name
Girl, I'm all about the brain
Why you think they call me (Logic)
Ok, condom in my pocket
Lay on the bed let me rock it
Please don't stop the spit from profit
But this right here on the house
Fuck the bed, we cutting on the floor then later on the couch
Ladies give out 'till I gets it in
Make you scream and make you grin
From the very beginning from the second I'm in
I'm trying to tease you let me please you
Baby girl you know I need you
Do you like you never had it (done)
Putting work with this one right here
Yeah you know it's just for fun
Give it to you like I was trying to conceive a son
I gets it done then I'm ready for more
So, ain't no telling where we'll go
But one thing that I know fo sho
This angel has no halo
I don't play no games
You can ask my ex I never eat the box
But if I control her I may select some freaky shit to start
Then bring it back
We can go for hours girl I never slept
Tell me how you want it
Face to face or rough and from the back
Just like that she gon' overwork me if I let her
But I don't give a damn I just wanna feel better (Aye)

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh



[Collision: Logic]
Music. Shows. Relationships. Fame. Happiness. Music. Fortune. Staying humble. Music. Fans. Grinding. Shows. Music. Touring. Money. Fate. Music. God. Fear. Bills. Friends. Enemies. Family. Music

[Verse 1: Logic]
Step into the mind of a young man
And if you don't then I don't really give a damn
All I wanna do is make you understand
But if you don't wanna listen I guess you ain't a part of the plan
Sorry if I digress
All I ever wanted was to be the best
Through lyricism to put your mind to the test
Stayin' up, late night, no rest
Feelin' bulletproof, no vest, but I confess
My mind's a mess, living in a world of stress I digest
But I gotta keep grinding
'Cause everyday success what I'm finding
And I don't give a damn if you hate on me
'Cause when I blow what you gon' say homie?
Heh, not a goddamn thing
But that's enough of that, I'ma let my home girl sing

[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Logic]
All I think about is music
Don't get me wrong I think
About other things but this how I fuse it
So the whole wide world can use it
When you feel like you just might lose it
Take a breath, homie, don't confuse it
Take a step in the mind of Logic
As long as you don't abuse it
So let me break it down for the whole world
Like I broke it down for my old girl
I can't deal with your bullshit
No more, gotta let it go, let it unfurl
'Cause I remember the time
When I was living sublime, wanted to make a living off of my rhymes
But the whole world told me never mind
I'm a star, how could I not shine?

[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Logic]
I just wanna take it to another level
That I've never even been on so I can sit on
Every single piece of paper that I put a pen on
And when I been on for like ten years
I'ma do it better than anybody before me
So the whole wide world will adore me and no need to assure me
And if you wonder why I'm rapping so fast
It's 'cause I gotta lot of things on my mind
That wanna come out at the same time
In other words I'm racing
I used to pursue my dreams, but now they're reality
And that's what I'm chasing
Why are we on this earth?
Why must we feel pain?
Why does everybody feel the need
To judge one another when we're all the same?

[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)



[Intro]
Dead Presidents III, not to be confused with Growing Pains III
Logic this logic that, Logic sick, Logic wack
Logic just don't give a fuck, RATTPACK

[Verse 1: Logic]
So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease
Got it capiche? This is my house you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle
Paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowing what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hollow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you
So I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow
You whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky
I'mma dominate the world like my name is Brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page
To numb the pain like novacaine, mothafucker

[Hook]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2: Logic]
Allow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic
Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Rip the mic to set the example
While all these mu-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force feed enemies truth serum
We want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
In your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it
I get from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat you a pussy
Knuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, In they mind
Cuz I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to dame's I catch plane's
They catch feelins
Haters keep my name in they mouth like fillings
High as the ceiling
Ya'll really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
Thankful for every breath I'm givin
Fuck social division
On the road to success and their ain't no time for collision
People ask "how you get your flow so amazing"
To which I reply "I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions"
Haters takin' shots they never graze him
Now if pro is the opposite of con
What's the opposite of pro-gress
I love my country but that shit a mess
Grew up on section 8, I can attest
And now they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best

[Hook]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 3: Logic]
Now if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it
Now run it back and retrieve it
Till you receive it in your mother f*ckin mind
Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99
Back in 1999 that's when I began to rhyme
Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine
Daddy was smokin crack I was raised by a single mom
Fastin every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan
I was poor as fuck me and my momma, we didn't have a dime
At 16 the school system dismissed him and wished him well
But my momma never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?
So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
I left home at 17
Shortly after my momma got stabbed by fucking around in the streets
But she still breathin which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
So many rappers biting me you would think they was teethin
And now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story



[Chorus]
I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these mafuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these mafuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd

[Verse 1]
Come on, baby girl, tell me what you want, I got what you need
Said she independent, so don’t get offended if she leave
I said I won’t get offended, I’ll just get some Fendi
And repress my emotions in material shit that can be a distraction
Pussy and money, sometimes I feel the satisfaction
Till I spend that bread and bust that nut and now I’m back, son
After the damage is done
Rearrange the game and let 'em know your name

[Chorus]
Right now
All these mafuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these mafuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
"Sinatra"

[Verse 2]
You know the drill, come on, you know the deal
If my shorty acting up, I wife swap like Uncle Phil
Moving at the speed of sound, let’s slow it down and keep it trill
Yeah, we keep it real, kill 'em with kindness and not the steel
Yeah, we livin' it up, you know that this is my everything, I’m never givin' it up
All the time, all the—all the time (yeah, we do)
And now I feel like I wanna keep going, my cards never showing, don’t know what’s in hand
I love my fans, but this here girl want me, tell me I’m the man, I know I am
But never acknowledge it
Touring the country, I'm loving these colleges
Touching more pussy than a gynecologist
Study her body like I’m a biologist, with no apology
Baby girl follow me
She got low, blow my kiss of criminology
And she be loving the way I be flowing
And I know the infatuation is growing
If you catchin' feelings you better be slowin' it down
Slowin' it— Slow it down, down
'Cause we both know what happens when that love come around
You feelin' me, I’m feelin' you, I want you to be mine
Maybe one day it will be, but I don’t have the time

[Chorus]
Right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these mafuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd

[Verse 3]
Shorty say she love me and she know every word
To every song on every mixtape
"When your album droppin'? Tell me which date
Everything you say to me, I can relate
The fact that we met right here, right now on this night, it must be fate"
Now I’ll be damned, time moves so fast
Couple months back, I had a meeting with my last
Reminiscing 'bout love, discussing matters of the past
Looking in them eyes, but I’m thinking 'bout that ass
I took her for coffee, she took me for granted
Now I show no emotion and my shorty can't stand it
And now you know (And now you know)
I’m on my grind, I keep my exes in line like 'tic tac toe'
And I finally got 'em all up out my vision
However, I’m all they see when they turn on the television

[Chorus]
Right now
All these mafuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
Right now
All these mafuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd

Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights
No lights, all for this
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside
No ride in the wintertime, all for this
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this
Tell me what you know about family never there
But swear they deserve all of this
Tell me what you know about people tryna test you
Don't wanna get involved with this
X you out, you get solved with this
Everybody gotta evolve with this
Like bitch I bet I be at the place I said I'd be
Legendary like No I.D
You know I be duckin' every ho I see
Cause I'm out of this world, and I know I be like...

Living as a black man, in the skin of the white man
Everybody wanna fight man, and I put it on my right hand
Goddamn, it's all for this
I just wanna make the world a better place
Fuck race and the shade in my face
Looking for the sun but the shade in my face
Best in my field, I'm a slave to the race
Black motherfucker, white motherfucker
I don't give a damn what you is, can you write motherfucker?
Said I couldn't do it, said I wouldn't do it
I just made a million in a month, aight motherfucker?
I did everything I said I'd ever do and to you I still ain't shit?
Aight motherfucker
Runnin' around the world yelling P-L-P
But as a last resort, we gon' fight motherfucker like

[Intro: Michael Franks (Sampled)]
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at

[Verse 1: Logic]
From the back to the front door
Dealers on the Southside sellin on their front door
Little bit of weed, little bit of crack, whatever you need
While I'm sellin out shows in the ice cold
Shout out to the homies in the front row with the blunt rolled
That waited for hours in the snow just to see me flow
So you know I gotta stay after the show
'Cause if Chi-Town show love, I'ma show love
Outside, no gloves in the wintertime
'Cause I'm hungry like dinnertime
Stayin for every single one of my fans
Autographs till I couldn't feel my hands
Just a man with a plan, but you wouldn't understand
I get high by the notes, you get high by the gram
While you smoke to this
Reminisce when I wrote to this
Up-and-comers take note to this
We get it done on tour, waking up before the sundown
Lake Shore Drive shooting videos
On the block getting spotted by them city hoes (Hey!)
I know I never had to wonder if it's love or not
Shout-out to the homies up at Jugrnaut
For keeping a motherfucker fresh, hell yes
No contest when it comes to gear in the city they be the best
Love my girls outgoing in my City, Chi
But it's MD till the day I die

[Chorus: Logic]
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply

[Break: Michael Franks (Sampled)]
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at

[Verse 2: Logic]
Shout-out to the Bobby Soxer girls that just love the flow
Chillin out late night with the weed lit blunt split and the paper rolled
RattPack smoking loudpack yeah they 'bout that
Haters talking shit yeah I never doubt that
With the GPS flow we re-route that
Road to riches we be 'bout that
Getting money like Oprah
Fryin' motherfuckers like Okra
Put your L up if you be a smoker
Full-time toker
Everything I got that's what I'm given no division till it's over
Sleeping on the Young Sinatra like a sedative
Now they on a brother's dick, so repetitive
And they wonder why, and they wonder why

[Chorus: Logic]
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply
We get high

[Break: Michael Franks (Sampled)]
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
We get higher and higher



[Intro]
Is it still, is it going? (yeah yeah)
(Alright) So we gon’ do this one like for the RattPack and shit, is it recording?
Alright for the real hip-hop motha fuckas, you know what I’m sayin?
(Yeah Yeah) Shout out to Bobby, my engineer
It’s a nice night in L.A
We're recordin this mixtape and shit, workin on the album at the same time, you know what I’m sayin?
Visionary boy
Yeah yeah, uh, yeah, we gon’ do it for 96’ (yeah)
We gon’ do it for hip-hop (yeah second renaissance type shit check it)

[Verse 1]
Who would have thought that painting pictures ’bout being broke
Would get me riches like dealing coke
Like big brother used to do so we could stay afloat
I heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would tote
Thought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote
While they was firing, you could hear sirens
From people dialling and women crying in the phone
I was in the zone, trying to make a living
Heading to work in the morning
Everyday felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased
Until I quit my job, then my work ethic increased
Elevated to levels I ain’t ever seen
Stacking this cream, living the American dream now
I’m going crazy, I ain’t slept in days
Dreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J’s
Always shouting out my team ’cause I get all the plays
But they the ones that motivate me on depressing days
See I’m from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation
From the smallest altercation, that can lead to termination
With a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation
Passing bars back and forth like legal examinations
As a youngin I was running wild
Me and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud
Doing shit just to do it, ’cause we wasn’t allowed
I thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah
Now when my momma was at home drinking, thinking ’bout the bills
I was dreaming ’bout the mills, running round looking for thrills
I guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page
And paints a picture of another age
Back in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark
‘Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down
‘Til we get older and hustle, now they try’na gun us down
We just trying to make a living off of what we’ve been given
Wassup

[Hook]
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on

[Verse 2]
They call me Logic, yeah that’s L-O-G-I-C
I ain’t wrapped up in them bitches, I just write ’bout shit I see
‘Cause these lyrics set me free, fuck the world, let me be
And when I feel like I can’t write, that’s when I hit the MPC
My talent limitless, but time limited so listen up
If you can’t see the shit I see, you better get your vision up
I’m the king, watch me reign, born to rule my domain
Album ain’t even in stores, they trynna sue me for my name
Shit insane, so berserk, never complained, I just work
Chasing after my dreams like them high school skirts
Back as a youngin, spitting game, try’na get the nut in
Living life to the fullest ’cause them little things ain’t nothing
My flow un-killable when I be murdering syllables
But I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme
Perfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb
I be rapping ’til I’m dying, doing everything I love
That’s the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor
Try’na get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed
That’s the type of shit I need
Lyrics bleed from my mind state
Elevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate
‘Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low
And sometimes I do shit I thought I'd never do before
My life is like a movie role that’s starring me, got these women on me
I hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me
At the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot
Pretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips
Both my hands on her hips, ’til she puts them on her tits
Freak bitch want the dick, biting on her finger tip
I only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit
I’m thinking ’bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wilding out
But that pussy wet as hell, I think it’s time to end the drought
Then again she could be burning, and that’s not what I’m about
So I dipped out, to live another day and die another night
‘Cause when I’m gone that ain’t gon' be the song that they recite
Waddup



[Intro]
I know what it's like
To be all, all depressed
And not wanna go out and
And live life man
That's not healthy man
You can't be living like that what's wrong with you?

Hi
Yeah hey you, yeah you
Yea yea uh huh
I know you been feeling down
There's something's pissin you off
And something's wrong- you know what
We're gonna, I'm gonna cheer you up
I'm gonna help you out
Just go ahead and just
And just listen alright?
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Hi there hey friend how are you
Cheer on up you superstar you
Don't let them try you
Fuck that shit
Don't let them deny you
Cause you're gonna make it some day
And you're gonna make it some way
No more waitin for the bus
And no more riding on the subway
Live life how you want to
So get on up now go get out there
Face your fears
No need to be scared
You better rebel
And if they hate you give 'em hell
No more hiding in your shell
Cause we are not defined
By how hard we fall
So dust yourself off and stand tall
Cuz you can make it
Of this im sure
Just spread your wings
And you will soar

[Hook]
I know
I know, know
That I'm gonna blow
You away
And when I wake up
I'm gonna shake up
The fuckin' world
And you're gonna love me
You're gonna take me
As I am (as I am)
And not a single one of you
Can tell me no
Ohhhh yea

[Verse 2]
I'mma go where nobody before me has gone
And I know that the journey is gonna be long
Livin' life like a mademan like a don
I was in the dark but now all the lights on
It's real hard on the rise to fame
Cause everybody's mad and you're the one to blame
And just last year you didn't know my name - Logic
Now they all demand it
Used to hate me and I can't stand it
Cuz now you love me you so damn manic
Said I'll never make it said I'll fail
My ship would sink
But motherfucker I sailed
I know I'm gonna prevail
Eyes on the prize right on my trail
Middle finger to the haters that are on my tail
Cause I got heart boy I got spunk
Feelin' just like Jordan before the dunk
And if you fuck around I'mma put you in the trunk
*Ha* I'm just playin around
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Oooowwwwww

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I swear to God that I love the life I live
And I'm grateful for every breathe it gives
I remember thinkin' something's got to give
New day but it all just feels the same
No clouds but I can feel the rain
Pointin' fingers lookin' for someone to blame (lookin' for someone to blame)
'Til I came across my own name
I wasn't in control of my destiny
Feelin' empty thinkin where's the rest of me
I gotta make it but I need the recipe
Only then will I find the best of me
I didn't wanna listen, didn't give a fuck
I was so selfish, I was so stuck
Cleanin up food, for a little buck
Then I quit that, livin' on luck
I was so lost, at what cost
Why be the worker, when you could be the boss
Still doin' wrong, trynna live right
Get my mind righteous, man I what a fight
Shit gettin tight, man that ain't right
And my girl left, so I just might
So I just might
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
Happiness last, and uh
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa(ss)
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
Happiness last, and uh
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa(ss)



[Verse: Logic]
Seem like my whole life changed in the last year
At parties with legends like "what the fuck I’m doing here?"
Waiting for someone to say "what the fuck you doing here?"
Until I realized I belonged, had nothing to fear
Who would’ve thought I would mingle with celebrity singles
In a room full of Grammy winners discussing they singles
Some people love you, some people hate you
Some people need you, some people act like they know you
But they can’t even read you
The effort I put into music still the same amount
Cause ain't a damn thing changed 'cept the bank account
I remember the day I got my advance money
I’m talkin so much bread, this shit'll make you dance money
What's the first thing I did?
Got my team out the way and then I got myself a crib
My boy Lenny gave me a place to stay for a year
Put food in my stomach, I had nothing to fear
And once that 365 was up, I told him to quit his job
And gave him a new career
So many rappers on that stupid superstar shit
But I plan to eat with the people I starved with
I’ve made money, I’ve lost money, I’ve spent money
I've slept outside due to lack of the rent money
I’ve been in love, been happy, been through a lot of pain
Cause what the fuck is sunshine without a little rain?
And love is like leaves in the fall
Cause some people get scared and leave when you fall
Speaking of which, I met this girl the other day
The type of girl that make the pain fade away
And I have a feeling she gon' be my next
Cause she make me forget all about my ex
I’m talking something that’s deeper than just sex
But I don’t want her to be the third letter in the word next
Old soul in the sea of love
I’m just not current, none of the above
And man fuck all that depressing shit
Let’s get this money and fuck these bitches
You know what I’m sayin?
Sike nah, all of y'all just know that I’m playin
Cause all the money you possess
Ain’t what makes you a man
Big shot, tough guy, blow 100 grand
But you still in the same place, damn
But man the world is so fascinating
Ambition got these girls gravitating
And honestly it strokes the ego
But beautiful women ain’t good for nothing
Except procrastinating
I got a show in Paris coming up
Followed by London, I’mma tear it up
So many people just don’t care enough
Analyzing faces in the crowd staring up
What's the difference between me and them?
How come I ain’t in the crowd at they show seeing them?
What that guy see in me that he ain’t see in him?
Cause honestly I see no difference between me and him
We all people, all equal, we all the same
Lookin for control tryna play the game
We all got issues, just different magazines
We all sleep but have different dreams
However once you’re awake and your life ain’t what it seems
And that’s the reason I’m living within my own dream
Hell yea, fuck 'em all, like I’m runnin from the law
Haters probably think they phase me, I’m like no, not at all
I’m too high up, now to fall
Like a sphere, bitch I ball
Never asked me where my team at
Cause you know I brought em all
And if you’re looking for a problem then we can get it solved
I just kill them with kindness, keep it peace and it dissolve
You got bitches, I got Bobby Soxer girls that be ride or die
A shawty on another level, let me catch a vibe
Super bad girl, IQ is in the sky
She graduated cum laude, your bitch went to DeVry
God damn, oh girl, she a go getta
At the party takin shots like a Beretta
Doing anything and everything to feel better
And now she in the crib getting high like a falsetto
How you feeling, I be yelling
"Why these motherfuckers grilling?"
And she give me life ‘cause I’m making a killing
Bring it down, do it slow, show me how that really go
Girl I’m new in town, I don’t really know
They be like, when you gonna tell me that you love me?
I be like bitch I gotta hit the studio, ho
Now she got me on the crib, talkin that she wanna do it
Condom on the dresser looking at me like ain't nothing to it
Thinking should I do it though, I don't even know the ho
I don't even know the ho, I don't even know the ho

[Elijah Blake]
Sayin', "Oh, Mama I made it"
Oh, Mama I made it
You cannot tell me no
But the young boy made a way
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I said, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh



[Verse 1]
I don't know what I’ma do
I don't know where I’ma live
'Cause it feel like I ain't got nothing to give
Just wanna follow my dreams
Just wanna follow my heart
But the world wanna tear me apart right from start
Everything I ever wanted, it ain't what I thought
Bring it back to the roots like my name Black Thought
This shit right here, no it can't be taught
Gotta be learned, it gotta be earned
I ain't got a pocket full of money but I'm full of hope
I don't wanna rob people, I don't wanna push dope
I just wanna live, I just wanna maintain
Like a bullet to the brain
Gotta play the game like a chess board
If yah wanna go to war, gotta bring yah best sword
I feel like I'm going crazy, like I need a psych ward
Think my mind playing tricks on me like a Geto Boy
Feel like I need to murder 'em in the moment I deploy
Everybody, anybody, somebody fill the void, somebody fill the void
Listen, I don't wanna work a job, motherfuck a 9 to 5
Every time I get a check, what I really get? Robbed
Livin in America, this shit is a facade
But you gotta push through and persevere, word to God
Tryna find a home, but I can't afford a home
'Cause I'm 25 and owe a hunnid grand in student loans
Tryna get healthcare, but I'm on welfare
Man I swear to god, I wish I was living in Bel Air
Fuck Medicaid, I just wanna get paid
Wit' a couple bad bitches at the crib, gettin' laid
That's what I'm taught by the media
Television tellin' my vision to get greedier
Come now everybody stay tune like T-Pain
Operate the drive in yah mind like a keychain
Come now folk, get woke, stay woke
'Cause the white man want the black man stay broke
Fuck that, I'm finna buck back
But not wit bullets, I’ma use my education to the fullest
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
Do whatever you gotta do whenever to live
But you gotta remember to give back when you get that When you finally get to the top and you hit that pinnacle
I ain't being cynical, I'm just being real
I believe that everybody feel, everybody feel, listen up Everybody over here
I promise to God on everything it ain't nothing to fear Anybody that can hear, just fight
Fight for the right
Fight for ya life
Fight for what you believe is right
Fight for what you believe is right
Everybody fight
Everybody fight
Matter fact, everybody beautiful
But right, what now I need

[Outro]
Black people: to just fight, fight for ya right fight, for ya life
Black people: just fight, fight for the right, fight for ya life
Black people: are beautiful, incredible, amazing
Black people: intelligent, so elegant, it’s crazy

[Verse]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
At the party with my homies, walk up and they play my shit
On the road, kick a song, didn’t have to sell my soul
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
Where you stay, every day, just got my crib in LA
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck, y’all must not know what’s up
In the cut, we don’t give a fuck, we just trying to cut
Line em up, if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up
Rattpack, that’s a fact, basic bitch can’t fuck with that
Where you at? That’s what they be asking, I say on the map

[Bridge]
Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it
Living like we got it cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it

This album was created over the span of one year. However, the majority of the album was recorded in only two weeks



[Hook: Logic]
On the low, what's up with you ho
Bitches smokin' dro
Bet you know
Bust like forty four
When I spit that flow 'cuz we go hard
Like that shit they hustle on the boulevard
Fuck your broad
Bitch I bet I could, bitch I bet I would
On the low, what's up with you ho
Bitches smokin' dro
Bet you know
Bust like forty four
When I spit that flow 'cuz we go hard
Like that shit they hustle on the boulevard
Fuck your broad
Bitch I bet I could, bitch I bet I would

[Verse 1: Logic]
Lemme get it, lemme get it, lemme get it right now
That's the shit I've been on
R A double T P A C K
You know we (know we) shit on
Anybody in the way all day
I'm livin' my life boy you know to the fullest
These women, they love us, they push us and pull us
Just me and my team takin' shots without bullets
Gettin' this money, you know we don't bullshit
People they love it, they know the name
I got a little change, but I'm still the same
So break it down, break it down
The shit I'm rockin, they don't make it now
I've got haters and they talk shit
But that's okay, I've got real shit
That's heartfelt, make you feel shit
But right now it's time for that trill shit
Killers and murderers, dealers and burglars
Round my way, they never heard of you
From that West Deer Park
Where they kill after dark but that never occur to you
Been broke, dirt broke
While my brothers was hustlin' pushin' that coke
That's the life of a G, but it wasn't for me
And for real, that's the reason I wrote

[Hook: Logic]
On the low, what's up with you ho
Bitches smokin' dro
Bet you know

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
On the low, I be so high, touchin' the sky
I got a wood, so fuck the world, until I die
If you ain't know, it's Kid Ink baby, representin' Alumni
I'm off three shots but, you ain't hear the gun cock
Fat ass blunt nigga, yours looks sun dried
What it do, I'm on two
Tell 'em straight up, no juice
Never goin' back to the broke old days
But I've got a room full of retro J's
Never seen these, look back at it
I see your bank and I laugh at it
Blowin' kush up, like an air mattress
One hit will leave a nigga asthmatic
And we goin' up, ain't nobody sober
Know that molly, uncut, eighteen and over
Got three chains, two girls, hangin' over my shoulders
Give it up in one motion, know that money is the motive

[Hook: Logic]
On the low, what's up with you ho
Bitches smokin' dro
Bet you know
Bust like forty four
When I spit that flow 'cuz we go hard
Like that shit they hustle on the boulevard
Fuck your broad
Bitch I bet I could, bitch I bet I would
On the low, what's up with you ho
Bitches smokin' dro
Bet you know
Bust like forty four
When I spit that flow 'cuz we go hard
Like that shit they hustle on the boulevard
Fuck your broad
Bitch I bet I could, bitch I bet I would

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
My time, my time is now
I cannot wait
They say that love, it comes with hate
When I made it out the streets
Is when that love it turned to hate
I didn't turn up, I turned away
The time is short, no time to waste
All these niggas up in my face, they ain't my friends
All these niggas up in my face, they ain't my friends
I've got fam servin' fiends
And fiends I call my fam
If you wanna keep your bitch
Then make sure she don't cross my path
'Cuz if she do, she see my shoes
She peep my swag, she get online
Check my background
Bitch you seen that cash
My only motto about that money is get more
My only motto about that money is get more (mo', mo')

[Hook: Logic]
On the low, what's up with you ho
Bitches smokin' dro
Bet you know
Bust like forty four
When I spit that flow 'cuz we go hard
Like that shit they hustle on the boulevard
Fuck your broad
Bitch I bet I could, bitch I bet I would
On the low, what's up with you ho
Bitches smokin' dro
Bet you know
Bust like forty four
When I spit that flow 'cuz we go hard
Like that shit they hustle on the boulevard
Fuck your broad
Bitch I bet I could, bitch I bet I would

Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

(Fight!)

[Verse 1: QuEst]
Chip on my shoulder, fuck is you sayin' ?
Swear to God our fathers were playing nigga relay the message
Breathless, every morning was forced to skip on breakfast
Mama told me don't let these peasants throw rocks at the king
Pawns tend to carry on with no conscience
Straight non-sense, pay homage or K's vomit, verbal
Fucker wanna know Biggie was making certain while niggas was getting iffy
Heart is bigger than derrières of Vicky and Nicki
But fuck up and diss me, this shit will 360
And must I mention my body count?
It's murderous, to be humble
Murder is to be humble?
Ever heard of me stumble?
I was born in the jungle where niggas belly's will rumble
Get checked for thinking or mumble
But y'all still stuck on rap
Fuck all that
I do this in my slumber, merely ventilation
Tryna stay afloat be on a boat shit
I swear that I'm lost inside of the spirit of Biggie back in his lumberjack
Or Nasir with the fatigue, I felt stifle, street's disciple
My raps are trifle, I shoot slugs for my...you get the picture
I was raised in Miami, niggas'll smack your coofie
Just for acting coochie, your goofy actions'll never move me
No sir, needy no, all my homies is ready to roll
Never the matter the chitter and chatter
I did it cause I can machete the flow
And comeback, here's a fun fact
I'm not a dumb act, run that
Little punk rat, fuck it, Pun's back
In the middle of Little Havana
Holding a hammer outside with pajamas
Better watch your grammar around me
These haters surround me, I swear it's unnecessary
Gambino, you childish niggas could never see the shit that I do
VMG, yes nigga VMG
Only competition that we see is TDE

[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

Happy birthday to my nigga doe
(Fight!)

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
Imma be the guy that rap slow, sike nah
Dictating bitches and smoking Cubans, I'm Castro
My life is like the movie, and I'll be the director
And just to get a small role, got bitches acting extra
I wrote this verse in one minute cause Bobby said that he wants rhymes
Intelligent, but I'm getting brain from bitches that's dumb fine
Got punchlines like prom with the, world on my palm
I knew that we would blow up cause bitch, we be the bomb
Rattpack out to get the cheese, drop a verse get fifty Gs
Hit the studio drunk as fuck but still drop a verse with ease
I don't give a fuck
Bitch you know the flow is second nature
With no pen and paper break it down disintegrate a hater, wassup

[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

(Fight!)

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion]
Let's have a money conversation
Four hundred thousand from Eminem that's a payment
Kennedy Reagans presidential arrangement
Please don't let this Pop kid take it back to the basement
I'm still here screaming Beautiful Mind
Sick of the noodles of rhyming all my cubical grind
So I just grew and decided to put you in your spot
Ooodles and boodles of blue bags from Louis Vuitton
Getting money with lawyers we have a Jew of a time
With liquor in a Poland Spring like a Junior at prom
Yes I chose to pop charts I'm doing the crime
And that just means I'm fucking dope to you and your mom
Working in the summer, AC on freezing
Working in the winter like I got no heaters
Spring rolls at the damn four seasons
In the Red Octobers screaming thank you Yeezus

[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

(Finish him!)

[Verse 4: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Chilling with me and my Tribe
Gotta spit this to survive
How long have I been alive?
Twenty-four years and counting not including my momma womb
I'm here in the lab, and I'll be here until the tomb
Album coming soon watch the Rattpack consume
Aye, yo, yeah
I've been on that real shit
That fun shit
Spit artillery, like a gunship
V's up we run shit
Don't come around with that dumb shit it's scandalous
In the studio in Los Angeles
At No I.D. spot hit you with the heat rock goddamn
With Bobby on the board everybody on the floor
Hold up let me take a breath here come more
This a freestyle let me redirect my intellect
Drop this shit just for fun, it's all over the internet
Cause bitch I'm in effect
Wait hold up, y'all did get the Memo?
You Lumbergh rappers is Initech
Bitch I've been a fact
Hit you like Hiroshima then intercept
Check it yo
See now all the real fans know the album goin be crazy
Spit it off the top and get dirty like Pat Swayze
From the cover of XXL
Fuck around and then propel
Tour coming soon man I know the tickets finna sell
Really, coming for everybody's Achilles
Put my own money into this album, like half a milli
It's Logic, coming for their neck no disrespect
I did this shit in two minutes or less
Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect (Sinatra)
Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect
This is Logic

(Flawless Victory)
Happy birthday to me motherfucker
It's my birthday!

I'ma keep this short
I am, ah
Currently on my...
My world tour
For The Incredible True Story
Uh, don’t think too much into this shit, man
Just have fun with it, it’s that simple
I just wanna turn up
It’s crazy to think I’m currently on this tour
I’m working on two albums
The first of which that you will hear
Just know that
After this turn up shit
After this fun shit, yo, man
You’re in store for something special
Don’t think too much, man, just shut the fuck up and enjoy it

[Segue: John Lindahl]
Ahhh bro
It’s been a hell of a ride up
It’s been a hell of a ride up



[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah, alright, yo— couple days ago
I met the illest latina her demeanor was unexplainable
You shoulda seen her, thick thighs, nice ass
Body like an hourglass didn’t hesitate to break a brother neck
Second she passed I was like, “What’s up?”
To which she replied, “How you doin’?”
I said de nada momma
But your beauty I’m persuin’
And I said I’m about to win the lottery
She asks “How?”
I said, “Your seven digits right now”
And made her smile
Now we conversing
And she feelin’ my style
I can tell by the way she talkin’
That she down to go the mile
Had a couple drinks
Now we headed back to her place
The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face
I’m tryin’ to hit, split it
Baby girl you gonna let me get it?
She said, “Hold up ok, I don’t get down like that”
I said I know beautiful girl
But I get down like that
So let me heat it up, heat it up
Go crazy and beat it up
“Damn papi, how you even know I like it rough?”
The way you was feelin’ on me
When kissing revealed enough
I wanna scratch you, provoke you
Bite you, choke you
But just a little, bite your legs
Dig up in the middle
“Hold up, wait a second
Nigga, you gotta condom?”
Come on beautiful girl of course I’ve got protection
I stay with Magnums and I ain’t talkin’ Smith and Wesson
I keep undressin’
Girl I’m about to teach you a lesson
After I hit it she says
“Bobby I have a confession
I think I love you!”
I said “ What the fuck?”
Thinkin’ to myself
Damn, I shoulda never cut
Kissed her on the cheek
Hit the lights, then she fell asleep
So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like
(The next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, yo
The next day, the next day, the next)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah, yeah, yo
Now I’m out the door
Downtown is where I’m about to go
Got a meeting with my boy Chris
About a dope show
So I hail a cab, jump in
But so does some girl
Beautiful, pretty eyes
With luxurious curls
I said “No fair”
She smiled and said
“Why don’t we share?”
What a success
Lookin’ at her chest
Thinkin’ if her breasts was a test
She would fail
Fresh tip nails
Type of ass make a brother
Train of thought derail
As we converse
I could tell that she feelin’ my style
Get the pussy wet
That’s the mission
As long as she listen to my words
Feelin’ on the curves
Only lips I’m thinkin’ bout kissin’ is hers
I can barely fight the urge
Only thing that matter right now
Is these two verbs
I’m talkin’ me and you
So fine, I’d think I’d start seeing you
Her body was a work of art
Like Hieroglyphics
Too much detail to go into specifics
Now
I’m diggin’ shorty
Like an archeologist
Tryin’ a bone
Searchin’ for a queen to take the throne
The type of girl to love
And call her my own

[Verse 3: Logic]
I’m just a bachelor (bachelor)
Looking for a bachelorette
Baby, maybe you can persuade me
To give you love
You couldn’t imagine yet
Kiss you on the neck
Then I sedate the pussy like a vet
Got the shorty rollin’ like a movie set
Take her to the Rio
I’m not talking about G-burg
I’m talking De Janeiro
Spend dinero like its reverb
Expansion
Couple kids running round the mansion
Day dreamin’
Getting ahead of my self
Advancin’
But, come on.. girl
Now come and give me love
I know we just met but
Romance is like a drug
You know we go together
Like sympathy and hugs
So I write this girl
A symphony
And tell her that I love
Her everything
Girl I love your everything
You know I love your everything
I said I love your everything
Yeah, love your everything
Girl, I love your everything



[Intro (Acapella): Logic]
I’m on the come up
Anything that y'all do I'll one-up
Y'all grind till like 3 in the morning; I grind till the sun up
Homie, that’s dedication
This world is what I’m facing
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace him

[Hook]
(I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song)
Momma I’m sorry that I left at 17
(I apologize a trillion times)

[Verse 1: Logic]
Everything ain’t what it seem when you try and follow your dreams
First you saw the bigger picture
Now you see behind the scenes
You thought everything was sweet
Now you see that shit is mean
Got a taste now you a fiend
Been into it since a teen
Yeah he nice so all his friends say he gon’ blow like Hiroshim'
Eyes on the prize like the baddest bitch you ever seen
At home late night, chillin, envisioning
Himself on the cover of Vibe magazine
But everything ain’t what it seems
Though it seem like he gon’ blow
Will he make it?
Maybe so
Too be honest I don’t know
He got lyrics, he got flow
But it takes so much mo'
So much love
So much pain
With such little time to grow
Yeah we love it when he smile
But hate it when he frown
Remember when that girl turned his world upside down
But it made his music better
Brought emotion made it clever
Now he growing everyday
But he hungry tryna eat
Brain like an EKG the way that he study the beat
Now we know that he gon’ make it and he won’t accept defeat
Now I ain’t tryin to be mean
Now I ain’t tryin to be mean
But everything ain’t what it seem

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Logic]
So many times did I design a rhyme to blow your mind
Cos I know that I wasn’t destined to live a life of crime
I remember Christmases with no presents
I use to fear my future now I dread my adolescence
Living the life of Logic
But it ain’t what it’s cut out to be
Cos if I couldn’t rap y'all wouldn’t give a fuck about me
Hip hop is politics
Filled with nothing but strife and stress
Time is money and it’s hard to invest
Step on the stage I get the honeys so wet
Rockin' thousand-dollar tuxes, sippin' on nothing but Moet
Thinking I’m so set, but really I ain’t done shit yet
This game is war and in my mind I’m like a Vietnam vet
Now, I’m on the come up
Anything that y'all do I’ll one-up
Y'all grind till 3 in the morning; I grind till the sun up
Homie, that’s dedication
This world is what I’m facing
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace him

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
For the motherfuckers that hated: I made it
Slowly elevated, escalated onto another level, ha
My flow is crack the game is Whitney, yeah
Fame is Bobby on their first date: it ain’t hit me yet
Visualizing driving down the horizon
While you despising the fact that I’m rising
So much hate within this world this shit is so traumatizing
Steppin to me yeah you better be alphabetically ready
Aim steady
Lyricism sharp as machete
I got it already
See I was born to sell records
You was destined to sell tunes
All up your headphones
Killing booths like cellphones
(I got it)
Cos everything ain’t what is seems
It ain’t just him it takes a team
At the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean
Yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety
So truly he is me and motherfucker you can’t face me
Now I’ve had a lot of doubt
But I had to throw that out
Cos I find that they listen when I rhyme not when I shout
And right now shit is rocky
With me and my girl
See music is my moon but this shawty is my world
Think about you all the time
Turn that shit into a rhyme
Cos sometimes you can ignore me
But the beat listens just fine
Tell me do you even know
If you truly want to grow
Hate letters when I’m writing Love Jones all I know
Cos everything ain’t what it seems

[Hook]

[Verse 4 (Acapella): Logic]
Living a life you only dream about
Flow angelic but now it’s time to bring the demon out
Can you feel me?
I said it’s hard being a saint inside a sinner’s body
You know its hard living as Logic after living as Bobby
This is the life I depicted
As a child I picked it
Feeling conflicted
To music I am addicted
Not one of y'all can predict it
So many bars I’m feeling convicted
Now writing like a felon I’m selling homie who you telling
While y'all do everything by the book fuck that I’m rebelling
Bitch I’m on another level
A level you ain't seen
A level that is truly only deemed for a king, cos
The second you listen it’s my mission to murder any rendition
Busting with precision
If you in my vision I’m never missing
Logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener
Can you motherfuckers feel me?



[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah, pass the mic before I jack it like gore-tex
Bust like raw sex, rappers suck like vortex
The life of a Don- We living like kings, and killing our pawns
Boy, the seconds it’s on, don’t know where we going
I’m flowing and killing this shit from dusk til dawn
Just had sex with a Middle Eastern girl- The pussy was bomb
That last line made no sense like these rappers’ careers
But I make dollars, cause I’m all about the fiscal year
Yeah; you don’t like me? I’ll conjure up and summon all your fears
You wanna fight me? I’ll woop my own ass before you get here
Wanna write me? And tell me that my rhymes suck?
Bitch I don’t give a fuck, I’ll stab you in the gut, call it a tummy tuck
You can ask my ex, I bust quicker than two techs
Caressed by a kid with category 5 tourettes
In other words I squeeze with ease, dot my I’s and cross my T’s
I’m a perfectionist; the lesson is fuck everyone assessing this
It’s hip-hop, not to be taken literally
However on the light of note I stayed with bills like Hillary
My flow convects, murder subjects with little respect
Best protect your neck, before you play my tape better inspect the deck
Fuck every other rapper forever ever forever since the dawn of time
Sike- I’m not that much of a dick when I rhyme
On another level like duplex, bust heads like suplex
Slaughter MC’s then ask who’s next…

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
Ey yo my crew next, but you say you next, so I guess we now
Priceless flow so even If I write it’s still a freestyle
Never busting gats I ain’t no gangster put that heat down
Then go and grab a mic and see if you can fuck with me now
I got that A plus flow I’m on a roll bitch I can’t fail
Making money with my mind, call that shit a brain sell
Raise hell, like I’m Satan’s daddy while you in here
Catch me in a tenant caddy with a bitch from Cincinnati
With the thickest fatty while I hit the gas, you lick it gladly
With the window down see other bitches blowing kisses at me
It’s a fact that me and Logic rip with vicious rap to list a wrap
We spittin’ crack to keep the fiends, coming back to show world
Reppin Maryland but I make music for the whole world
Seduce a chick with lyrics whenever she hear it, it make her toes curl
So sick I hope I don’t hurl, if you love me let me go girl
Cause no pussy come before my flow, just had to let you know girl
Spit it so thorough and in depth, I bet I leave you impressed
Rattpack be my family, I fuck with y’all no incest
Only interest is to blow up, and watch they hands go up
Cause I used to throw shows back then but no one would show up
I ain’t all about the money but I want it homie sho' nuff
Cause krispie crazy bout’ the cream, you could say I’m dough nuts

[Verse 3: Logic]
I murdered my manager Chris last night
We exchanged a couple words, he said some things I didn’t like
I said okay…then punched him in the face with a butcher knife
I want more like Ashton Kutcher’s wife
Now can you feel it? They won't [Sinatra]
Gimme what I want, so fuck it I’ma steal it
I’ll dilapidate you, grab the butter knife and decapitate you
Yeah that’s what I said – huh, and bitch I did it
We all have thoughts like this; I’m just willing to admit it
I would never act upon these thoughts now, don’t you get it?
It’s like when a gentleman sees the baddest bitch and thinks, “I’d hit it!”
But he never says it; I’ll dump your body in a dessert
It’s the wrath of a psychopath clutching a razor blade in a bath
Having his last laugh, anticipating a gash- the other night I murdered captain crunch
Right in front of Toucan Sam and a whole damn bunch
That’s life, what can I say? I’m a cereal killer, venereal dealer
And yes you know they ain’t none other iller
It’s Logic



Pt. I: Common Logic

[Intro (Sampled)]
May I ask in what way your life is contributing to society as you sit here day after day after day in this dark room, stringing along on that stupid guitar? Have you ever thought about that? What are you doing for the world or for other people? Day after day, hour after hour, night after night

[Verse 1: Logic]
Me and my homies just chillin' feelin' the vibes
This the time of our lives but many don't realize
Havin' visions of livin' on another level, never signed to the Devil
The rebel that be fuckin' 'round with the treble
Bumping Tribe in the system like penicillin, motherfucker
I'm killing, spittin' venomous never remember this it's like a system
Say it then I do it, I never missed 'em
Fuck 'em after I kissed 'em, sit back and listen
My chain, it glisten, it's like I'm from another dimension
Did I mention my circle's smaller than an intervention
Then some beautiful women tell me I'm handsome
Then I snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
I fuck 'em until inside they belly burst
Stop it, drop the beat and then we cue the verse
Spitting lyrics like how a Mac-11 really disperse
Slaughter MCs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
They say I got too many styles, bitch I've been diverse
They scared to jump in the cypher, I be all up in it first
My apologies but if you're after me then it gets worse
When I come through I spit voodoo and leave 'em cursed, common logic

Pt. II: Midnight Marauder

[Interlude (Sampled)]
Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program. Midnight Marauder. Midnight Marauders. Midnight Marauders. Music

[Ad-Libs: Logic]
Sounds like some... some '90s shit. It's a good farewell... I suppose

[Hook: Logic]
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat my self just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the Rattpack, in other words the tribe that's next

[Verse 2: Logic]
It's been a long time and I ain't even in my prime
I remember many moons ago spitting the realest lines
On the come up, matter fact it was long before that
Before I bought my first mic, before I could afford that
This is a letter to the underground, the place where I'm from
This is a letter to the fans that understand what I've done
And even though I gotta leave man don't none of y'all grieve
'Cause even in the mainstream that lyricism I breathe
Some of y'all love my raw records, some of y'all don't
Some of y'all will love my radio shit, some of y'all won't
Just like my race, my music has always been yin and yang
Something for everybody, no not just one lane
And on the real, I'll never forget the day I got my deal
Full creative control and the money was unreal
Started from the bottom and got here 'cause of my skill
And I never set a goal that I didn't plan to fulfil

[Hook: Logic]
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the Rattpack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the Rattpack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest
Yeah, yeah, this the realest
The realest, say what? Say what?
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the Rattpack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the Rattpack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the Rattpack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest
This is the realest

[Outro (Sampled)]
You're not any less of a man if you don't pull the trigger. You're not necessarily a man if you do. This concludes Midnight Marauder program. Press any key to return to the main menu

[Ad-Libs: Logic]
I hope y'all understand. Y'all get it. Just havin' fun, you know what I mean? Enjoy the music, that's what it is. It ain't [?], it's just good fucking music. Yeah boy



[Verse 1]
Multi-million dollar deals
Got a million dollar deal
When I was younger
I would wonder how a million dollars feel
And forreal, it feel like I ain't even broke the seal
Cause when you drop hits they want you to pick up the bill
Now my, life is in Maryland
My heart is in Chicago
New York state of mind but out LA man that's where I go
When I need to lay this shit down
So much on my mind that's the reason I'm spitting now
Finally running the game and everybody tripping now
But I can't give a damn I got they bitches dripping now
Moet we sipping now
Yeah we came a long way
I know a lot of people thought they'd never see the day
That we get big like Notorious
Cause we battle like warriors
In the state of euphoria
My team is so fucking glorious
So I'mma love life while you live life
Cause I ain't perfect but I do my best to live it right, yeah

[Hook]
Are you ready to go
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Verse 2]
I should have took the time to understand the world
But I was just too busy tryna understand them girls
I never told anyone but I asked my ex to marry me
A couple months later the bitch buried me
And I know what y'all thinking
Logic, there's still hope
Keep yo chin up mothafucka
Ain't no reason to mope
Plus you got a lot of money and your music is dope
What's all the money in the world if yo heart still broke
But let's get back to the subject cause I was off of the topic
Hand me the mic and I rock it
They say they hate it then jock it, shit
I remember no heat in the winter time
Now that I'm eating haters griling me like dinner time
Tryna make a living off of what we've been giving
Since a younging I've been driven
Just tryna do it how I do it, huh
From my city, to your city, to Chi city
We blowing up at high velocity, wadddup

[Hook]
Are you ready to go
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready



[Verse 1: Logic]
Various women I'm swimming in like a shark
Hold up, that was the first one
Let me run it back and restart
Young Sinatra ripping the beat apart
Shining like a diamond
When I be rhyming
But y'all in the dark
On point like a poisonous dart
I can feel it now
The fame is coming soon
How can sky be the limit when there's footprints on the moon
Now, I used to bus tables now I bust rhymes
Spitting lines to the illest of dimes
Just to pass the time
Living like a Don
Mafietic mind state
Hip-Hop heads never die, we multiply then dominate
Now I been flowing since a adolescent up until the present
Rehearsing flows for various shows
Yeah that's how I roll
Getting respect and never neglect
That as I infect, they detect it, and when I dissect
Rip it and wreck it now
Thats on the record
As the vinyl spin so slowly
Bringing verses like a Holy
Bible, my flow is tribal
Meet me in the street homie I'm liable
To get it right then and there
Mother fuckers like where
He come from
Got music for days and then some
They were stepping confident until I made 'em run
You know it's Logic
In your vacinity murder evil entities
Better known as your enemies
You feel it now
Spark the L and you be coolin'
Chillin' relaxin' to this audio satisfaction
I leave MC's missin' in action
Leave you gashin
From a thousand lashes
Why I'm laughing with a passion
Standing over you smiling
Til I hear sirens then I'm dashing

[Hook: AZ & Nas]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought the bottle
Coulda struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days and plus some

[Verse 2: Logic]
This second verse is dedicated to rappers that never made it
Cause they gave up on their dream
In other words they hesitated to take it
But I swear I'mma make it better than ever before
Cause half of y'all don't even know
See I be rolling through the streets
In a beamer bomber like Hiroshima
Gonna hit you like Katrina until they like "Damn Gina!"
I eat MCs like fast food
Hella rude
I'm the reason that your favorite rapper's in a bad mood
My name is Logic
I was born in 1990
Ain't no need to remind me
That when you listen you wanna rewind me
All the labels wanna sign me
For the right reason
We aim to please
Hunting dollars and it's buck season
Cuz

[Outro: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
Thats why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die



[Intro]
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!

[Verse 1]
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky
I'll be damned if I ain't living the life I always wanted
Started from the bottom as a youngin gettin' blunted
Now I run it like a marathon, hoe, yeah it's on, hoe
Hits motherfucker, hits, Barry Bonds, hoe
In the studio for twenty-two days
I'm too paid, might fuck around and kick flip in my new J's
I got a show in Paris then Tokyo so I'm Lu-paid
Fucked a shorty in Paris, I'm getting crème brûlée

[Chorus 1]
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream

[Verse 2]
How you feeling, hoe?, I'm making a killing, hoe, really doe
Talking all that shit behind my back just like a silly (Hoe)
Had a dream: Dr. King, now that money ain't a thing
I've been through a lot of pain, looking like we overcame
Goddamn, life just ain't the same, all y'all know my name
Fuck the fame, Maryland where I came, broke up in the game
And it feel good, good, real good, good
Now we livin' in the hills pissing off the neighborhood
It's just me, Castro and 6ix, going crazy in this bitch
Plus my homie Jon, and the whole RattPack, you know we on
Livin' the life of a don while my homie, Slay, roll up the swisher
I get richer while they hate, watch the money gravitate
Finally eatin', grab a plate, hell yeah, that's sounding great
I've been high, I been low, but there's one thing that I know:
It's been a long time coming, now my whole team got it
And if you hatin', suck a dick and bitch about it

[Chorus 2]
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seem
When you following your motherfucking dreams, yeah

[Interlude: Richard Pryor (Sampled)]
You know it's funny doe, man, white people be frontin'
And you ever noticed like you'd be the only nigga some place
And you go where white people, they be like:
"You wanna move out of the way fellas? Excuse me, thank you very much - taking up all the fucking area, Jesus Christ!"
I love when white dudes get mad and cuss
'Cause you all are some funny motherfuckers when you cuss!
They be saying shit like "Alright, cut the shit! Fucking jerk off!"

[Chorus 2]
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seem
When you following your motherfucking dreams, yeah



[Intro]
Sinatra
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it over here
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it all here
Just me and my homies livin' life over here
Couple bad bitches down to ride, oh yeah
I know that I got it if I take my time
I know that I got it, everything will be fine
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it over here
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you know about the come up
While you at the party I be workin' 'til the sun up, yeah
I just wanna live my life, and give you everything that I can give, alright, alright
Me and my homies live in Hollywood, but that don't mean we hollywood
And if I could reply to every fan, hell yeah, you know I probably would
Live life 'til I overdose I said it once, had to say it dos
I remember livin' at Mary Jo's, now I'm living like pharaohs
I work like a slave, live like a king
'Cause in the end I promise money ain't a thing

[Hook]
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it over here
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it all here
Just me and my homies livin' life over here
Couple bad bitches down to ride, oh yeah
I know that I got it if I take my time
I know that I got it, everything will be fine
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it over here
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I just wanna do it right
I just wanna go tonight
Gettin' lost in the city lights
Gettin' lost in the pretty lies
Yeah, shout out to Maryland, shout out Chicago
Shout out beautiful women that follow where I go
'Cause I know I got no time for these fake hoes and these fake rhymes
We live it up in these great times
Always on my mind, this is real life
Okay, I guess this is what it feels like
Just me and my homies, do you realize?
This the type of shit I used to prophesize
Eyes on the real, though
All y'all probably duck down on the real low
I switched it up the day I got a deal, yo
But I'm bringin' that real flow
And of course a little bit of melody, guess I got the appeal, though
But don't ever think I'll be sacrificin' with the skill, though
I said I'm bringin' that real flow
I 'member comin' up real po'
Now let me bring it in real slow

[Hook]
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it over here
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it all here
Just me and my homies livin' life over here
Couple bad bitches down to ride, oh yeah
I know that I got it if I take my time
I know that I got it, everything will be fine
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it over here
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it, oh yeah

[Outro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah



[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'ma get it right now, and never will I give up
Homie, this is food for thought, you better fill up
I'm coming in strong but this song ain’t very long
So I gotta make you understand before the beat is gone
Homie you are not alone, we are in the zone
We are in The Matrix, full of that fake shit
Make you wanna grab the gat and go ape shit
Living in a world of lies I can't take it
Needed someone to save me, Needed someone to hug me
Needed a whole world but nobody would love me
And I learned from this that people wanna buck me
And I've learned from this, to put no one above me
I said I can't take it I know I'm gonna make it
I know I'm not normal but I gotta fake it
I swear I'm not cocky, I am just confident
That when I step on the stage I am dominant and now I am beggin'

[Hook]
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' You
Put your loving hand out darling

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
Sick of living in the dark so I'm begging for the light
Feeling like I'm in a fight every single time a write
Cause I gotta make sure that they hear me right
Told me that I couldn't do it so when I pick up the mic
I gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it
They can feel what's in my soul
Lyrical cokehead yeah homie I gotta blow
But first they gotta know who I is
So I'm begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big
Cause I ain't new to this I'm true to this
Thinking I'mma stand up and roll out Homie that's ludacris
Not here to play no games, I’m here to stay and make a change
In major ways so I remain
Up in the studio for days and days
Spittin' out these razorblades, don't wanna place no blame
But without you, I couldn't get to where I'm heading
So to everybody, I'm begging

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Yeah, Yeah, I said this is my path don't mess with me
I didn't choose this life it was destiny
God tested me to find the best of me
And I know I'm going to make it even without a degree
Cause the test scores don't mean shit to me
And when you said that I would fail it didn't get to me
Now I'm begging, public masses, please
I'm way too proud to get down on my knees
But I'm begging, put me on the level
Fuck Illuminati, that's word to the devil
Cause I am not about that, I just wanna love
I just wanna grow, I just wanna learn
The passion, it burns to write this music
I'm so late that I just might lose it
But don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it
I just wanna help hip-hop, not hurt it
And as for my style I don't know how to word it
Why do you even have to categorize me?
Fuck it let 'em hate, let 'em all despise me
Cause I'm gonna take this, flip it up and make this
Something that the whole word cannot imagine
Let alone fathom I'm from another planet
I swear I'm not manic, listen to me dammit
My future's in your hands and so I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
Ayy girl, it's obvious you fine
I just wanna know what's deep inside your mind, maybe we could
Play girl, I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand, but I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
Ayy girl, I could give you my number
You could give me whatever, we'll have a hell of a time

[Verse 1]
What up, baby girl? Won't you come here
I put it on my life I seen you somewhere, where you stay at? I'll come there, ha
Ain't no stalking shit, I just wanna talk and shit
Maybe grab a bite then after walk a bit, I just wanna converse
Come on, baby, ain't no need to disperse
Shorty got that type of beauty that inspired this verse, so wassup?
I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't wanna cut, but
It's deeper then that, getting knee deep in the cat
I'm looking for that ride or die type of women, it's what ever
I could be your King, you could be my Coretta
Ain't no better, get you wetter, fuck 'em all
Think outside the box, baby girl, you know I ball
Yes, you know I want it all, so make that shit a double
This is Young Sinatra and I'm rising from the rubble
People never say what's on their mind, I'm like "Fuck a muzzle"
'Cause I got the feeling you're the missing piece to my puzzle

[Chorus]
Ayy girl, it's obvious you fine
I just wanna know what's deep inside your mind, maybe we could
Play girl, I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand, but I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
Ayy girl, I could give you my number
You could give me whatever, we'll have a hell of a time

[Verse 2: Logic]
Whatever she wants I let her pick it like a fence from the suburb
Everything coach but her plane ticket, ya heard?
We real all the time, that's my word
Catch me in the cut tryna book her like a nerd
She a red bone bobby-soxer, I had to stop her
Ha, shorty a dime, so you know I'm tryna cop her
Pop a bottle at our table periodically
Now check the science of that last line, do it logically, no stoppin' me, I
Bet she woulda never guessed I never graduated
'Cause the way I put my words together she infatuated
Mama, I don't want no drama and I'm serious
Pause like a comma 'fore I end it like a period, now
Girl, don't treat me like your ex-man
I'm a beast on the track, but if I am your next man
I'ma treat you tender
Take it slow like one video render
I remember when I seen you for the first time
It was special like when I wrote my first rhyme
So if all I do is grind and never sleep
Then how in the hell is me and the girl of my dreams supposed to meet?

[Chorus]
Ayy girl, it's obvious you fine
I just wanna know what's deep inside your mind, maybe we could
Play girl, I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand, but I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
Ayy girl, I could give you my number
You could give me whatever, we'll have a hell of a time



[Intro]
"Now some guys they just hate for no reason, capiche?"
Ay yo 6ix, This shit is crazy right? Remember when we used to be in Lenny’s basement and shit? Now where we at? The Come Up
"Fuck yo money, fuck yo jewelry, fuck yo cars
Fuck all yo bitches that you got
It's obsolete, now
All that shit ain't fresh no more, fuck all that"

[Verse 1]
On the real homie, on the real
Tell me how you feel
Everything I spit is gold like I got a grill
Bet you people talking thought I'd sell out once I got a deal
Still me and my team, only difference - we live in the hills
We living a dream, these bitches perpetrating the skills
At the soup kitchen with my mama they giving us meals
I was poor in my adolescence but now I'm getting mills
Come on, tell me how it feels when that brand new record spills
Homie this the come up
I'm from where them drug dealers will run up
But I was never bout that shit, I just worked till the sun up
Oh yeah
Claiming that they got it over there
But they never had it over there
Motherfucker this the come up

[Hook]
Came a long way, this the come up
Been a long time coming, it's the come up
Been a long damn time, it's the come up

[Verse 2]
Open your mind, this is work ethic
Ninety-nine percent of you couldn't comprehend the method
Cause you too wrapped up in the money and bitches
I get riches but never sacrifice the art
Been real from the start, now break it down
That super-duper-killer flow
All these bitches in here make you wanna kill a ho
It's kind of funny how the flow make me sound ignant
But you know the wordplay on another level, isn't it?
I been at it since a young'n on a dolo
Till I got a team and said bye to doing it solo
Bad bitches wanna fuck me on the low though
Tryna' break the ice she like, "Can I get a photo?"
A long time comin', what you call that?
Shorty blowin' up my phone, I promise to call back
Unless you a crazy ass bitch
I'mma tell your ass to fall back
This the come up

[Hook]
Came a long way, this the come up
Been a long time coming, it's the come up
Been a long damn time, it's the come up

Maybe baby
Logic



[Produced by 6ix]

[Verse 1: Logic]
I hope you feel this shit
Top ten flow and it's still this shit
Went away, had to get away
Been away, came back and a motherfucker still the shit
Hold up, what's real as this?
Feelin' myself, who ill as this?
Mastered the flow from the east to the west
But right now I'm wondering how trill is this
I've been around for a minute now
One hunnid, I'm in it now
People that wasn't there back in the day talkin' bout
Man, remember I'm winning now
I could only imagine if I was beginning now
Back in the beginning now
Fuck that
Spent a mil' on the chain and I tell my company deduct that
Get the fuck back

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
First off I give a fuck about all that top five if I ain't in it
Niggas barely ever play my records (It don't matter)
But I'm still winnin' from the M-I-crooked
Just to make 'em peep what I'm cookin', I love Mississippi
I put a studio in my partner kitchen
So by the way I'm whippin you would think I'm juggin' these hoes
Cuttin' crack and make 'em double back like excuse me nigga
I need a stove, nah, I ain't selling dope
But this a metaphor for my flow
But I'mma probably have to hit with a fork (maybe dumb it down)
'Til it bubble up and then rise some more
So I can bag it up for these insta folk
And sell it for the low cause they simple
If I hear "KRIT, you need a hit" one more time
Lookin' at us like "how these motherfuckers gon' undership mine?"
Still do an interview here and there
Where they don't even know that I'm signed
(Nigga you had to know that)
If I wait on the label to support my vision I might go blind
Lately I've been on my tell it all get rich
Start plottin' on my way I did
To show like Empire may the very thing I dreamed of look like bullshit
Kill em all, why not, King when I'm busy
Krizzle up in the blizzard and the cold is the  [?]
Said who was here, never really snowed in the sizzie
Fuck what ya heard, multi 'til I dizzie, bitch!

[Verse 3: Logic]
Aight, check it, it's the take
I heard y'all been checking my net worth
What the fuck is y'all doing?
Y'all ain't on my level, boy, go pay your rent first
And then maybe I'll sign you
I'm looking for talent, I hope that I find you
(Wait a minute, you asked me now let me tell you
Now here's another problem)
They probably expecting that shit for the first album, man fuck that
They'll say that I changed
And I'll say I had to show 'em my range
Cause if I do what I did then they'll say it's the same
Just can't win in this game
Money talks, that's a figure of speech, that went over their head
Like the dough that I throw in the air like I'm Papa John
That mafia money, that parmesan
My shortie a dime, your bitch is a nine, pennies
Prolly take her to Dennys, we chillin' at Lenny's
You know I got 99 problems, but keep it a hundred
You know that I done it
Just me and my homies, we tryna make it to the summit
Praying that we don't plummet
Like "Oh my God look at your boy now you finally done it"
I've been writing these records from actual facts
So hopefully you learn something from it
But what I learned is

[Outro: Logic]
I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up
So high, so high
I said I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up
So high, so high
I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up
So high, so high
I said I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up
So high



[Chorus: Logic]
We are, we are, we are, we are
I’m just tryna live my life
I’m just tryna do what’s right
I’m just tryna gain insight
I’m not tryna sleep all through the day and get up at night
I’m tryna do it right
Can somebody show me the light?
I’m just tryna live my life
I’m just tryna do what’s right
I’m just tryna gain insight
I’m not tryna sleep all through the day and get up at night
I’m just tryna do it right
Can somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Can somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Can somebody
Let’s do this shit, that was lit
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
Yeah

[Verse: Logic & Juicy J]
Everybody know the real me
Something in your mind to feel free
So hot they all wanna kill me
Been forever but I’m still me
I’ma be real, I’m the man
I’ma be real I’m the rapper
I’ma be real I’m that mothafucka makin' millions
Now I ain’t no trapper
All of this shit is a facade
All of this shit is a fallacy
I ain’t me, I’m who you want me to be
Uh, fuck that
Grip the 45 and buck back
I been chillin' on the tuck back, I been chillin' on the tuck
Uh, yeah
Yup, I been way back in the cut
Homie, I don’t give a fuck
I’ma keep rapping about all of this shit that don’t matter and makin' a buck
I’ma keep, I’ma keep, uh
I’ma keep rapping about all of this shit that don’t matter and makin' a buck, listen up
I’ma keep rapping about all of this shit that don’t matter and makin' a buck
Like wassup

[Outro: Logic & Juicy J]
A'ight, let’s do this shit
(Shut the fuck up)
Let’s get this mothafuckin' money, man
We ain’t stuntin' these little stupid ass bitches
Stupid, fake ass niggas out here man
You know what I’m sayin'?
Getting extorted and shit
You know what I’m sayin'?
Fuck y’all niggas, man
Perpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man
All on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
And tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob
That’s crazy!
Yo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album
Oh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, "Aw fuck"



[Hook]
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go
(Hey!) Are you ready to go? Ready to go
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go

[Verse 1: Logic]
On my Charlie Sheen, homie, yes I am a winner
And when it comes to making music, I am no beginner
Hit the stage and get wild, my braniac's loud
Call me 007 because I bond with the crowd
You shine like a star but I sun it
50 keep it a 100, homie you know I run it
The game needs change and Logic can break a 100
I had a shorty to bun it, until she didn't want it
So I focused on the flow and they gon' put me on the map
With a pocket full of change, every day a different dime
Only fuck with golden girls and I ain't talking Lifetime
When I rhyme they up on me cause they seen how I'mma shine
Now you may be wondering how my raps rock
Cause I'm so fifth key to the right of Caps Lock
And when my tracks drop I'mma be sipping Ciroc
With a whole skyline chilling in the backdrop

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Phil Ade]
Shit, nigga I was born ready
And I swear I'm what these rappers can’t bear, warn teddy
My Pro Tools bouncing like a '64 Chevy
I'm trying to win fast y'all on that Eddie
Plus Carl and Harriet, G is how I carry it
Been in it for miles, don't believe ask Darius
Running this beach like Chariots of Fire
I aspire to be higher than these superficial liars
The attire I acquire cost a grip, buy your pliers
I'm a ball out and die in Maryland, Len Bias
Apply a sire to my name, yeah you ain't know I'm royal
I foil from slick talk, yeah trip of that oil
Toying with girls feelings, lord forgive me I need healing
I know you said it's wrong but a long would make a killing
Hit the bong I hit the ceiling, hit the drink I hit the floor
If they show 'em in the buildin to the crowd then let me know

[Hook]

[Repeat Intro]



[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, I'm living abroad like the baddest bitch you've ever seen
Ain't about that hybrid shit but I'm all about the green
Making so many moves I need a dose of Dramamine
For rap I'm a fiend, come and test my team
I school MC's cause I'm the motherfucking dean
My cerebral cortex force, my trigger finger reflex
To bust Tecs like raw sex, ain't no tellin' what's next
I sling mixtapes like crack rocks
Watch snow bunnies chillin' in the backdrop, discussin' how the track rocks
Goddamn, I'm a miraculous man
And if I wasn't Logic, I'd be his number one fan
Beware I'm spittin' fire cause the world is in dire need of an MC to admire
And set the bar higher
So I conspire, within my mind just had a friar
The rap Messiah, fresh to death so peep the attire
Feelin' like B Rabbit when he slaughtered the Lotto
Get money, fuck bitches, and respect women is the motto
You say potato, I say potato
You call 'em rappers but all I see is comedians
My future's lookin' XXL, they shit is medium
Call me Bobby Kennedy the way I fuck with Marilyn
MCs approach, take notes, and then I bury them
I'm out of this world, my studio's the planetarium
The way I flow, this shit is slicker than butter
The second I utter lyricism that leave all the rest in the gutter
I thought I told ya'll I'm the best, d-d-did I stutter?
I'll hit your mom in the head with a car bomb just to blow her mind like Vietnam
Had a myspace account but my only friend was Tom
When I eat pussy I pretend that I'm speaking in Islam
Psych, It's a joke I swear that I'm not racist
To be honest I'll murder you no matter what color your face is
Punch you in the face if I catch you slippin' in braces
You want beef? I'll choke you to death with your own shoelaces
Psych, I swear I'm not a violent guy
Once upon time I brought a Super Soaker to a drive-by
Full of Kool-Aid and warm piss
My buzz is growing every day and when the swarm hits
Million dollar trips, sex at the Ritz
So rich I'll make bitches show Charlie Murphy their tits
Blow the competition to bits, leavin' the enemy lit
But I'm out cause there's women to please and money to get
It's Logic



[Intro: Charlie Chaplin (Sampled) & Samples]
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible: Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there’s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls...
"Sinatra" "Sinatra shot ya, goddamn you"
"Is this what you want?" "Logic"
"You are watching a master at work"
"You have interfered with our affairs for the last time"

[Verse: Logic]
Many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons
Fans telling me never change, but it's hard to fight the seasons
They hear me on the radio and now they yelling "Treason"
'Cause Logic givin' 'em mainstream verses like Ephesians
But I never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow
There's a time and place for everything, so what the fuck you yelling for?
The fame hit me quicker than previously determined
RattPack, real all the time, fuck a vermin
Motivated by money, sex, drugs and violence
'Cause the era that we living in was built up on defiance
What we need is alliance, but y'all don't really hear me though
So, hip-hop's a chariot and Logic's finna carry it
Stallion, coming for their necks like a medallion
Straight out of Sierra Leone
Motherfuckers it's on, I'm under your skin like cortisone
Ninty-nine percent of these motherfuckers is bullshit
But I'm on that Bull shit: Michael Jordan
Cutting records after the show in my hotel while I'm touring
Yeah, and I ain't even twenty-three
But my bank account can vouch, I'm ballin' like an M.V.P
Yes, it's me, L.O.G.I.C, I'm repping M.D
Now what the fuck is a vacation? I see no satisfaction
I work twelve hours a day every day with no distraction
Seven days a week, and twelve hours, that's a lazy day
Going seventy-four hours with no sleep, call that a crazy day
"As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours"
This is Manhunt, and I ain't stopping till y'all apprehended
Many years I have attended and finally been commended
For keeping it real, so finger fuck whoever I've offended
Now pull out the MAC and watch them freeze like PC's
I'm Celsius, never graduated, so fuck degrees
I educate 'em with ease, however listener please
Don't knock that last line, school it just wasn't for me
We all different and I'm here to make a killing
So say hello to the villain, 'cause in this day that we livin' in
The nice guys finish last
I'm blowing up, guess you could say I'm having a blast

[Outro: Samples]
"Sinatra shot ya, goddamn you"
"You are watching a master at work"
"Is this what you want?"



[Hook (Sampled)]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on

[Verse]
They lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, capisce?, hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood
Cause selling crack and busting gats don't make my raps good
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. repping MD to the fullest
Push us to the limit but never pull us now
I can't wait 'til I see my name in neon
That fly shit I be on flowing for eons
Every day I take chances, Celine Dion
Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion (let's get it)
I'm a diamond in a rough, but I shine like discos
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, Oh my God this go
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm original see but they trace like stencil
I stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

[Hook (Sampled)]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on

While you wait, please listen to a word from our sponsors...

[Skit: YaLocalWhiteBoy , Logic (Marty Randolph) & Logic (Female Voice)]
Y'know, it's crazy cause it's two types of motherfuckers
It's one motherfucker talking 'bout:
"Oh Logic's so slept on, he's so lowkey..."
Knowing damn well this motherfucker did 135K first week
First fucking week!
Then it's other motherfuckers talking 'bout:
"Oh, Logic's blowing up, he's getting so big now. I don't want him to blow up on me. Oh, Logic's changing..."
Cause he made a turnt ass mixtape!
We're going to be bumping this shit the whole summer!
The fuck?!
Current wait time is 36 minutes...
36 minutes? It was just a minu—it was just one minute!
What the fuck?!
And do y'all not listen to lyrics?
He's making a whole other concept album

This man dropped a project every year for six years
I mean, I'm not complaining though but—
Current wait time is 1 hour, 40 minutes...

Current wait time is...
Okay God, thank God!

You name it, he does it! The fuck?
WHAT FUCKING RAPPER DOES THAT?!
Current wait time is...

[Outro: Logic (Marty Randolph)]

[Intro]
Chattering

[Hook]
Feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I'm low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

[Refrain]
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

[Verse]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water now I'm prayin' for a flood
Feel like time passing me by, slower than a slug
While this feelin' inside of my body's seepin' like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you'll never leave
Even though my daddy you know he

[Outro]
Wait a minute, is that—?
Ayy, who's playin' that? You playin' that?
6ix you can't be playin' that, that's the album shit dawg!



[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is my vision
Written without second thought or revision
The type of shit that affect you like an oncoming collision
That just make you freeze, drop to your knees and beg 'em
Please Lord, forgive me for gripping a semi now
When searching for God all I ever do is stare up
While Satan sending me women
Wearing nothing but they hair up
Got the condom on the dresser, I can't wait to undress her
Would you think lesser of me if I did it?
Cause I get lonely, I'm human, and boy it's been a minute
Fresh out the states, surrounded by women that wanna hit it
But should I take the pussy just cause I could get it?
Or do I want something that's more committed?
God damn, it's hard to admit it
As you focus on the little things, the bigger ones will get you
So I minimize the negatives to see the bigger picture
I get richer while you fuckers hate
So keep it up and watch a young brother elevate
I'm black and white but racism I still cannot evade
I never understood the concept, even to this day
You know we're all the same in the eyes of a blade
Because when men shed blood it's still the same shade

[Hook]
That's why I'm just a man homie
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man
But I don't think they understand homie
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
Yeah, y'all think I'm more than just a man

[Verse 2]
I contemplate on the daily if I'll survive and strive
To be the greatest lyricist dead or alive, I gotta prevail
That's my word like excel
Went from a small town in West Deer Park to XXL
Now we shopping at Louis V, back in the day it was Ross
They calling me the savior, hope they don't give me the cross
Now that's the realest shit you ever heard
Never in the streets but I was closer than the curb
Do you feel me?—Whole world wanna kill me
Signed a deal but I'm still me—in five years will I still be?
Ever since I was a youngin this is all I've ever wanted
Always kept it real while they perpetrated and fronted
I was in the studio while they was gettin' blunted
Always have my doubts but deep down I knew I'd run it
Sportin' Armani like menage a trois that's double breasted
A lot of time I've invested and never once have I rested
Feeling nervous like when you getting tested
The game is over saturated, completely infested
The greatest story ever told, realest song ever written
To hell with a Plan B, motherfucker I ain't kiddin
I''m just trying to get this money, I'm just trying to get paid
That's the type of mentality put careers in the grave
Fuck how much you made
What's it worth if your memory fade?
Now I ain't perfect, on occasion I'm strayed
It's been forever since I prayed and I guess today is the day
So I step in the booth and treat that shit like a confessional
Thinking back as I reminisce
Wondering; does God even exist?
A man of faith but mentally I feel at risk
What you want from me, where am I supposed to go?
Seems like you never talk, tell me how I'm supposed to know?
I'm just a man, I ain't perfect—is this life even worth it?
It's time to dig up the past so fuck it let's unearth it
Like my childhood, living free like a child should
Remember the time I opened the bedroom door crack?
And saw my daddy smoking more crack?
No food in my house, we just couldn't afford that
Momma drinking, sleeping until five
But she always seemed to get up whenever men arrived
Feeling alone at like eleven
Segregated from the other kids like it was 1957
I've loved, I've hated, I've cried, I've died inside
I've resurrected but don't neglect that I've modified
I'm stronger, faster, better than ever before
And everything I've been through can honestly assure
I'm no less, no more

[Hook]



[Intro:]
Yeah, my name is Riley, son
But you know what niggas call me?
AKA, Riley Escobar, know what I'm saying?
Cause I be in the streets you know?
I got all kinds of names like HR Paper Stacks
Uh, also known as AKA Horse Choker, uh

[Verse 1: Logic]
Hey, yo, I'll chop you up in sixteen pieces
In front of your nieces, while I'm eating Reese's
And won't even offer them any, yes I spit plenty
This is East Coast flow at its finest
In the studio, where you find us, put a bullet where your spine is
At sixteen I was skipping school and smoking chronic
While you was learning about English, Big L was teaching Ebonics
I spit fire so demonic, writing code like I'm masonic
A Jedi master breaking it down like old plaster
No medication for this track cause this is how a psycho rips
My bank account is like casino vaults, your pockets microchips, uh
Motherfucker, I dare you to test it, hope you're well rested
Whoop your ass and get arrested, in a double breasted
Louis Vuitton diamond encrested tailor made suit
Now that's All Sinatra Everything
I explode like hollow tips on contact
Chronologically murder schmoe there's no bringing Joe back
Puffing cubans and sipping Cognac
Mafietic mentality, introduce me to this beat and it's fatality
I kill mics like Conrad Murray
Sharp like Hanzo steel, the rest is obtuse
I get loose when sipping Goose and rhyme like Doc Seuss
Flow tight like noose, whoop ass like Bruce, no time for a truce
Alphabetical mathematic addict
I spit sixteens so erratic you think it was a semi-automatic
I know by now you thinking "Oh my God, he let them have it"
But that was just a loan, time to collect like I'm Capone
Reap what I've sewn, in other words that is the throne
Chilling while homies smoking marijuan'
If you thinking that this shit is wack well then you're dead wrong
Cause for every emotion and every mood I have a song
For the club, for the streets, for the whip and for the sheets
Cause this is where intellect and versatility meets
I'm Young Sinatra, backstage chilling with BobbySoxers
I got ya

[Outro:]
Yeah!
You wanna fuck with us?!
Fuck with us, yeah!?



[Intro]
I did it today, I made myself say
And I take back my tears, my sight, my love
No more does your magic work, on my heart
No more will your words ever tear me apart
I know now for certain, nothing's burning anymore
And I came strolling alone
Like your perfect girl in your perfect song
You'll forget who fixed you, in a little while
I know for certain, there's nothing burning anymore
I know now forever, nothing's burning anymore

[Skit: Tom Hansen in [500] Days of Summer]
"I love her smile, I love her hair, I love her teeth. I love this heart-shaped birthmark she has on her neck. I love the way she sometimes, licks her lips before she talks. I love the sound of her laugh."

[Verse 1]
I can feel it now, it's coming soon
It is my world, my sun and moon
Once upon a time, this world was love
But now I know this is everything that I've dreamed of
So take it slow, speed it up
Every time I see you I just want to beat it up
Maybe not, but that's a lie
C'mon baby girl, there ain't no need to cry
Just let me go or let me know
Why the hell you wanna stick around fo'
Arms length, that's all you do
Don't get too close, that is the rule
I remember when I met her back in high school
Science class, sitting on the stool
Now I'm feeling—feeling like a fool
Cause I cut that tie months ago, this girl is cruel
Or maybe not, just very lovely
No matter what she says I know she still loves me
So can I love?—I've already asked
Who would've known matters of the heart
Would be such a task?

[Skit: Tom Hansen in [500] Days of Summer]
"I hate summer, I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. And I hate the way she sounds when she laughs."

[Verse 2]
She used to be my girl
But now she just a girl I'm fucking
She used to mean the world to me
But now that world is nothing
I would've put a ring on that finger but I couldn't afford it
So I laced it with ribbon, she adored it
Sometimes I wonder if she thinks of me
But my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively
How could the pussy be that good?
Cause my feelings involved
'Til my shorty evolved and her feelings dissolved
But that's what happens when you find them young
Treat them like royalty, and they will run
Searching the world for perfect love and realize you're the one
But they fucked up cause now that shit is done
This is a letter to the woman of my dreams
Love what she brings
So listen baby girl cause everything ain't what it seems
You either know me now or I'mma meet you after fame
But one thing's for sure, your life will never be the same
Cause you're gonna be my wife and my mistress
So understand now I can't be there for every Christmas
I love you more than anything, but I could never risk this
On stage living life, while you're forced to miss this



[Refrain]
Visualizing the realism of life and actuality
Visualizing the realism of life and actuality

[Verse 1]
Various women, I'm swimming in, like a shark
Tear the pussy apart, shawty it's on after dark
Step to the mic and now I got ya, call me Young Sinatra
The flow is prominent, hella dominant, on time with it
When im rhyming it, several labels itching to sign with it
Let's check the women I'm bringing in with these ill synonyms
Softly killing 'em, in other words; I'm Lauryn Hillin 'em
I swear to god if I could I'd never turn the page
Living the rest of my days on stage
Fucking with bitches that never age
I'm so fly that I defy the laws of physics
I ain't think it was possible for a check to have this many digits
Mathematically exquisite, am I cocky—just a smidget
If you want beef then we can supersize
Freshman in the game
So they wanna haze me like my name Isaac
I killed the beat and dig a ditch just to fossilize
To make sure none of you bammers try to reprise it what

[Hook]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some

[Verse 2]
I'm working a nine to five just to survive, barely staying alive
Hard to stay focused without the drive
See I bus tables and my homie Castro is a waiter
I can't wait to blow and say "I told you so haters!"
Living the life of a egotistical pistol gripper
Isn't a life for me, I'd rather grip mics and undo girls zippers
But not them ho girls, meet me after the show girls, but take it slow girls, have 'em coming back for mo' girls

[Refrain]
Visualizing the realism of life and actuality
Visualizing the realism of life and actuality

[Verse 3]
Various managers coming up talking bout they got me
But really they shady and they slim in a pair of Versaces
I know you see me shining, and practicing and grinding
While they conform to the norm you'll catch me designing
A different type of sound
While you was stuck inside the box, I had already been around
Inner peace and happiness I'm always tryna' find it
And I kinda got the feeling that a woman is behind it
So I'm always chasing tails the real life sonic
And I'm always spitting fire half black, half demonic
Nah, I'm half black and half white
C'mon this sound it had to come from somewhere, right?
Nah, nah, see homie race is not the issue
And if you stepping to me like it is I'll dismiss you
The second you listen, the second I got you
I swear to god I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

[Hook]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some



[Verse 1: Logic]
Will I make it I don't know
From the bottom of my heart I swear to God I gotta blow
This for every time the world told me no
If I don't make it in this game I ain't got nowhere else to go
From the drama to the hoes
From the records to the shows
I gotta make it, and if they don't give me what I deserve
Then Imma take it, I've been underrated, underestimated and hated
But I can't wait to look back and say that I made it
Cause nowadays everyone's a rapper and I hate it

[Hook 1: Logic]
Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh
Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Logic]
I had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears
While you was out partying, chilling and sipping on some beers
I was sacrificing adolescent years
Blood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is
And now I'm feeling, I'm feeling like the moment has arrived
With Bobby is no longer living and Logic has revived
From his ashes, music, money, liquor, I'm fucking passed this
Lyricism that's driven from a master you bastards

[Hook 2: Queen Latifah (Logic)]
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)

[Verse 3: Logic]
All I ever wanted was some financial security
And now I fuck with bitches just to mask my insecurities
Cause pussy ain't nothing, but my heart is sure full of something
Now I'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather
High score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level
Mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner
Visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner
Noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner

[Hook 1: Logic]
Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh
Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

[Hook 2: Queen Latifah (Logic)]
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)

[Verse 4: Logic]
You know my steelo, busting shots like free throws
The young bandito, cutting records like they was kilos (ha)
Is it a blessing that I'm messing with girls
That wanna undress in the back of my car
Or is it just cause I'm a star? Or is it just cause I'm a star?
5 foot 7, looked like she fell from heaven
With an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend
She was black and asian, part Hispanic and part amazing
Women they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest
My heart only has one love like Serena and Venus
You know I am the meanest genius with the biggest-HEY!
See baby girl I know you got some problems
Just know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em
I swear I take care of all em' but you gotta trust it
Love it, open your heart before you lust it
Now bust it, what

[Hook 2: Queen Latifah (Logic)]
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day living in the hood
Just a—Just another—Just another—Just another day
Lovely (I feel lovely) Sunny Norway
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)



Atom: So, we waiting for what?
God: Excuse me?
Atom: So you sittin here telling me, this place is a waiting room, right? What are we waiting for?
God: Rebirth
Atom: Rebirth? Like reincarnation?
God: If that's what you wanna call it
Atom: What the fuck you mean, “If that's what I wanna call it?” Either this is what it is, or this is what it ain't
God: Sure
Atom: Chu mean? Ugh, this mothafucka
Atom: A'ight, lemme get this straight: every time I die, I come here, we talk, and you send me back to earth to be reborn?
God: You know the last time we had this conversation it was in mandarin and you were 13
Atom: Mandarin?
God: And a girl
Atom: What? Nah, bruh, you fuckin' wit' me. Like, Jesus Christ
God: He was here too
Atom: What? Wait, wait, so the Christians got it right?
God: Well I’m about to reincarnate you, Atom. I’d say everyone kinda got it right
Atom: This is a whole lot to take in
God: I know. Trust me, I’ve been there
Atom: So, how many times have I been reincarnated?
God: Many, many, many, many, many times
Atom: If it’s so many times, why don’t I remember?
God: If we stayed here long enough, the lives you have lived, and the knowledge from each of them would return
Atom: What?
God: I’m actually about to send you back to 1736 as Bryan Fairfax, the 8th lord Fairfax of Cameron
Atom: Word, ayy, that sounds important
God: Oh, yes. You own 40,000 acres
Atom: Goddamn! Oh, I’m sorry
God: Ha, it's quite alright
Atom: Well, at least I’m not poor no more
God: Well, sure. With all that land and the hundreds of slaves you’ll own
Atom: Slaves?! Aw, hell nah! No, no, no, no, look, look, look: how you gonna take a black man, send him back in time, and now I gotta own slaves?
God: Well, if it's any consolation, your son Tom, the 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, sets them free
Atom: No! That does not make me feel better at all. Wait, hold up, I just realized you said you’re gonna send me back in time?
God: Well, I’m not really sending you back in time. That doesn’t exist where I come from, only in your universe
Atom: Well, where are you from?
God: Honestly, Atom, even if I explained where I came from, or told you about the others like me, you just wouldn’t understand
Atom: But if there's others like you, how can you be god?
God: Atom, I said you wouldn’t understand
Atom: So what's the point of doing all this?
God: Really?
Atom: What?
God: A little cliche, don’t you think? Essentially asking me the meaning of life
Atom: Well, I figured I would ask before you send me back and I can’t remember none of this
God: Atom, come here. The meaning of life, the reason I created this place, is so that you can grow and mature
Atom: Like the human race? Like this is how the human race is supposed to grow and mature? Mature into what? We can’t even get along
God: No, Atom, you! It’s for you, you to mature
Atom: I don't understand
God: I created this place for you, Atom. This entire place was made for you. Every time I send you back, every life you live, you grow and mature and understand the grand meaning behind all of this just a little more each time
Atom: Just me? Wait, what about everybody else?
God: Atom, there is no one else
Atom: I don't understand
God: Atom, you are every human being who has ever existed since the dawn of your kind on earth
Atom: Wait, I'm everyone?!
God: Ah yes, now you are beginning to see it
Atom: So I’m like, everyone that ever existed on Earth, ever?
God: Earth? Ha, that’s cute. Earth was just your birthplace. Let us not forget all the stars humanity will colonize over the millennia
Atom: Wait, that is so much. Too much to take in. I’m every human being that ever lived?
God: Or ever will live, yes
Atom: I’m Jesus?
God: And all of his disciples
Atom: I’m Hitler?
God: And the millions he murdered
Atom: That's deep
God: You see Atom, every act of hatred and violence you committed against another, you were committing against yourself and every act of love and hand of kindness, you also extended unto yourself
Atom: God, why do all this?
God: Someday, long from now, you will become like me. You will mature to become what I am
Atom: I’m a god?
God: No, not yet. You see, I was once where you stand right now. It is not until you have lived every human life inside of your universe that I may take you from this place. Once you have walked in the shoes of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, loving and hateful person, it is only then that you will understand how precious life truly is



[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah, bitches be pressed for paper
Chillin' with my homie SlayDro while he ignites the vapor
Life is a bitch and you cannot escape her
Unless you talking suicide
What the fuck you mean that I'm changin'?
'Cause I finally gotta little bit of money and a range in
My drive way with a Rattpack smoking on Zimbabwe
Crankin' Sinatra, that "My Way"
Bitches they love it, Visionary nothin' above it
Get shorties wet when I rub it, carbon copies they dub it

[Chorus: Logic]
You used to hate it, now you love it
Smile in my face? I think nothin' of it
Yeah, I shake your hand, kill em' with kindness
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest
You used to hate it, now you love it
Smile in my face? I think nothin' of it
Yeah, I shake your hand, kill em' with kindness
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah
This is for my independent women that is runnin' shit in high heels
Educated in business but majored in sex appeal
My shorty she gotta, sportin' gucci louis and Prada
Looking beautiful in it all but I prefer nada
Yeah, low maintenance and high scale
Type of shorty that when you get locked up she pay the bail
I used to follow my dreams until I caught up to em'
People talking shit but pay attention to what we doin'
It's never been done, watch me go platinum just for fun
Far from materialistic, but let me stunt son
You know what I been on, you know where I be at
The proof is within the numbers, they slumber but now they react
I got three tapes, zero tolerance, one of the greats
Put that shit together and what you get that's where I'm from
The three-oh-one, smoking joints with your girl for fun
Stand strong and never run 'less the POPO go for the gun like

[Chorus: Logic]
You used to hate it, now you love it
Smile in my face? I think nothin' of it
Yeah, I shake your hand, kill em' with kindness
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest
You used to hate it, now you love it
Smile in my face? I think nothin' of it
Yeah, I shake your hand, kill em' with kindness
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

[Verse 3: Logic]
Yeah
We snatch it like interception
Met the girl of my dreams, her love resembled inception
Her sign was a leo, me, her, and music, that's the perfect trio
Spanish hunny we met in Rio, future lookin Cleo
Bitches be braggin', so much money my pants saggin'
VMG is up-to-date but these businessmen be laggin'
Eve bit the apple and Steve changed the world
Getting money like Zuckerberg, my bank account is sterol
I am not defined by that in which I do possess
'Cause all it takes is riches to get bitches to undress
I need drive in a lady, not a girl that drive me crazy
Need a girl that don't care if I drive a Honda or Mercedes
Spit fire like Hades, I infect it like rabies
It's all that, shout out to them '90s babies
Never hesitate to supply the heat
What 6ix produces from his chest, we call that shit a heartbeat
I'm a king, you fuckas my pawns
Shortcut to the desktop, I am your newest icon
These bitches they love it, I truly can't stress it enough
Girl, got them daddy problems that's why she be actin' tough
Innocent in person, but in the bed she love it rough
Running away from reality to sniff coke and puff
So, let me get it the second I spit it you know that I did it everybody wanna come around
They used to hate it, but now they love the sound

[Chorus: Logic]
You used to hate it, now you love it
Smile in my face? I think nothin' of it
Yeah, I shake your hand, kill em' with kindness
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest
You used to hate it, now you love it
Smile in my face? I think nothin' of it
Yeah, I shake your hand, kill em' with kindness
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest



"Hmmm, yeah!"
Sinatra

[Verse 1: Logic]
Aight, yeah, yeah, homie I'm comin'
I'm coming and I'm never gonna give up
My mentality is making rappers feel like
They can never even live up to Logic
You bust I dodge it
Think you seein' me, nah, you just miragin'
I'm gunnin, I'm gunnin like a semi-automatic
That's really equipped with lyricism, I'll let 'em have it
I blast it, any style that you comin' at me with
I master it, I slam mothafuckas that I'm out on you bastards

"Syke, I'm just playin' with y'all."

Yeah, you know I had to keep it going
Kid rhymes that blow minds and C4in
Real recognize real and you lookin' foreign
I was spittin' flows before I was even born in the womb
And I'ma keep it up until the tomb
And as for the fame, yeah I know it's coming soon
Cause I'm goin' in raw, finna bust up in your room
I hit a beat and it's ergence to emerge in the game
Pukin Hodukens I'm too sick to spit that Yoga flame
The way I see it, this is rap second renassaince
Spittin' dirty sentences, so ill they affecting medicine
Ha, I'm heaven sent and spittin' fire like a demon
As the internet I let my flow to get to streamin', I'm beamin'
Flawlessly listen in that women in yo head while you dreamin'
Leo Dicaprio flow all up in that bitch schemin'
Tryna' get you to buy that album, tryna get you feenin'
See my vision as I commentate it
You wanna see naked rerun of the bait but the hater ate it
Success is truly overrated
I've seen caster with a blow up to pop and get deflated
See yeah, you made it but all your fans hate it
And it's kinda lookin' like you and Satan negotiated
When it comes down to the rap game you see I'm intergrated
Half-white, half-black I had it incorporated
Get the money

"Whoever did this is a real pro."

Yeah, I'm just a youngin' with a dream
Who spittin' 'til sixteen
Quite the microphone fiend
Other rappers nah'mean
When I step up on the scene
All they gon' see is my skin
'Til I open up my mouth and they find out my lyrics mean
Had I meet up with Raheem
Dre and the whole team
But before I execute a perfect plan I gotta scheme
Cause right now I'm on the dolo
Everything about this tape I did it on the solo
Yeah, I said it's hurricane Logic
Maryland they can't dodge it
They gon' be bumpin' me from the burbs to the projects
I get on the mic and excite anybody around me
You're probably wondering why a label has not found me
It's not that easy, I gotta work from the ground
Be the center of attention, look at the people around me
Black on the inside, my outside Ritz
What's a cracker without a cheese
I gotta stack chips

"Would you care for a glass of grape juice?"
"Nigga, what the fuck is juice?"
"You have interfered with our affairs for the last time."



[Hook: Logic]
Trynna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Trynna get it like ...
Like me
Trynna get it like
Can't get it like

[Verse 1: Logic]
Chillin on the west side
Bringing out my best side
Where they only care 'bout bitches and how big their breast size is
Yes I is, on the come up daring all of y'all the run up cause you know I'm finna one up mutherfucker uh
Pull up in the benz while the homie smoking medical
Only bring ya friends if them bitches look identical
The pinnacle of what we doing ain't no where round
Started from the ground always gotta hold it down
Now they think they got it cause they signed up on the dotted
But there's only so much money in the year that is allotted
Plus you prolly don't even know how it is divided
Motherfucker I got it

[Hook: Logic]
Trynna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Trynna get it like ...
Like me
Trynna get it like
Can't get it like
Trynna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Trynna get it like ...
Like me
Trynna get it like
Can't get it like

[Verse 2: Logic]
Acting like they got it but they really don't (they really don't)
Bitches say they love me but they really don't (they really don't)
Shut the fuck up and get out my face ho (fuck out my face)
Talking all that shit but you don't really know
Put that pen to pad watch them talk about it
All I know is real life they don't give a fuck about it
Take your chain, your bitch, your car get the fuck up out it
Real is on the rise all of ya demise
This is who I am so ain't no need for a disguise
I have been advised by the greatest that made it, to do it
Living legends but you never knew it
This record was written right before I got on the stage
My mind racing reciting lyrics from pen to page
Bitch I bet I record this record on the red eye
Just because I said I was a Jedi, bust like Beretta
Now feel my penetration no hesitation this is warfare
Like guerilla, bananas clips can be iller
Fuck a filler this is the realist
The symphony I'mma kill this epiphany's I can feel this
But, you?

[Hook: Logic]
Trynna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Trynna get it like ...
Like me
Trynna get it like
Can't get it like

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Trynna get it like me
I'm a real young winner
Might take her out to dinner
Trynna hit it all night
I put that on me, baby girl gonna feel it
I know she about her business
If she want it then she know she about to get it
Throw some D's on that bitch
Pull up in that Audi coupe feeling like Hercules in the whip
Cause I'm dealing it, got it off the dealer ship
We be going hard no motherfucking censorship
Peas and Carrots squash hard to tell me what the deally is
She gonna roll with us like she need a ride to the crib (work)
She influence me to go hard, shout out to my niggas that's gonna go hard
We gonna get the profit player that just be the logic
Put my hands together prayed then I doze off

[Hook: Logic]
Trynna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Trynna get it like ...
Like me
Trynna get it like
Can't get it like



[Intro]
"I wrote a bunch of letters but—
I thought it made me look like a fool
So I never mailed any of them out"
I just wanna talk to you girl, mama you know are...I just got something I wanna say...

[Verse 1]
Baby do you remember
Warm summers and cold winters
Songs by soul singers the feeling it still lingers
Elevated by my kiss as you melted between my fingers
Babygirl, sometimes I wish
That I could just rewind this shit and take it back
I had visions but they just faded black
My train of thought is on a different track
When you’re in love it’s hard to separate fiction from fact
Your image in my head, and I’m trynna get rid of that
But you’re always on my mind like a fitted hat
Baby girl, I wanna bring it back to puppy love
When you was sent from up above to care for me
Said that you’d always be there for me
And even though you’re gone, it’s like you never left
Cuz you always in my heart and still take away my breath

[Hook]
Can I love?
Babygirl, can I love?
I said mama can I love?
Yeah, can I love?

[Verse 2]
I wanna laugh with you
Run the water and take a bath with you
Stay up late and watch romantic comedies
When it comes down to it you’re my hearts commodity
Yea, and now I’m feeling like a fool
Writing love letters that you’ll probably never get
And right now, I love you more than I’d like to admit
Because we’re separated
Onto you this song is dedicated
I’m love sick and I need you to medicate it
Feeling devastated
I think about the past and now I hate it
Cause all it proves is that we never made it
See me and shorty got history like a textbook
But lately our positon is changed like that sex book
Ms. Independent she the type to hold her own
Late night contemplating all alone
The kingdom is empty without the queen upon the throne

[Hook]
Can I love?
Babygirl, can I love?
I said, Mama, can I love?"
I'mma ask you, can I love?"

[Verse 3]
They say there’s many more in the sea
But rather then go fish I play solitare
I look around and see you everywhere
But at the same you’re never there
Fingers through your hair
Reminiscing bout when and where
Remember when we pulled up to that spot and did it there
See I hate to watch you walk away
But I love to watch you come
Baby girl you’re so lustful then innocent when it’s done
The love we share is like a fine wine
Cuz no matter what happens, it only gets better with time
Baby girl you’re so fine that I had to take the time
To articulate this rhyme with you in mind, you’re so divine
Ain’t no matter who you’re fucking with
Or no matter who I’m fucking with, you’ll still be mine
Will we make it? I don’t know
The only thing that will tell us is time

[Hook]
Can I love?
Babygirl, can I love?
I said, Mama, can I love?"
I'mma ask you, can I love?"



[Intro]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...

[Hook x2]
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine


[Verse 1: Logic]
Boy I know my shit was on another level
When people would joke around and say I signed with the devil
Cause it's gotta be a sin to be this good
Hating on my music shit I wish you would (i wish you would)
Yeah I been offered four of five deals
Bust like banana clips boy that's four or five kills
Doing the most accumulating so much bread
I think it's time for toast and I ain't talking fine wine
I'm talking semi-automatic shit that blow your mind
Then when I blow like mine the whole world gon' see me shine
This is the life that I should live homie
I'm never going back, I'm addicted to the game
Y'all can tell by the tracks

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough


[Verse 2: Logic]
I'm addicted to the game, addicted to the pain
Of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
Living a life that most won't attain
And I know it is essential
But when it comes to love, man, that shit is subsequential
For now I just be chillin' with ballers
Poppin collars, pushing Impalas, cutting records and counting dollars
I'm addicted, my lines is cocaine
And when they disperse blow minds like propane
And you know these haters that never made it this mad
Cause they never had what we had
Addicted to the game and I'm glad
On my Amy Whinehouse I'm saying fuck Rehab

[Hook]

[Outro]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...



[Intro: Samples]
"Young Sinatra" "It's like this, man, niggas, man
Niggas know not to fuck around with this shit though
I don't give a fuck how nasty niggas get" "Nah son
Let me tell these niggas something, God
I don't want niggas sounding like me... on no album
Keep it real, get your own shit, man, and be original
"Word up" "That's all, man" "Be a better man"
"And you gon', you gon' come out on your own way
Whatever how you gon' take it, man, fuck it" "Rat Pack niggas"

[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, I force MC's to bleed, retreat and recede
That's the Young Sinatra creed, killin' a track with incredible speed
And doin' it like it's nothin', no bluffin', gotta kill it everyday though
Slice MC's like Kato, gotchya head spinnin' like dreidel
Assassinate 'em so fatal, grip the heat and then tell ya to freeze
Gettin' cheddar at negative thirty degrees
I'm talkin' mula, money, euro, dollars, that yen
Blow it, let's spend it again, I'm livin' the life until the end
Can't comprehend what I got goin', never knowin' when Logic flowin'
'Cause I'm creepin', like ether the way that I seep in
Swimmin' in women like the deep end
Chillin' with shorties that smoke reefer and blow like Aretha, uh
Now, Sinatra said the best revenge is massive success
I guess that's women and multiple digits in excess
Ya family broke bread, but my family's bread was soggy
Till my brother's broke bricks like Mr. Miyagi
Now what the fuck…

[Chorus: Samples (Logic)]
"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "You are watching a master at work"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think—" (Yeah, uh, yeah) "Logic" (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Logic]
All of a sudden I feel the inner killer emergin'
Never splurgin', bingin' money and never purgin'
Urgin' women to fuck on the rug 'cause it's imported Persian
Then bypass matters of the heart like a surgeon
Now, it's hard to ball when there's problems within the inner circle
One moment they cool as Stephan then flip it like Urkel
Or flip it like keys, yeah, they flip it like ki's
From drug lords overseas that export it with ease
Bitch please, we stack cheese so old it's mold
I'm 'bout that money, so excuse me if my heart is cold
The magnum deployed, then I destroy mattresses
Late night love affairs with New York City actresses ("Rat Pack niggas")
I broke in the game and destroyed the first couple stages
Visionary takin' over regardless of our ages
Makin' history today to solidify in the pages of tomorrow
The industry is fucked, nothin' but sorrow, but I'm
Playin' for keeps in other words no need to borrow
So you can keep your advances, wack hooks, and pop dances
Don't get me wrong, I'm all about the mainstream
As long as I sign the deal I want and have the same team
And now they trippin' like a flight to Vegas
Tellin' me that I'll never make it and this shit is outrageous
Now what the fuck...

[Chorus: Samples (Logic)]
"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "You are watching a master at work"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think—" (Yeah)
(Motherfucker) "Logic"

[Verse 3: Logic]
Therefore you're never mourn like a memory repressed
MC's digest quicker than bullets shot from a gat with the barrel suppressed
One to the dome, two to the chest
If by chance they got a vest, however nevertheless
I'm lookin' for that real deal, shit that make me feel
Pleasure and pain, ain't no way to measure the game
I got haters in fifty-seven languages, watch me vanquish this
The come up, bust quicker than .357 caliber
Sharp as Excalibur, crushin' muthafuckas like Galaga now
Time is money, something you can never recoup
So stop wastin' mine, hit rewind and then fuckin' regroup
Never messed with them chicken heads, but catch me in the coupé ("Rat Pack niggas")
Never in public 'cause I'm a studio fiend
Rockin' diamonds and gettin' money, we call that ice cream
Now, allow me to give you the scoop, shit, I'll make it a double
I came up around more rocks than Barney Rubble
Murderers and drug dealers, I knew it no rebuttal
Ain't no need to claim it, picked up the heat, but never aimed it
Now Jay gave us The Blueprint, I lay the foundation
Tell ya what I'm facin', bars like incarceration
'Cause my mind is always racin', ain't no time for vacations
I'm never pacin', unless I'm on the phone talkin' business
Get wit' this, best witness like Christmas, I'm fuckin' rappin'
Walk in the spot and all these haters go for the dap and
I never carried 'em, kill 'em with kindness then bury 'em, yeah
I was born with talent, God gave me the gift
And now I pull more strings than guitar riffs
What the fuck…

[Chorus: Samples (Logic)]
"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "You are watching a master at work"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think—"
(Now that's all Sinatra everything)



[Intro: Frank Sinatra]
I would like to be remembered as a man who brought an innovation to popular singing
I would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living his life and who had good friends, a fine family

[Hook]
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on

[Verse 1]
Yeah, me and my team used to dream about
The future but now we be rollin' everywhere we goin'
Our cards never showin' the moment I'm flowin' we livin' it right now
Long way from the ghetto
Pull strings like Gepetto poppin' that fine wine
Look at the way my chain shine
Soon as I change my state of mind, from a lazy ass boy
To a man that's on his grind so answer my question
Did I even mention the fact that I'm livin' the life that I wanted
I keep a hunnid, got cash in abundance, that's bills by the hunnid
I've said it and done it, you know that I run it while everyone else
Say it, then plummit now, yeah you know I run it now
While the whole world wonder how
My chain shine nice
But I am not defined by the money, not defined by the ice
What defines me, let me tell you what defines me
Is the heart and the effort I give in e-every letter in which I write for you
And if you ignorant closed minded motherfuckers do not like it
It's not right for you
No it's not right for you

[Hook]
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm swimming in women like Young Sinatra 1 & 2
With the RattPack on my back there's really no telling what we finna do
If a shorty in my eye, then yes baby girl I be coming for you
Nice cars, nice clothes, hotel suites after the shows
So simplistic, never materialistic, but we do like complements
Why? 'Cause theses diamonds are accomplishments
Food stamps, welfare, medicare and section 8 to
Louis V, smoking tree, and steak up on my dinner plate
And you wonder why us rappers floss, cause for once
We can finally afford the cost
I once was the worker now I'm the boss
See my chain is an accomplishment
I call these diamonds milestones
It's hard to call for help with no dial tone
But, now I'm buying whips with no motherfucking miles on 'em
But I don't blow my money, I give it back to people
Why these rappers spend money on blow and stop acting equal?
But I've been real since the fucking prequel
So the next time you that you looking at my chain
What you really see is 23 long years of pain
With nothing to lose and everything to gain
Cause the world is divided, but we are the same
And I'm getting that money, 'cause bitches they love me
And this is the life that I live, ain't it funny
But Imma keep rising, til ya'll realizing, that so much is waiting over the horizon
'Cause I've seen the day and yes also the night
So that means I've seen the darkness as well as the light
And that's the very same light
That's the very same light, that let my chain shine bright
Said that's the very same light, that let my chain shine bright
So...

[Hook]
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mayne?
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on

[Outro]
Logic
Open your eyes
Sinatra
And I don't think i could ask for anything more



[Hook: Logic]
Every time I think I gotta go, uh
Cause if you seek then you gotta know,uh
Bitches they only care 'bout the flow, uh
Come on you know how the story go, uh

[Verse 1: Logic]
This the shit that never runnin' they always pretendin'
I get condescending, ain't my word I'm bending
Just imagine like Lennon
That we livin' like long division, my vision is risen
Shout out my homie in prison, shit is deeper than an incision
On a lower level word to the devil
I could feel the trouble inside
Tellin' me what to do, I never abide
Feel the vibe
The second we arrive, you know we know just how to do it
My style they can never renew it, I bet they know it !!

[Hook x2: Logic]

[Verse 2: King Chip]
She came with a couple of friends told them come on in
I was wonderin', do you need someone to fill you in ?
On the reg nigga not givin' a fuck 'bout why you mad at me
I'm hittin' that pussy standin' up on the wall like ain't no gravity
King Chip is what ? good observation
He gon' keep living while you keep observating
Is that even a word ? Nah but is you hatin'?
Language is the art so when I talk I'm creatin'
A whole new way to live, way to think, way to feel
Let them bitch ass niggas know they fuck with me they gon get killed
They gon' run, put that on my son, nigga don't give no fuck
All a nigga know is bad luck, bad luck
Knowin a nigga gettin' to these L's while I can doe
Working towards more happiness than I can handle
Light the candle, South Africa after sexin'
My doors open we smoking, chilling, relaxin'

[Hook x2: Logic]

[Verse 3: Logic]
I see through these motherfuckers like cat scans
And if they talkin' back I just give them the backhand
Think I work for Apple the way I give 'em the Mac man
Only partially ballin' motherfuckers is Pac-Man (God Damn!)
I'm just playin', dont pay attention to what I' sayin'
Everything just a part of my plan
Cause really I ain't shit I'm just a man
Chilling in my city spending money like Diddy
Hundreds and fifty's I'm spittin' greedy
While you sittin' pretty, who fuckin with me?
First name Bobby, but I spit that crack like I was Whitney
Started as a hobby but who knew back then what this shit would get me ?
And now they all up on the scrotum
The second I told 'em these lyrics I wrote 'em
Acting like I owe'd em
Not a lot of people understand my words cause I encode'em
Now these bitches give me the top of the totem
Allow me to break it down, I feel like I'm breaking down
'Til I hit the mic cook up the shit that I'm making now
Kinda like Quentin Tarantino these only built for cuban links
With Gambino's at the casino blowin' my nose with a C-note
Some people call me Robert cause I'm all about the Dinero
You talk a lot of shit thats why you sound like a culero
You fuckin' perro my lyricism es fatal pendejo
All up in my business while I'm just tryna get the queso
Life is about the peso, in English that means the money
And if your buzz is as big as mine then you'll get all the honeys like

[Hook x2: Logic]



[Hook: Adele (Sampled)]
This is the end
Hold your breathe and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

[Verse: Logic]
Yeah, it's been a long time coming, and you know this all I got
I've been sacrificing for years while the rest of y'all have not
These motherfuckers want my spot, catch me slipping? I think not
So I'ma do this shit until the day my body rot
I said, I'ma give it my all, never slippin', I won't fall
Down to fight right to the death, you know I been ready to brawl
Swear to God, I seen it all, hold up, let me paint that picture
I was poor, you was richer, but I'm in the ring witchu
Hold up, wait, now let me hit you with some real shit
Open up your mind, maybe you'll find that you can feel this
I had nothing, came up with somethin' and I still got it
Motivated by the shit I seen, boy, it's so hypnotic
Yeah, look to my left and see my brother selling drugs
Uh, look to my right and see my sisters fucking thugs
Ain't it funny how this life go
One moment you're in the dark, but when that light glow
It's like you're seeing for the first time, as I penetrate your mind
Like a burst of ammunition that was shot out of a nine
I'm givin' everything I got, so, yeah, it better be my time
They said I'd never make it, that's the reason I still rhyme now

[Hook: Adele (Sampled)]
This is the end
Hold your breathe and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen



Goddamn, Goddamn conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin, hit up my jewel and watch'em freezes
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything but somehow eases
Better believe us and then it leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whippin' her ass, I kill him I kill him I motherfucking kill him
I said I really want to kill him but I can't
Cause if I do popo will claim I'm the villain but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it
Okay I'm gone, memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chilling sippin Sinatra from a flask, little Bobby
Just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble my homie in jail for robbing
Welfare, foodstamps and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Couldn't take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say?
I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen I'm from Maryland where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan for talking out of your corner
Catch me rolling with the realest, lyricism the illest
My chain is the chillest sub zero
Far from a hero bitch I'm DeNiro in Goodfellas
If you're doing your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me get it I spit it off the top ridiculus it's never like this
Can you feel it L-O-G-I-C I'm reppin M.D yes we on it Sway
How I gotta get it? All day, every day
Half white, half black goddamn I'm a mac
Can you feel it like that
Let me hit'em with the killer grunt
Always got a stunt then I get it with the sound effect
Never can neglect
Yeah I feel it yes I love it gotta get it
When I spit it up in N.Y.C the M.D is the realest, call me Logic
Yes you know the flow is so nostalgic at the 90's with this shit
That's off the top of the dome I'm reppin' V.M.G that's Visionary
And then IDJ that's Def Jam but you know we got the creative control
Hold up, let me bring it back and never slow it up we gotta do it goddamn homie we know
Shout out to the homie Gambino, get the C-Notes
This is how we do it can you feel it
It's so pathetoric, chillin' with my Indian homie Rhêtorík
A native American, this is how we do it come and stare again
Oh my god yes I can feel it goddamn
Hit you with the K chilling with my homie Slay
And these beautiful women I'm never swimming
I gotta ride with that, ride with her
One  hitta quitta never that
Once again, half white and half black
Reppin' M.D that's Maryland where I'm from I'm from the Burg, call it G
This is how we do it See, reppin' Gaithersburg Highschool
Never graduated but I'm not a fool
Feeling hella cool, feeling hella Breezy
This is how we do it can you geezy
I'm not even making sense so that's how you know it's off the top
Never drop, never got to stop I could get it
I could get it I flip it keep it going
Never knowing which direction I'm flowing
Goddamn yes I'm soarin' like I got it on the track
Matter fact bring it back, goddamn
Got it like that
Yes I love it, yes I does it yes I do it for the children like that
Wu-Tang, kill it bang, hit'em with the killa bee
Killer free, this is how we do it off the T.O.P it's me
The L-O-G-I-C I kick'em with the free it's Logic



[Frank Sinatra]
When I was 21
It was a very good year
It was a very good year
For city girls
Who lived up the stairs
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was 21

[Verse]
It was all a dream just a year ago
Bussin' tables and servin' food but y'all don't hear it though
Now I'm on another level but y'all aren't near it though
My soul bleedin' on the track, so spiritual
It's a blessing cause now rappin' is my profession yo
Set to detonate, I'm just waitin' for my time to blow
White boy at first glance but when I rhyme they know
Race don't mean a fucking thing the second that I flow
It's been a year and everything I said would happened has
While everybody that I know is out havin' a blast
I was right here in the studio bustin' my ass
It's been a year, I'm 21 but I feel (35)
And now I got this
I taste the blood, no one can stop this
Second I drop this, die hard fans is finna cop this
While the rest of the world follows through fiber optics
I took my time, see I studied the game, learned how to rhyme
I was around drugs and gats, but never delved in crime
Had other things in mind, so I began to grind
First tape was a success
Locally, I got press
But I knew this one right here would run the world a mess, but I digress
A year ago, I was a youngin in his room
Staring out the window, lookin' at the moon, knowing it's coming soon
But today I board this rocket ship and sonic boom
Cause I am no longer a seed, homie, it's time to bloom



Nunca creí que esto iba pasar. Eres lo mejor que me ha pasado. Te quiero tanto

[Hook]
Take some time, do it slow, tell me what you want
It's about that time, girl you know it, tell me what you want
I know you are my girl, tell me what you want
Why act like you don't want it girl, tell me what you want

[Verse 1]
Baby girl when it comes to women I've been around the block a couple of times
But you're the only shorty that's running circles in my mind
And in this day and age that we live in, and it's all defined
Why you so intellectual? Why you so damn fine, now
Hey girl, hey girl yeah I'm trying to get it
Stop with all these games and tell me whattup with it
Just take my hand, I'll be your man
We surrounded by infidelity in this world that we live in
But I promise I'll never give in, that's a given
I'm living for you and none other
Just a brother trying to find a lover to cherish until he perish
With honeymoons on the stars and vacations in Paris
Don't be embarrassed if you get addicted to these kinda things
It's the finer things, fuck the haters and what the drama brings
It ain't nada, I supply the Prada and diamond rings just as long as your heart sings, so

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh yeah
And now we back at it, shorty pussy like a drug, and she got me cornered like a crack addict
Got my mind racing, eradict
Better yet it's erotic
You want it I got it
Look at what you started, way she work it when she on top I might as well applaud it
Lord have mercy I'm trying to get it
Rip it and split it, hell yeah you know I did it
Converse then lay you down like a verse, I'm trying to hit it
Baby I want it, always down to keep it a hunnit
With you my feet are never on the ground, no way I'mma plummet
Headed to the summit, so tell me are you really 'bout it
I never doubt it, you're the one that I need
Apart from you my emotions begin to recede
You are everything that I have wanted and all that I need
So shorty tell me how you feelin', worth feelin', looks killin'
I need it. I'm not tryna beat it and delete it
I'm trying to build, and let you know that everything we share is real

[Hook]



[Intro]
Wake up, you bitch-ass
Cracker-ass motherfucker

[Verse 1]
See all I ever wanted was a window to sit close to
And you don't understand but in the end you ain't supposed to
I'm talking first class, 30,000 feet under my ass
Living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash
Now I'm living a life that you and yours could only dream about
And just a couple years ago this shit I used to scheme about
Rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror
Until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer
See this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days
Fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days
Good God, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance
96' Kool-Aid and Sega Genesis

[Hook]
"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

I got em' saying

"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

[Verse 2]
So many people think that they know my whole situation
Conversations with people that handle public relations
Nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations
Slowly pacing until I kill like that boy Jason
It ain't nothing, never folding or bluffin'
Get money, fuck bitches but respect women cause we love em'
Kiss em', touch em' and rub em'
Fuck em' but never grub em'
Hit it fast but then I slow it down like Robitussin
Shorty giving me brain until concussion
The club run out of vodka the second we rush in
Never under estimate the power in which I'm bustin'
My lyricism got yo girl blushin'
Ain't even touch her and yet she gushin' (ha)
Award shows, chilling with all my bros
Three-piece Ralph Lauren and some Jordans, I suppose

[Hook]



[Scene III]

[KAI:]
Yeah, then the bitch said, “Use a condom.” And I said, “Baby, there’s like 10 people left in existence, fuck does it matter?”

[THOMAS:]
You didn’t say that...

[KAI:]
Man, yes I did!

[THOMAS:]
No, you didn’t...

[KAI:]
I’m a grown ass man, what? I’ma lie to you? I’ma lie?
Alright, maybe I just thought it—but damn, she was just so butt naked! I’d wrap her up with a trash bag just to get in it, you know what I’m saying?

[THALIA:]
Guys, we seem to be approaching another ship...

[THOMAS:]
What?

[KAI:]
Impossible!

[THOMAS:]
How far?

[THALIA:]
32 kilometers...

[THOMAS:]
Shit... HQ this is pilot Quentin Thomas, accompanied by my first man in charge of infantry William Kai of the Aquarius 3, come in, over...

[HEADQUARTERS:]
HQ here. What is it, Thomas?

[THOMAS:]
My program has just informed me and my partner of another ship that’s now 31 kilometers out...

[HEADQUARTERS:]
Did you just say another ship?

[KAI:]
Yeah, that's what he said!
Another fuckin' ship in the middle of space, man!!

[THALIA:]
I’ve gathered information from the ship’s motherboard...

[HEADQUARTERS:]
Engage the ship!

[KAI:]
What?!

[THOMAS:]
Copy!

[THALIA:]
I’m receiving audio embedded in the ship’s distress signal...

[KAI:]
Man—
Why white people always gotta go investigating shit, man?!

[THOMAS:]
Shut up Kai—Thalia, play that message!

[THALIA:]
You got it...

[SMITH:]
This is Captain Christopher Smith of the Aquarius 1—the year is 2093—time unknown. The entire crew is dead, and I fear these are my last hours. Whatever you do, do not come knocking—

[KAI:]
Aw, hell nah—we gotta get the fuck outta here man!!

[THOMAS:]
HQ, engagement is a no go!
Permission of the Aquarius 3 to push through to Paradise?

[HEADQUARTERS:]
Permission granted!

[KAI:]
Man, thank God!



[Intro (Sampled): Stewie Griffin, Brian Griffin & Girl]
"Logic taught me."
"So, uh... it's been twenty-four hours. Got my money?"
"Oh... uh, you know what, just give me 'til next Friday. I'll have it for you."
"Oh-oh, uh, that's funny. I could've sworn I said 'have it today'?"
"Yeah... I don't have it, sorry."
"Oh. Well alright then...
Yeah, that's what happens man!"

[Verse 1: Logic]
I'm Stewie Griffin
And this game is Brian
Beatin' the hell out of em'
Tryin', to get this money
Check the statistics
The chances of me blowin' up are far from realistic
Fuck it, I'll risk it
To have a chance at fame, I'd never miss it
I know I'm gonna be famous cause my friends and family insisted
(laughs)
Been on the low, concealing my shit just like a biscuit
But it's time to let off, set off, break this bread off
Bitches I'm comin' and I ain't finna pull out
All I do is get this money
Cut these records and cool out
My favorite night of the week to perform is Friday
But I kinda see it as Louis Vuitton day
Cause when I step up on the stage
I'm snatchin' mics like Kanye
Too swift to book me for the night
That's Andre
Three stacks, I do it big
Take no relax, I'm spittin' the facts
Catch me in the booth, droppin' tracks
Yeah they talkin' bout me
Yeah, I know they talkin' bout me
Yeah I know they talkin' bout me but
Never face to face, they evade it
By rappers I'm hated
Because I'm fly, while they just levitated
As the hating escalated
My flow, it just elevated
Bitches I made it

[Verse 2: Logic]
Young jedi, all I do is stack bread
I Said I Be in the crib bumpin' Red Hot Chili Peppers
This right here for all my city reppers
Fly talker, sky walker, get gritty reppers
Follow your dreams, this life ain't what it seems
They used to tell me I'd never make it
Now my flow streams
Across the world, spit lyrics, let them unfurl
Poetic rhetoric my girl
Got my mind playin' tricks on me
My eyes is closed, the ice is froze, I got it
Hip-hop was never dead, but it was fallin'
And I caught it
The way I process chips, you think my brain's robotic
Fuckin' with bitches overseas cos the pussy's exotic
I went from switchin' lanes in the rain
To switchin' planes with dames
Poppin' champagne, spittin' game, and gettin' brain

[Outro]

[Stewie Griffin]
"Don't bring that trash in here. This is my house!"



[Verse: Logic]
I am not a poet, I am just a designer of words
Architect of sentences the way I form and merge
Paragraphs together that force emcees to submerge
With an urge to break free of this biracial jail cell
Feast on my memories, please come and taste this
Papa was a black man, mama was a racist
Growing up she called me nigga, kids called me cracker
While the whites got whiter, and the blacks got blacker
I was hurting, doing everything I can
Perceived as a white boy with the soul of a black man
Goddamn, looking up to Malcolm X
Studying his speeches, underlining text
How can I be white devil if my parents had sex
'Cause I'm black and I'm white
And I'm proud of every word that I recite
I know my roots, I know my past
I know the issue of my race ain't gonna last
We all breathe the same air and bleed the same blood
And when we die, the same ditch gets dug

[Spoken (Sampled): Martin Luther King Jr.]
I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream... One day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."



[Intro]
Meanwhile, back at the rapcave!
Jumping Gee willickers rapman you're never gona believe it!
What seems to be the problem my raptastic companion?
I just found out theres a bunch of wack ass, no talent having, swear they can
Rap, 40-something, shoulda got a job, still living with their parents, so wack they
Couldn't even get the whole 15 minutes of fame, only got 2 minutes perpetrating bitch ass
Motherfuckers out there on the scene trying to make music!
Oh my god! (I know!)
Rapman will not stand for this! (Go Get 'Em!)
To the booth!

[Verse 1]
Now let me hop up in the rap mobile, get so much pussy in the back they should call it the cat-mobile
Everybody's worried about a deal, but I keep it real
Fucking around and I hit you in the crown with a inevitable sound that's spreading through your town
Hold up! Gee willickers rapman I don't think they comprehend or can begin to even understand
We don't fight crime, we fight whack rhymes, one song at a time, line after line
Hold up! Motherfucker I'm bout to roll up, pull out the hamma on a bamma leave em tore up (oh my god!)
Yea you talk, but can you walk, lets see you put the dough up (Cha-Ching!)
Rhymes I throw up, a little nasty bastard, people hating on a brother just cause I mastered the flow
Like Jedi, bet I, murder it before you heard of it, bitches I'm murking it
Go berzerk in the club while honeys twerkin it
Haters talking shit where they ain't no time for this, you know I'm bombing this, the flow is ominous
Second I'm rhyming this, sound like a dominous (Ching!)
All the people that was hatin' in the beginning, know that I'm winning, let me slip through your fingers
And now your spinning, you can check the Polaroid pictures cuz bitches I'm grinning I got it
Treat the game like a honey, I had to get inside it
Visionary of logic, is like two planets collided
Im a lyrical miracle, matter fact a paradox
On stage while my DJ scratching like chicken pox
Never put me in your box, if your shit eats tapes
I'm not biting, only quoting one of the greats, now
The radio got me feeling disgusted, punch you in the snotbox til your brain concussed it
Women they lust it, when they guts get busted, rip it up and thrust it im the best trust it

[Interlude]
OH MY GOD! Rapman What have you done!?!?!?!
Why, whatever do you mean rapboy?
Not only did you kill all the whack rappers, but my favorite ones as well what were you thinking!
Well I just had to show these motherfuckers who's in charge
What by obliterating them?
Well how else was I supposed to let them know who's really running shit around here
No, no, you're out of control, your drunk with power!!!

[Verse 2]
Yo, let me get it, you know that I did it, my flow is outta this world, like the alien that spit acidic
Middle finger to the critics and as fresh as a fitted, soon as a bet, get the honeys wet never upset
When I catch wreck, like Bobba Fett down to collect, doesn't even register that I ain't taken a breath yet? *Gasp!*
Oh my God! Oh My God! West Deer Park done raised the rap God
Maryland I'm reppin it, dare ya to step in it
None others iller for realer the killer slash drug dealer
I get bitches erotic by slinging dick like a narcotic, you want it I brought it, hit the club and get the
Party started, yea
The flows never ending, always ascending, while apprehending anybody who's partially comprehending
Feeling limitless, quickly swallow the pill and enhance
With the killer stance, swallow the mic like a neverland
All up in yo bitche's pants, the second we dance I advance, at first glance go together like lettuce and ranch
A born winner, schooling MC's like Principal Skinner
How I murder a kill-able syllable's are no beginner
Feeling high style running through your stomach like hot bowel
I'm the only human being'll perfectly rap this
So I'm coming for ya head like john the baptist is this
This is the rapture, no camera can capture
Annihilating anybody that's violating by hating
I spit hotter than Satan, when he was migrating from heaven to hell
Step to the mic and I shall prevail
Finna blow your whole mind soon as time avail, what



[Verse 1]
See, I’m a motherfucking lyricist, bitches they fearing us
Back in the day they wasn't hearing this, now I’m the one who’s steering this
I’m self-driven, will he kill it? – That’s a lyrical given
New-School style but the 90’s is where my lyrics living
My flow is like another Earth, Second nature
I disintegrate ya’, migrate ya’, then light-saber decapitate ya’
In the beginning they said it was fabricated, as soon as the numbers escalated
But these fuckers just mad that I made it
More chains than when a slave traded check it
I’m under MC’s skin like muscle tissue, what’s the issue?
If you talking shit then I'ma hit you
Grab a pistol then whip you, then dip you in lava, ain’t no one ‘liver
Second I arrive I murder it, no you never heard of it
So sick my lyrics I don’t spit – I regurgitate them
As listeners chronologically study my words, verbatim
Assassinate em’, the second I raid them like five-0
We pull off the heist and flee to Cabo now
I mask emotions like a robbery, cause when it comes to matters of the heart
Women will clog your arteries
Visionary - V’s up – Rattpack
Young Sinatra, Maryland's what I'm reppin'
Conceal the flow behind the image like a murder weapon



[Logic]
"Hello?"

[Marty Randolph]
"Yes, hi, is this Logic?"

[Logic]
"Yeah. This is Logic. What's up?"

[Marty Randolph]
"Hi, Logic. How ya doing? This is Marty Randolph, big-time, big-league, record-executive, super-white-guy afficionado, and I just, uh, want to talk to you about a couple things."

[Logic]
"Alright man, what is this regarding exactly?"

[Marty Randolph]
"Basically, what we want to do is we want to take Logic, we want to take everything about you, and we want to take it and put it on a bigger level. How's that sound?"

[Logic]
"I mean that sounds great, man! What do you have in mind?"

[Marty Randolph]
"Basically, okay, you know that whole thing that compiles you? The whole "Young Sinatra," smooth, intellectual lyrics, the realism of who you are and how you project that, everything that you do with your music?"

[Logic]
"Yeah, man, thanks. I'm glad you spotted that out."

[Marty Randolph]
"Basically, what we're going to do is get rid of that, okay? We want to put you in the limelight with a bunch of bitches and popping bottles... cos nobody cares about that stuff."

[Logic
"...what?"

[Marty Randolph]
"Yeah, I know, right?! It sounds amazing! Maybe you might be aware of some previous work that we've done. Basically what we want to do is: have nobody remember you in five years."

[Logic]
"I don't know man... I really don't know..."

[Marty Randolph]
"Have you ever heard of Young Lollipop? Or Little Chedda?"

[Logic]
"Naw. Naw, man I haven't."

[Marty Randolph]
"Exactly. That's the point!"

[Logic]
"Wait... where did you say you were calling from again?"

[Marty Randolph]
"Oh, I'm just calling from, uh... Sell Out Records."

[Logic]
"What?! Sell Out Records?!..."

[Marty Randolph]
"Yeah!"

[Logic]
"Oh my God. Wait... like you, like, sell out stadiums and stuff?"

[Marty Randolph]
"Naw, man. Sell out like you... like you know... you know. This is what it is, man: Illuminati."

[Logic]
"What?! Illuminati?!"

[Satan]
"Yes, Logic. It's your time now."

[Logic]
(laughing) "Yo, man, who put you up to this? Lenbo?"

[Satan]
"Uh, no. No. Uh, I don't know where else to look. Look, just sign with us."

[Logic]
"Naw, I'm straight, brah." (hangs up)

[Satan]
"Oh... hello? Hello? (pause) Damn it! He hung up. These rappers are usually the easiest ones to convert...".



[Verse 1: Logic]
Living life like this is so crazy
This world is amazing
One day you're on top and then she having your baby
Living life like this I get down... Uhh
When they come around
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop this shit, they gonna run it back
Stupid shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money, my bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back cause I'm gone

[Verse 1]
(Hey) The mental state of a lyricist in his prime
Spit divine, thought from the mind
Poetic rhetoric that rhyme
We punch lines that leave you conflicted, and hit rewind
Every time I spit an ill line the worlds mine
Fuck a Matana
Quit it the second Im out the vagina
Won't even call her mañana, Sike
Lyrical Unibomber
Ima allergic to drama
Mentality of a felon
Rebelling elevate
While you repellin'
Only hate because I'm sellin'
Who you tellin'?
See I was on that raw shit
While you was on that naw shit
The people "they gonna toss it"
When that all they endorse it
I just waited for my time to shine, I never forced it
Strategically planned it like Peyton Mannin' way before shit was even real

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I remember nights as a child with my momma, hungry
But my hunger for this music is on another level
This shit will truly have you contemplatin' deals with the devil
But homie I'm a king not a pawn I never settle
Cause the strength within my mind
Is so fine I can bend metal

[Chorus]

Yeah, In high school I wasn't worried about them A's and B's
I was trying to make the flow unkillable to obtain these Gs
Murder syllables, yes I aim to please, so much ice they call me Mr. Freeze, Sike
All up under your girls skirt as if I was the breeze
Flow celsius I surpass degrees
Homie, please
And now I'm feelin' like I'm number 1
Cause nobody made it in the game out of where I'm coming from
Can you feel me?
Me and my team devised a scheme to get the cream
Followin' dreams, livin' our lives like movie scenes
Started as a teen, sippin' liquor, smoking' green
For music I was a fiend, my homies know what I mean
Ha, Lethal projectiles aimed at reptiles
Best get your money in order fore' you get checked now

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
(Yeah)The beats my bitch, the mic's my mistress
Fiance flowin' I engage, don't miss this now
Hop on the track, you know I kill it to death
Fuckin' with Logic, it's inevitable that I will result in your imminent death
Now hit rewind and take a breath, homie ain't nothin' left
I'm Gregory House and this game is testin' my patients
Been on the low like freemasons
Livin' amazing, if your shit is hot my shit is cajun
Divine white wine flowin', yes you know its aging
You got sixteens? Ha, I got mathematical equations

[Chorus]



[Intro]
I'mma just go in on this joint right now for y'all
All my lyricism heads where y'all at?

[Verse 1]
I spit fifties and shit hundreds, do shit that's undid
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts
I get em wet, no need to touch
Break they back like dutches
Keep em close like the toast I clutch
Never the less, I'm never depressed
I keep feelings suppressed
One of the best but need to listen if I'mma progress
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back
Stop, I shut it down like a bloodclot
Smoke emcees, like a fuckin bumbaclot
Mic check, I come to catch wreck
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck
I pop emcees like hymens
Y'all glass posing as studs but I'm a diamond
I reckon you need to listen, I'm never dissin'
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission
Catch me fishin, cause I'm eating for a lifetime
Wisdom in my mind, I'm a star watch me shine
Fucking your bitch from behind
Record it and hit rewind
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty
A hip-hop statute, rhymes coming at you
God bless you, when I kick wisdom it never stress you
Or test you unless you a dumb motherfucker

[Interlude]
We gon' get into it like this...

[Verse 2]
Said this is mathematic tactics, murder this rap shit
Intravenously inject my prophylactics
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks
Similar to black ice cause the flow so slick
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up
Do a whole 'lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs
Yeah, turn my headphones up
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough
Raw, rugged and rough, my alter ego Mr. Tough
I'll call your bluff, face to face never snuff
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit
No mercy cause if I grip the mic they might curse me
Da Vinci flow before I grip the mic I'm in control
Before I manifested tendons I was rhyming as a embryo
Living in vertigo half of these fuckers don't know
It's Logic—I said it's Logic



[Hook: Logic]
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this

[Verse 1: Logic]
Rap, bitches, money, cars only take you but so far
I can guarantee you that shit don't make up a super star
Time place, all good, wilin' out just like you should
Let your fingers do the talking in person I wish you would
God damn that's my jam, let me get it like this my man
Even though nobody don't understand like, like, like, like
Hold up, what's the hold up?
You like what you like, she like what he like, he like what they like
They all hate what you like and you like fuck 'em all
So much division my vision is faded
We all from the same tree but you leaves degraded
Judging the different branches in music that elevated
Just cause it's further from the roots don't mean that you should hate it
Cause there's a time and place for everything that's been created
Damn, see in the end we all fam'
But all that really matters is I know who I am

[Hook: Logic]
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this

[Verse 2: Slug]
Nobody gotta agree with me, I'm just being me
I keep breathing my speech, you be
Comfortable if we never get to speak about it
You'd rather hit your hammer, just leave without it
We got a lot of light for the storm
With more shine than that lamp keeps your food warm
And the truth is un-disputable, it's beautiful
It should be considered the usual
So I ain't judging you for loving it so hard
But you disregard that we've all got old scars
My skin looks like bark
They used to do it out in the park
Pretend to defend or neglect to protect
Depends which voice the rain reflects, connection
With all the blood invested
You would think it was the love that made impressions

[Hook: Logic]
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
My woman is a smooth vision
Aye, she my muse and I'm a musician
Love her cause a couple things she do different
Me and her be whipping running and getting money
We usually put that Pimp and Bun in and count a hundred
Listen sonny your honey won’t play that 8-Ball & MJG
I suggest you quit her now cause that bitch won't keep it G
Cause I’m an outlaw, need a ginsing for my waiter
Bobby we the Marley, high and holy, we inhale it, exhale it
Early Sunday morning, on fire getting higher
To the sounds of the Georgia mass choir
And I swear to god you ain't ever really smoked reefer till you do it to to the sound of Aretha coming loud out your speaker
Bridge over trouble water and my heart
What God has brought together let not man break apart
I swear I ain't a pair around fucking 'round with us
Cause we be like it's Pimp C bitch, now what the fuck is up?

[Hook: Logic]
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day
It spoke about music we love and music we hate
I don't know why
But I can relate to this



[Chorus: Kanye West (Sampled)]
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?" (Uh)

[Verse 1: Logic]
Chilling with my team counting this fucking money
I stay with presidents like special agents, honey
You get it from the bank, I get it from the mint
Only new bills, call me The Fresh Prince
We gon' take over the whole world
Real all the time, Rattpack so thorough
Used to rock sterling, now my shorty wearin' pearls
Fuck with grown women, no time for these little girls
I used to think about the things in which I never had
But now whenever I reflect it only makes me glad
I went from H.O.C. to chauffeurs in the H.O.V
By hustlin' tapes like they was ki's
So much paparazzi, catch an epileptic seiz'
I used to struggle with this shit, now I kill it with ease
Started nationwide, but now I'm tourin overseas
Life of a don, money blowing in the breeze

[Chorus: Kanye West (Sampled)]
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"

[Interlude: Unknown (Sampled)]
"I find (Logic) the dopest, flyest, O.G.-pimp-hustler-gangster-player-hardcore-motherfucker living today. To be honest, I am totally and completely on his dick"

[Verse 2: Logic]
They say time is money and I spend most of that with rhymin'
I eat filet mignon, reminisce when this was ramen
Yeah, yo chain shinin', but my aura is blindin'
I'm sick of U.S currency, I want millions in diamonds
Y'all roll blunts, we roll cubans
Sound of my city so soothin'
Check my method, man, bring the suits in, haters we leave 'em oozin'
Headed to the top, penthouse where we movin', ha
Bless the mic with my presence and then I teach ya
Listen carefully as I beseech ya
If I never meet ya, I hope my lyrics reach ya
Some like they ki's white, homie, I prefer Alicia (Sinatra)

[Chorus: Kanye West (Sampled)]
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"



[Hook x2]
Oh, I can't wait to say
I can't wait to say
Bitch I made it
Yeahh

[Verse 1]
Just a youngin' with a dream
Both his parents were some fiends
Living life behind the scenes
He was destined for that cream
Smoking weed, sipping liquor, skipping school
Falling quicker as he elevates with fame
All the haters they gonna bicker
Yeah, but little did he know
He was set to detonate and surely blow
That's just how the story go
Motivated just to flow
White boy with the soul of a strong negro
Let them know daddy black mamma white that's how he roll
Will he drink from the coloreds?
Will he sip from the whites?
1950s, why they fighting, fuck them both that shit ain't right
Now, raised with killers
Wolves and drug dealers
Living on food stamps and sleeping on dirty pillows
Thinking

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm living every rappers dream
Motivated by my team
Now lets take it back a bit
2006, that was the scene
Spilling ink upon my paper
High as a sky scraper
Now I'm spitting so hot that I'm salivating vapor
Forced to be reckoned
Spitting at a million mother fucking words per second
With punches like Tekken
The moment the mic beckons
This is everything, all I got
And I'mma be rhyming until they drop the casket
I mastered impeccable flows that could not be captured
The God of this rap shit
I just raptured the game
I'm the man
And you might think I'm cocky but that's not me
I say that I'm the best to envision what I want
While you partied getting' drunk
I wrote endlessly for months
Now I got so many rhyme books they can't fit inside my trunk
Now I got so many rhyme books they can't fit inside my trunk
Like

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
A natural born killer
Egotistical pistol packing mystical blood spiller
When that full moon hit
Grab the mic and I'mma leave the room lit
For the people that never gave a shit
I'mma give the world hit after hit
This is my destiny
Recipe for success is the best of me
Thank God for blessing me
With a life in this hip-hop world
In the moment that it all unfurl
Ain't no way that I'm looking back
You know I live for this, die for this
Laugh for this and I cry for this
Hip-hop metropolis
Ain't no one toppin' this
Haters ain't stoppin' this
Moment I'm droppin' this
Fans will be coppin' this
Take a moment let it sit and hall of fame is where I'm headed
Set to detonate and bitch I'm blowing up like Armageddon

[Verse 1]
Uh uh uh, yeah, V's up motherfucker what it is
Visionary takin' over the whole biz
All over your city like we in the blow biz
Never go Hollywood even though we in show biz
Baby girl, I just wanna give it to you like you never had it
When it comes to music I'm an addict
A killer, ain't none other iller for realler that's word to Dilla
Rest in peace the best with beats
And I'm 'bout to bring the heat like 5-O
Cutting records when I'm out in Cabo
Logic got more verses than the bible
I'm liable to murder anybody that pretend to be a contender
There's no better than us, the second we bust their guts, you'll trust but we get it in
Cutting records like a dividend
You can kill me but my music it will live again
Rattpack, six months on the track
GRVTY on the visual, so you know its a rap
I murder, bringing shit that you ain't never heard of
I'm goin' in raw no contraception
Red Dead Redemption, no need to mention
I'mma, murder the beat, homie word on the street, you a bitch
I plan to get rich cause my mixtape sound like an album
Your mixtape sound like shit
I don't give a damn, I am not cocky
I am Balboa even when the road is rocky
Chillin at MOCO, ya you know I gotta go
West Deer Park where I started ten years ago
Every time I see a hater they wanna get physical
Why? Cause when a girl see me we get physical
When it comes to women, I'm a Mac, you're a Dell
Pick up the mic and I shall prevail

[Chorus]
When the tide is high and the lights are low
You feel like there's nowhere to go
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
I'll be there, of this I know
And when the tide is high and the lights are low
You feel like there's nowhere to go
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
I'll be there, of this I know

[Outro]
And when the sky, is high, so high
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
I'll be there, right there, and I ain't goin' no where
And when the sky, is high, so high
And when the stars align and the sky explodes



[Chorus (Sampled): Kanye West]
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

[Verse 1]
See, I was born into a world of food stamps and welfare
No dollar for the ice cream man and nappy hair
Raised by a single mom, but in the back of my mind
I thought I gotta have my pops, no cereal
Never had a lot, but now I got plenty material
No longer do I wish for money
'Cause being broke made me stronger, harder, faster, better
So now I alphabetically murder every letter, uh
Feel the conviction in my words like a jail sentence
Murder in the first, do a verse, won't be no repentance
Mama, I'm sorry that I left at seventeen
But I had to chase my dream and get this mafuckin' cream
Only people that I got is the people that's on my team
'Cause when I roll up on the scene I see everyone start to scheme
Talk about they connections, talk about who they know
Then they beggin' me for a feature, but I'm like "Hold up, yo
If you know who you know why the fuck you ain't blow?"
Matter fact, you ain't fuck with me this time last year though
I was kicking rhymes but you ain't paid on mind or the soul
And now you on my dick riding like the baddest of hoes
You think it's easy but it's not, see the talent that I got
Determination keep it fresh, if I don't shine then it's gon' rot
'Cause it don't happen overnight, one hit wonders don't keep the spot
And I plan to hold the torch until I pass it and get shot, what

[Chorus (Sampled): Kanye West]
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

[Verse 2]
See, this is dedication, running up on radio stations
They would decline and in my mind they was just hatin' haha
Testing my patience they got me pissed like probation
But I had the mind to keep going and the heart to keep racing
And as the world crumbled beneath my feet like a Haitian
I was inspired by them to persevere through dedication
Failure I'm never facing my lyrics is education
So if you got the tape crank that shit like Jason Statham
Yeah, this is my story word by word as I'm emerging just relax and let me open your mind like brain surgeon, uh
Uhh, fresh in the game they should sign me to the virgin
But me and solo know that I would only get to splurgin'
I see the road to success and now its time to merge in
Don't forget us when you gone what my homies urging, don't forget us when you gone, uhh I gotcha
You see these Seinfeld rappers talking a whole lot of nothing so allow me to curve your enthusiasm or something
This is kinda like M.J before his prime when he dunking cause I ain't 23 yet but when I'm there it'll be something

[Chorus (Sampled): Kanye West]
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

[Verse 3]
Growing up there was baby momma drama
Everyday and every way
But now my kids I ain't got none to this day
Cause a rubber ‘round my Jimmy when I consider foreplay
Hey, back in the day West Deer Park where we stay
I was running around while momma was drinking everyday
But its okay I wouldn't have it any other way
Cause it developed me into the young man that you see today
Through dedication, yeah, yeah
Never follow traditions you see I had a different vision
I would skip school and write compositions
'Bout my home conditions
You know the usual no money and family division
In specific I remember this time in my kitchen
With my sisters man back
Before he went to prison and got into religion
He showed me how to cook crack at 12 and I ain't kiddin'
After releasing him with ba—he no longer living
And I'm pretty sure his last breath was lord forgive him
Now my nephew ain't got a father that'll keep him safe
All I can hope is he a good boy for his mommas sake
Cause she never did recover from his fathers fate
And if he grew into a man that made the same mistake
Well to be honest I don't know how much more she could take
So to every baby momma that could truly relate it is you unto this song that I should dedicate, yeah



[Logic]
One thing I think I'd like to say, and you could maybe even start the whole shit off with this is... I'm not sorry for making this album, and I made this album from a place in my heart of love... and I'm black and I'm proud as shit. That's the shit, that's the thing the whole world said I could never say or be or do. And I'm biracial and I love my fans. Swag. Flex. Rattpack

[Everybody Interlude]

[Logic]
C'mon! Is it going? Alright, what's up guys, This is day one of recording for the, I mean *Claps* Hey, What's up guys. Make sure you keep that last part in there of me explaining it because we're real all the time. Rattpack
My studio is being built

[2nd Everybody Interlude]

[Logic, Bobby Campbell, and 6ix In The Studio]
Logic: *Tapping on glass*
Bobby Campbell: *Tapping his foot* "What are you going to contribute?"
6ix: *Claps*

[Justin Fleischer]
That was the first song ever created in this room

[Logic]
Yeah, That's the first beat ever, damn
(To 6ix): But like, what's it like from, going to what's going to be in here from Charles Hall?

[6ix]
Oh, Nuts. It's gon- It's the come up. It's the glow up. It's what we've always wanted

[Logic]
Uh, Well the message for the music is just equality of man. Straight up. Straight up and down. 6 o'clock. When white people find out that I'm black, racist white people. They treat me on some like-and I've heard this, "Send your ass back to Africa, or at least the half that doesn't matter." Shit like that, that I've heard. It's like that's what I am, I'm either one or the other to these people. There's like just a handful, no more than I think like 4 songs, where I am truly discussing being biracial in America. With that being said, Those are the only times I discuss race, and it's my race. Not your race or his race or her race, It's just me being biracial and telling my story. And you might not like my story, but it's my story
You know, and then the entire rest of the album is rapped, you know, from different perspectives of a life that that dude Atom, who is being reincarnated has lived

[Logic In The Studio With Groups Of People]
There's a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is Atom. Atom but like the "first man" right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And he's talking to this random guy. And the guy's like "Life, What's it all about?" And he's like "What? What the fuck you talkin' about?" He's like "Where am I?" Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I don't know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy

[Logic On His Couch]
I can't even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, that's like the most gangster feature of all time

[Logic and Neil Recording]
Logic: So what now, what advice can you give me?
Neil: What advice can I give humanity?

[Logic And Friends In The Studio]
You guys know Big Von? He's like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL

[Steve Wyreman]
Oh Yeah

[Logic]
So he plays this guy named Atom

[Big Von and Logic Recording]
Big Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit

[Logic Explainingg Concept]
This guy Atom dies and it's a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isn't until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time I'm rapping on the album pretty much, I'm rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So it's very sci-fi, but it's very real at the same time. It's weird man, it's a good one

[No I.D.]
Hip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination

[Logic In His House]
I was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called "The Egg." I read it and it inspired me so much, and it's essentially the same thing, it's just my take on it. You know, it's a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought "wow," I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what it's like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So it's like wow, it's almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others.  They might view me as different people. I guess wow, that's crazy I never really thought of it like that

[No I.D.]
So bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, That's the difficult thing to score

[Logic]
I didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. it's just crazy, but I don't know how the hell it came together, but it did

[Hallelujah Interlude]

[Logic Outside His House]
This is so much more than just music. It's like a true personal part of my life. So, I'm getting my license, I'm doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see

[Logic Driving]
So yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, I'm like "I'm fine, I'm fine" I don't know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected

[Fan Recognizes Logic]
Fan: Logic?
Logic: 'Sup dude?
Fan: What's going on man, how's you day?
Logic: Nice, I got an appointment. What's your name man?
Fan: Raymond
Logic: *Shakes his hand* Nice to meet you Raymond
Raymond: You have a great day
Logic: Thanks brother

[Logic]
Yeah, that's a big thing that I've been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people don't understand it and that's why I'm like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and it's hard and it sucks

[Logic Making Beats]

[Logic]
It's just so crazy because I've always-like I'm on my shit you know what I mean? Like I'm on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like "you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But I'm gonna fuck you up." Like it's weird, it's crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. it's a mental thing that can affect you physically and that's why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, it's not that. It's my mind. It's anxiety

[Making of Anziety]

[Lucy Rose]
When I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that’s when you really-like I realized that he's got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when you're singing this for the first time

[Logic]
I think that's good, ah!

[Rose]
The first time in my life I have done anything like that

[Logic]
You never?

[Lucy Rose]
I'm not really sure how it goes

[Lucy Rose Back Outside]
Now listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i don't know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it

[Logic and Lucy In The Booth]

[Logic Recording "Anziety"]

[Logic]
Yo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when I'm here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin' weird, but a lot of it goes away. It's like I have purpose with you guys

[Logic Four Days Later]
Hold on, I'm trying to think... one sec'. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe that's not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... that's what I'll do, I will extend this verse...

[Records Rest Of "Anziety"]

It's always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. It's gotta be the same

[Records More Of "Anziety"]

Alright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit

I think this is harder than when I did "Gang Related."

[Continues]

Let me hear that... Woo!

[Logic to Bart Simpson figure]
So I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like I'm going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what you're doing. [Anziety bass boosted] You know what I'm saying? Gotta be really good

[Bobby Campbell]
I lost my job to Bart Simpson?

[Logic]
Yeah, you're fucking out bro

(Driving)
I was with No I.D. yesterday, Haden't seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool

[No I.D]
We shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. (Camera man: he's gonna edit that out) it doesn't matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0

[Logic]
Just out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it

[No I.D.]
My thoughts were just by far his best work, for me

[Logic]
And I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah

[No I.D.]
I mean, I can- I can rap

[Logic]
No I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, that's so unheard of

[No I.D.]
I haven't really recorded a song in 20 years

[Logic]
I texted J.Cole and I was like "Yo, Deon's rapping on my album, No I.D.", and he was like "WHAT, how the fuck did you get him to do that?" and I thought about it, and I just asked him. "Only you could get him to do that"

I've waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon

[Making of America]
The concept is how we're all and what's going on in the Native American community that's being ignored

[America Interlude]

[Logic]
America, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads

[Production of America beat]

When I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- That's why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because it's catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... that's the "ohhhh " and it goes off

You'll hear a switch up and then I'm just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and that's all he knows. And like, that's a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, you'll hear it

[Big Lenbo in the booth]

[Lenny]
When Logic approached me with the contributing to the song "America" he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song

[No I.D.]
We worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him "hey, you don't really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts."

[Bobby Campbell]
The first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration

[6ix]
What's crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didn't have the string players, we didn't have the vocalists with us. That's what's so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I can't play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit

[Lenbo]
Big Von, he just gets really entertaining

[Big Von recording skits]

[Big Von]
Got Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that.  Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories

[Logic to Damian Lemar Hudson]
So I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre

[Sam Spratt]
So, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and It's three in the morning, and I say "Bob, what's up man, what the fuck is this?" And he's like "I'm in Paris man, I'm at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be."

[Logic]
Everybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and I'm looking at the Mona Lisa like "Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy."
But then I'm looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, I'm in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like "I'm gonna go look for something else", not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this

This is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine

[Sam Spratt]
I'm like "Dude, doesn't that have like a hundred people in it?" and he's like "Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I don't know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasn't it to be representative of Everybody."

Early into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but theres limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?

I went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything I've loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover

[Logic]
This is going to be my album cover

[Sam Spratt]
The album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone else's shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly

[Logic] For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against

I didn't wanna be like "I'm biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no I'm really gonna talk about not only what's on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who don't have the voice that I do

I am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because he's amazing and awesome and he's a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, he's just been so awesome and he's just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover

[Starr]
Thank you! This is dope, so dope

[Logic]
I appreciate it, Thank you

[Patrick Starr in the booth]

[Logic]
I see good people who like to make good music and it's just that simple. Like "Hey, do you like what I'm doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?"

So I'm flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula

[Paula McKeva]
Hiii, I'm Paula McKeva, all the was from [?], Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel

[Logic]
We were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it

[McKeva]
I was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun

[Logic]
I was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun

But like she KILLED it. her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit

[McKeva]
I told him to come on the stage and said "Show me what you got." Then he went WILD and crazy. I didn't know who he was

[Logic]
After dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said "yeah."

[McKeva in the booth]

[Kev Randolph playing around on the keys]

[Bobby Campbell]
Kev, i love what you're doing, but we're gonna mute that sound

[Killing Spree Interlude]

[Booth Harmonizing]

[Confess plays]

[Logic crying]
I just had this crazy cry because I'm happy though. And I'm not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, "Anziety" and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs  and my friends and music and fans. I can't believe it. Because I didn't have anything growing up, I didn't have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- I'm not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i can't believe it's all real and happening

[1-800-273-8255 producing]

[Khalid in the booth]

[Logic] We're at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And I'm excited, I feel like I don't belong here

(to the orchestra)
I just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, I'm sorry, this is just crazy and I know we're here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality

[Orchestra plays]

[6ix]
Yo, Bob, you know what's really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FLstudio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. That's amazing, isn't that like crazy

[Logic]
Yeah, we're just like Neanderthals

(Laughing)

[6ix]
Like all the sheet music, but like what we sample

[Orchestra plays]

[Bobby Hall(Logic's dad)]
My name is Bobby "Smokey" Hall, I'm legend. I'm the legend of hip-hop go-go. I'm here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. He's just in his own zone. He's got a string session going on right now. [?] so yeah, I love him

[logic conducts the orchestra]

[Logic]
It's been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it (Crying)

[Bobby Hall]
Bobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what I'm saying? he had his own way that he lived

I took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said "That boy got bars."

[Lucy Rose]
You were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like "We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic." And I was like... excuse me? You were like "You know what I'm saying,  we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what I'm saying?" And I'm like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant

[Logic]
So when did that click for you what that meant?

[Lucy Rose]
Oh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like "What does that mean when you fuck with someone?" I thought if you're fucking with someone, you're fucking them up or something

(Laughing)

[Logic]
This is a classic documentary moment right here

[Who?]
Lucy i got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?

[Lucy Rose]
So yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, "I wen't out with a couple of fuckboys" and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?

(Laughing)

She said that just means like a lame person

Well, I fuck with Logic

[Logic]
Yeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose

[Lucy Rose]
I fuck with you all

[Logic]
We fuck with you

(Laughing)

[Logic]
It was a long-ass time ago, I'm in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in
And I'm like "Dillon what's that?" And he's like "its that P1 bro, for sure."  And I'm like "damn that's crazy, thats so cool", he's like "yeah man check it out", doing all this shit and I'm like oh my god, I gotta have this

So i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and  got the kick for "Like Woah", and it's worth every penny

[Sir Dylan and 6ix working on Ink Blot]

[Logic]
This is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but it's all myself. And he's saying like " I don't want to sleep all day and get up at night" like eh's not happy with  the life that he's living because he's one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions

It's called "Ink Blot" because one of the line is "I'm not me, I'm who you want me to be." And he's rapping like "yeah I got this money and I'm not a real rapper it's all bullshit, I'm making my money, fuck it."

Like that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, "yeah yeah I rap", but deep down he's not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. it's just a rapper who isn't happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So that's the song
[Juciy J & Logic recording Ink Blot]
Perpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man
All on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
And tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob
That’s crazy!
Yo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album
Oh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, "Aw fuck"

[Logic]
So, we're here, on Scotch Wednesday, it's a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. (cheers)

[Camera man to Logic]
Did you smoke a Jefferey?

[Logic (rubbing the wall)]
Freefalllll

[Logic]
Woah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go

(All hands on deck)

Keep going

[Jessica]
You're gonna do great. (Kiss) ... you just totally left me hanging

[Logic]
Oh, sorry

[Driving instructor]
Hello, sir, how are you doing today?

[Logic]
I'm doing good, how are you doing?

[Instructor]
You brought the whole--

[Logic]
Yeah, we brought the whole team

[Driving Instructor]
Oh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?

[Logic]
I'm upset that i did what i'm supposed to do. that's the thing I'm telling you man. It's not like a fail. I;ve failed before, many times. it's just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it

[Christian Martin]
We're at the DMV. Bob's taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, I'm a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things

[Logic]
Thank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag

Got that license though

[Black Spiderman Piano interlude]

[Logic]
"Black Spiderman" I wrote, first and foremost, it's about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and I'm not

[Logic in the booth]

[Logic]
Like, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is "Peace, Love and Positivity", and people HATE me. Like think about that... That's CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and that's so FUCKED up and I hate  that. People look at me and I go, "I'm a rapper", and they go "What?" or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look, or how i speak. "Oh, you speak white" or "you talk white", like the fuck? I've heard that my whole life I'm saying in general for this career. What do you mean "talk white"? What the fuck does that mean?

I said fuck that, why can't Spiderman be black? Why can't James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And that's why I open it up with "Black Jesus, Black jesus". And people are like "What? Black jesus? What the fuck?" Like I've got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house

[Booth Session]

[Logic]
I've known Damian for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And we've just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasn't shit, I wasn't nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And I'm sitting down there, and we're working, and I'm like "I think I need some vocals on here". And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows what's going to happen? You want to go in there, and let's see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping

[Damian Lemar Hudson]
And like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was

[Logic]
He was like "this is 6 years in the making that just came out". And...

[Damian]
I don't know, something just hit me and I started letting loose

[Damian in the booth]

[Damian]
Something about that, some type of [?] grabbed me and let me soar vocally

[Logic while listening]
YES! Praise him! I'm putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW (to Damian). COME HERE!

[Logic]
You just earned yourself a feature credit

[Damian]
It was like one of those milestones in your career where you know you're just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up

[Logic]
I only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like  when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I can't do what they do. Like I'm Batman. I'm Player 1, I'm Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I don't work with Player 2s, I don't work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. You're a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when you're with me, you're under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture

[C-Sick]
With Logic, time to go to the basement. It's my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project

[Mos Definitely Interlude]

[C-Sick]
When i first met [?] I could see this [?]

[Logic in the booth]

[Killer Mike]
I mean, he's a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, it's rich, it's moody, it revs you up and brings you down. It's an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, it's refreshing. You know? so, bravo! I've told him before, I think he's one of the best in the world

[Logic]
Mannnn, come on. Thanks man

[Lucy Rose]
Logic's music makes me feel something. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me " Why do you listen to my music? Like I don't understand". "Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music." but there's something about it I just can't explain, but it makes me really feel something

[Logic]
It's kind of scary. I can't explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isn't a bad thing. That just means I have a good life

It makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it
Ooooo I just gave you some fire!

With my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like "Yeah what's up!" trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And  this time, I'm like fuck that shit. I'm not going nowhere, i'm not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks

And I'm really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J.Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I don't need the public to accept me. I don't need anybody to tell me my music is great, or I'm amazing. Because I know I'm good, I know I'm great, and I know I'm amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know I'm good, and that's what this album is about. Knowing that you're beautiful, you're great, and you're special. Knowing that you are something, were something, and will be something

So fuck everybody else

[Credits]



[Verse 1]
Most living the life that I'm living
Is driven by money and women
But you're all I ever need girl that's a given, feel me
Now sick as fuck just heal me
My heart broken can you seal me
Baby I'm knowing that our love is ever-growing
Which direction are we going
I think we should get to slowing it down
The only girl that make me smile when I frown now
Re-interrupt but we can fix it though I wonder how
All I know is I miss the way you smile

[Hook]
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight

[Verse 2]
Now I ain't ever treat you like you was less than nothing
And I ain't ever beat you unless we talking fuckin'
So meet me halfway baby girl tell me something
You left me in the dark I pray to god the sun coming
Now its been a couple years many fears is what I face
But all that disappears when I look upon your grace
We ain't spoken for days so I guess you needed space
Did you need some time to mentally erase
The fact that I'm the only man that put a smile on your face
See when you do not talk to me my mind it just wanders
I swear to god I trust you but alone I start to ponder
I swear I treat you good, I swear I treat you right
But sometimes I do not listen that's the reason why we fight

[Hook]
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight

[Verse 3]
Now you got me feeling like I'm fuckin' mental
Won't speak to me so Imma speak up to this instrumental
This ain't the dog house shorty got me in the kennel
Now, what did I do? What mistake did I make?
See shall we persevere forward with it or make a clean break
Since the first day we met we both knew it was fate
So baby girl I guess you needed some time
But I put effort into you like I put effort in my rhymes
Now that's on everything, my best friend I tell you anything
Give you the world plus some kids pick out any ring
So know I'm down especially when we up
Half empty, half full—fuck a cup, she my waterfall
This song is just for her fuck all of y'all
Ain't looking for no Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson
I'm looking for the girl that always thought I was handsome
Before the money and some, chillin' and dirty dancing
High price hotels flower pedals romancing now
Every now and then emotions they can shift
But all of this means nothing with no one to share it with
I said every now and then emotions they can shift
But all of this means nothing with no one to share it with

[Hook]
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight



[Intro:Logic]
RattPack
V's up
Check it out listen up

[Verse 1: Logic]
One day, I woke up, and said I'm 'bout do this for the rest of my life
No question is right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies
Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies
I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm Getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around until the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate and when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it no
I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting gwap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen
Stop spending money on things that glisten
From the east coast, but we chillin it out Cali
Cause your boy got drive like valet
Poppin' bottles of that bubbly, Caillat
Leaving motherfuckers on their toes like ballet
White girls doing lines of white
And they be down to fuck if the time is right
Marry anybody if the diamonds right
And yeah we don’t give a fuck what they..
Bad bitches on they dick but I can't fade
Cause they in love with the fact that I'm getting paid
Make a motherfucker wanna roll up
Cracka hold up in a drop top, on the west coast
Shout out to my homies up in LA from the East Coast
G's Up Hoes down when we come around
V's up, mufucka from the underground
And I made it to the mainstream
With the same team
On another level but you on the same thing
Lyrical fiend and I flip it up with the same scheme
Rattpack till the casket
Flowin' no quicker then when the gas lit
When it comes to impeccable flow will leave em mastered
Getting money left and right I pancake
Got stacks like iHop can't fake
On the road to riches so there ain't no need to break
So common homie tell me what it is
Never in another brother biz
Up in West Deer Park listening to Wiz
Getting money from every direction
No question, living is a blessing
Rest in peace to the homies that ain't here today
Cause in the pack I ain't got nothing to fear today
Reppin MD, near DC, out VA, up NYC
Chillin in a whip like, like, like Visionary

[Verse 2: Logic]
And all these spanish women watching me like a novella
And even when we in the crib I still need an umbrella
Cause im getting her wetter than a letterman in the rain
We at the club hundreds and fifties I'm making it rain (Sike Nah)
All of y'all know I'm kidding like the rubber broke
Getting money and bitches but really that’s another note
And all these haters they can suck my dick
Cause honestly that's the only way you'll ever suck-ceed
Got what you need cause I sweat and I bleed
Did it all on my own didn't beg didn't plead
Everybody talk about logic, don't sell out
Bitch I had a deal for a year before it fell out
Doing shit that rappers never do you know I'm on that
So why don’t I start by telling you what was in my contract
Make the type of music that I want (Check)
Work with whoever the hell I want (check)
Keep it visionary to the death (yeah)
Cause I'm doing it for the music, not just to get a check
V's up, whaddup you know I'm on point
I be chilling with your bitch while she rollin up a joint
Making a killing for a living like a hitman
Rappers hear my new records and be like aw shit man!
Black Power, Black Card, White fist
Ain't no way a mixed brother didn’t write this
And everybody talking shit man, screw it
Cus if you can do it better than me then you do it !
Where we going, really there's no tellin'
Lyrical cocaine, narcotics is what I'm sellin'
God damn, got bars like a felon
And we getting C-notes like my homie Jon Bellion
Logic



Oh, oh, ah
Take it, take it, take it
Take it slow
Take it, take it, take it
Take it slow

[Verse 1: Logic]
Shawty I don't know you
But you know I'm trying to get to
Know you think I'm fine but my mind that's what gets you
Late night conversations, ain't no way I'm gon' forget you
So let me lay you down, baby girl let me split you
Yes you know I want it but first I'ma get to know you
'Cause this ain't about your body, take my hand and let me show you
Now what we have is partnership I won't try to control you
I just want to ride, I just want to fly

[Hook x2]
I just want to take it slow
Baby you already know
I just want to take it slow

[Verse 2: Logic]
Baby girl I think I really want to speed it up
Lay you in the bed, kiss slow let me heat it up
But I promise I'll be gentle when I beat it up
Never do it on the regular but I'mma eat it up
Kiss you, touch you, tease you
Doing anything and everything I need to please you
What it is, momma let me know right now
Ain't no need to talk I just want to bite down
On your bottom lip, let your bra rip open
Never had a feeling like this and I'm hoping
We could do it again, never thought I could find heaven within
A heart of a woman and now I begin
To understand more than I did from the start
Gimme your heart, trust me with love
Baby girl I swear you fell from above
Lend me your hand, I'll be your man
I promise to do everything that I can
I'll be your Sinatra, be my Monroe
Give me your heart and I'll know it will grow
I put it on everything baby my love is yours for the taking, my darling, my drug
And now I know, and now I know

[Hook]



[Scene IV]

[KAI:]
Up, right, L2, R2

[THOMAS:]
Dude what is that? What are you doing?

[KAI:]
Man, this shit is Rubik's cube shit...

[THOMAS:]
Rubik's cube?

[KAI:]
Man, I get so much pussy with this motherfucker...
Its amazing!

[THOMAS:]
Really?

[KAI:]
Man bitches love the Rubik's cube, bitches love this shit!

[THOMAS:]
Wow, teach me...

[KAI:]
Yes, I will...



I love listening to it from the beginning too
Like there's joints where I don't even want to hear that shit from the beginning dawg
And this is just one of them joints that, like, cites that issue
You know what I mean?
How you feeling right now?
Yeah. It's a little different, you know what I mean
But I got to keep it real so...

[Verse 1: Logic]
Thought it was love but yeah it faded now
I've been to hell and back so I'mma illustrate it now
I wonder how did I end up in this position
The fatal collision of lovers kissing, biting, play fighting
And fucking without no rubbers, yeah, we had it all
But I show no recognition as it all began to fall
Girl what was we thinking?
Love bigger than the Titanic and now we sinking
Resorting to smoking, snorting and drinking
Now I'm thinking you was my sun, I was your moon
Elegantly lightin' up every single room that you walk in
Break up, now I'm stalking, your memory
Honestly, you gave me my identity
Took the prototype and made a better me

[Talking: Logic]
Hey girl, how you doing?
It's me
You know, I've been doing a lot of thinking
And we should probably talk so just give me a call
Peace

[Hook: Kendal]
Here in this wonderless land is a boy and girl
But reading the lines on your hand
Let's me know there's more to know
Some--

[Verse 2: Logic]
Time ticks now I'm feeling ill, I gotta keep it real
My emotion's what I conceal
Now baby do you feel the level of sincerity
When I say I would kill to get what we had back
They say it's better to have loved and lost
Well, I say try it, faking like you ain't hurt but you know and I won't buy it
Used to be full of your love but now I'm on a diet
Can't you feel my pain, I know when you feel the same
I do proclaim ending that wall on my love terrain
My love for your body, remember when we got naughty
Scratching on your back, telling me that you like that
But now when I text you, you won't write back
What the fuck is up with that? I gave you everything
And now you wanna take it back? I can't handle it
Said you loved me, now you acting scandalous
Last time I've seen you everything was fine until you cut the connection
At the drop of a dime, like I ain't paid my phone bill
Fuck that, I keep it real, can't you feel my love?

[Hook: Kendal]
Here in this wonderless land is a boy and girl
But reading the lines on your hand
Let's me know there's more to know
Somehow your powers didn't leave
Oh, but mine took off with the breeze
I'm not sad, it's simply what I've come to be
And I'm not sad, it's simply what I've come to be
And this ain't home but I will live here comfortably
You will be my--

[Verse 3: Logic]
Thought you was faking but, I was mistaken
See, our relationship was long distance, for instance
Do you remember the time when I was horny on the phone
And you wouldn't pay me no mind?
I was feeling all alone but you made it better
I was the ammunition, baby girl was the Beretta
We was made for each other, she always made me feel better
See, I was tripping until I heard the news
She wouldn't talk to me, now I'm so confused
So I took a trip from Maryland to see her
Asking why she wasn't talking to me
Knocking on her door, feeling hella unsure 'til her mother answered
Baby girl, you passed away and all the emotions that I stashed away started coming back
See, I felt terrible for thinking that you left me jack
But you didn't have a choice, God had to have his favorite angel back
With the beautiful voice that I will never hear again
I'm sorry, will you forgive me?
Goodbye

[Hook: Kendal]
Here in this wonderless land is a boy and girl
But reading the lines on your hand
Let's me know there's more to know
Somehow your powers delete
Oh, but mine took off with the breeze
I'm not sad, it's simply what I've come to be
And this ain't home but I will live here comfortably
You will be my--

La la la la la la

[Hook: Kanye West] x2
(Go) go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go) go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go) go, go, go, go, go, go
On the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now

[Verse 1]
Feel like I've been waiting fo ever, for ever ever?
Through any endeavour, whatever my hand on the lever ready to go
Ready to go, yeah ready to go, uh, ready to go, ready to
This the shit they never know
I've been dealing with (hey) suits and fans talking about I'm straying from my raw roots
Well what if I told you some the music you hearing is actually from years ago
I'm talking long ago
But it's funny how the public ain't perceiving a little
Rumors started and everyone wanna believe that I'd just leave it and go
Leave it and go, leave it and go, leave it and go
Bitch I've been a beast, I'm eating like 10-a-piece
Homie put your mind to ease, keep enemies on a leash
Shout out to the homie Common, I know I'm redoing your shit
But you was fucking with the album so I'm sure it ain't a problem
A bit under pressure, nothing can measure
But all these beautiful women around me's such a pleasure
Shout out to the Rattpack
Y'all it's looking like September, I know it feel like forever but we all gon' get that together just
Go, go, go, go
I'm writing this record on the back of the tour bus
Seem like every year that pass man there's been more of us
Me, Lenny, C Dot and 6ix thought it was the four of us
And the homie QuESt, and the homie Jon Bellion
That's my [?] you know we gotta go in on
On the roll with the fever yeah I'm still on the mic
Did a show, sick as hell, but I'm still alright
You know we on that Wu-Tang, resurrect it with the band
Screaming "money ain't a thang", Visionary be the gang
When I'm done with the verse just send it to Bobby so the mix great
And when it drops, get the Castro mixtape (If it ever drops... like shit!)
Goddamn, you know I feel it
All the fans want the album, but you know I've gotta kill it first
Hella come up with a muthafucking killer verse
Rest in peace, man I wish I had a Dilla verse

[Outro]
People say the same stuff about rap music
People are just like, “Oh rap music now, oh it sucks. It’s so bad. Rap music now sucks
Now back in the day that was good rap music
That was where the good rap music was at
That’s the good rap music”
No it’s not! Have you ever listened to rap back in the day?
It’s always some dude being like :
“Well I went to the hat store today and I bought myself a hat. Ha-ha-haa”
Nigga…nigga I don’t want to hear your hat stories
So lame



[Scene V]

[THOMAS:]
Okay, so what do you think life was like before the fall? I mean we've seen pictures of open land as far as the eye can see and oceans incomprehensible in size that our grandparents would do their best to describe it. I just can't imagine life anywhere but inside a space station. I mean the simple concept of a sky doesn't even fully register...

[KAI:]
We do have fields on the Babel station and also—

[THOMAS:]
Yeah, yeah—but that's all synthetic. I mean we're heading to this planet right? That we call "Paradise", because we hope it can sustain life. Why?"

[KAI:]
Because we'll eventually run out of resources...

[THOMAS:]
Exactly! I mean what if we got there and it's exactly as the data predicted: beautiful, lush—then we destroy it just like we did Earth? There's only 5 million human beings left in the universe. I mean, it's weird to think about the fact that in 2065 the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel.

[KAI:]
Man, what's your point?

[THOMAS:]
The point is, 30 ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this. Damn near all of them return without any luck! Some of them didn't return at all. I guess my fear isn't that we won't find Paradise: it's that we'll create purgatory...

(laughs)
"Yo, this joint here, is for all my homies that I got. You know what I'm sayin', smoke to this joint, vibe out be cool. Created a little soundtrack for when they high."

Smoking on that green, got my mind faded
Sleeping on my dreams, that's until I made it (Logic)
Cuz' Bitches want it (Logic)
And women need it (Logic)
MC's, we leave 'em depleted (Logic)

Chasing dimes, like a fool
Smoking bud, Sticky Icky
Only fuck with dank, Yeah your boy was picky
If the bag was light, Told 'em call me Ricky

Then we would kick it, with some pretty girls
Skipping school, making music for the whole world (Logic)

[Hook]

Yeah you know we fly, never fallin'
Well rounded, so you know we ballin'
Women love us, fella's hate us
I ain't perfect, but I know that I'm one of the greatest



[Intro]
And to immediately start our show
I want to bring out the host of tonight's show
You all know him
A very wonderful, wonderful personality of show business

[Verse 1: Logic]
Now ain't it funny how the whole thing changed
They said I'd never make it, now their words rearranged
I went from nothing to something
But I was something all along
Who you know on the come-up doing numbers in Hong Kong
Got fans in LA, got fans in NY
Got fans down in Atlanta and all the way to the Chi
We world wide (world wide)
World wide motherfucker
They think we pay for promotion but our strength is in numbers
This is so comical, so hilarious
All these stupid groupie bitches want to marry us
And just a year ago, I had to pay to perform
And now venues across the country dropping stacks to go on
I've been working for years and sometimes I get heated
But those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it
I do it for the fans
They know what the message is
Rattpack is world wide, don't believe it check the messages

[Phone Calls From Fans]

[Verse 2: Logic]
And now I'm back but I'mma switch the style up
We moving at high speed, these fuckers are dialed up
You know I formulate my words like a dissertation
So let a brother proceed like litigation
I know you feel this deep inside of you, no penetration
We got something for everybody but in moderation
You gotta crawl 'fore you walk
I ball but you blog
Share knowledge like it's stocks
Since the West Deer Park
Back in the days and the 9 millimeter strays that grazed
My old apartment
To wherever I dreamed that's where my heart went
Now, as a baby my Mama was on the bottle
Couldn't wait 'till I was of age to hit the loto
Or the throtto and I'm gone
Like fuck the world
All I had was music and my girl
'Till that shit fell apart and this life Averelled
Never the less, I atest and "Am I blessed?" Hell yes
Occasional stress, but I only bite what I can digest
Back in the day it was jeans and white tee's
Now that I got all the sponsors I can keep up with the companies
Now I'm not bragging about material possessions
I'm trying to teach you a lesson about business and progression
And what happens when you perfect the image in your profession
Ain't no second guessing, you know it's all about perception
I used to talk about the things I wasn't really doing
But I had to visualize it before I began pursuing it
Yeah, huh, and now a motherfucker doing it
But business aside, it's been a beautiful ride
Cause I do it for the fans and brush the haters aside
I can't wait for the day I'll look within the eyes of my bride
Cause every lion needs its queen to make its children its pride but
These haters really don't know what the message is
(Don't know what the message is)
Once again, don't believe it check the messages

[More Phone Calls From Fans]

[Outro: Logic]
I just want to take a, take a moment of your time right now
I just want to thank everybody
I'm nothing without the fans
I'm nothing without my team
It's been a long journey
And this is just the beginning
Thank you all so much
I truly, I truly love you all from the bottom of my heart
Man this shit is crazy
Since day 1, I been at it
I know I probably sound real, real tired
But, shit the whole Rattpack been up for the like past 4 days trying to finish up this mixtape
It's just been crazy
But you already know what it is
Logic, Young Sinatra
Shout out to the Bobby Soxers, Rattpack all day, Visionary
I love ya'll
(Sinatra)



[Hook]
You did it baby, all the way
I never thought you'd get here baby

[Intro]
Alright alright, wassup
It's just for the fans, man like
It's just the fans right here
I'm not even at the studio right now
I'm just at the crib, like I was back in the basement type shit
It's for y'all, man
I know y'all probably like "Logic where the fuck that album, man"
I want my album to come out more than y'all

[Verse 1]
Feel like I've been waiting forever for this shit
First album in the game, I'm tryna level with this shit
My fans probably thinking "he won't never drop that shit"
But I'm tryna make it perfect so you all cop that shit
And even if it leak, I'll still do a hundred first week
Taking my time with every rhyme so not a single verse weak
See I do this shit for y'all the fans that come to every show
For the homies in Chicago always in the first row
Now y'all see the bigger picture but never behind the scenes
Everything ain't what it seems for this rap shit I'm a fiend
This is my dream, I moved to L.A., just me and my team
Most rappers only give a fuck 'bout bitches and cream
But all the money from my deal went right back to the fans
Every shirt, every tour, I paid for with my advance
But it ain't finished yet I'm sorry so here go this EP
I took a break from the album to let you know it's still me
First time I'm selling something but it still feel free
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, RattPack 'til I D.I.E

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's crazy when I hit the road and meet you face to face
To learn my lyrics have meaning and truly hold the place
You tell me something crazy like "Logic you saved my life!"
Who would have thought writing my wrongs could do such a right?
It feel like everything you've been through I've been through
I downloaded every song and watched every interview
Thank you for who you were, who you are, and who you're gonna be
I just hope that one day I'll be where I wanna be
That's when I stop you and I tell you sky ain't the limit
Shit, and as a true fan, you know what I mean
I wanna thank you for the love, for both me and my team
Cause without you, all this shit is merely a dream
Well, I gotta go the show starts in a while
Have fun, keep the peace and I'll look for you in the crowd
And if I can I'll stay after for every fan
Do my best to shake every hand and let you know I'm just a man
I ain't no different y'all we fam
I remember my first tour sleeping in the van
Now shit is like damn, it's hard to stay humble when you're the man
So I always keep in touch just to remember who I am
People hate it's in their blood it's what they do
But I don't make music for them I make music just for you, shit
It's been a long time coming, many years awaited
When I drop the album that's the day I'll say I made it
This a prelude to that shit I ain't tryna evade it
But y'all gon' look back like "he dropped that fire while we waited"

[Hook]



[Intro]
Alright, we gon' switch it up like this...

[Verse 1]
Uh, now, I'm off the hook, so none of y'all can debate it
Started making music, cause I never really related—
To this bullshit, that they spit, claiming that they made it
Similar to a eight guard, cause I can't fade it
Use your logic, you could never evade it
I'm kinda like the Young Sinatra, mixed with Sammy Davis Jr
Already knowing they are, two of the best to ever to do it
Rhyming to improve and take rap
And move it in another direction, spread like infection
Better yet, lice, cause I'm always on their mind
I'm a breed of different kind, yes
I'm ahead of my time when it comes to the rhyme
You can catch me in the booth, from dusk, 'til the sun up
That Super Mario flow, I always get the one up
Yeah, we gun up, laser gotta help me run up
Not really, but it sounded tight, shut up
Fuck around, steal your bitch, just to get the nut up
Really, what up? With everybody looking for a deal
You can call me Indy-ana Jones and I'm headed for the throne
Going on a M.J. beat, leave me alone, this is music
Who are you to tell me how to use it?
Never confuse it, originality, I'll never lose it
Maybe I'm a little psycho, for hopping on the beat
But the logical part of me, telling me, you're feeling B
See? I'm a lyrical entity, blowing minds like Kennedy
With controversial lines, so everybody remember me
I'm repping Maryland, if you bite
I'll snap on you, like a Terrapin
Flyer than an airplane, I'm just fucking around
Switch it up with various styles, just to keep you around

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Some people are entertainers and some people are great entertainers, some people are followers and some people make the path and are pioneers



[Intro]
Alright—
In the sky it's a bird, it's a plane, nah, who that?
Everybody want me to save 'em, I can't do that
Got a little shine and they wonder where the loot at
The life of an artist, I had to pursue that

[Verse 1]
Superman all the time, yeah, true that
That's why I laugh, when they ask, "Man, where the suit at?"
I love my family, love my friends
But when it comes down to money see it all depends
Cause now I got new family, I got new friends
That I never even seen before, where does it end?
See, I got loved ones and I got enemies
But at the end of the day, I don't know their identities
So they love the entities
And people befriended me for the fame
Breaking in the game, life'll never be the same
It'll never be the same, and they all like

[Hook]
You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero

[Verse 2]
I was gone for a minute, came back in a flash
Spit crack, up a dude's rock, like dash
Any dame, know I got game, go ask
This is my true identity, no mask
Most wish to get it and rub on a flask
I wish to get it and rub on her a—
Hip-Hop, what I'm talking 'bout, you ain't on
And a metaphor, means, I am hands on
Out for the green, with a buzz, like Hornet
I ain't rip the game yet, I just torn it
See? The good guy gets the dame
And if a shawty got a donk, like Lois Lane
I turn into the parapalegic, from X-Men
You ain't get it? I'm all about the brain
Step to the mic, he a beast
Hungry in the game, still looking for a feast
All about my dough, on a rise, like yeast
And I'ma keep going till a motherfucker deceased
See I stood on the side humbly, like Alfred
But now it's time, to jump in the bat outfit
And I could give a damn, if you doubt it
Cause when I hit the stage, they shout it
Uh, yeah, they shout it, what'd they shout? They shout

[Hook]
You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero

[Verse 3]
Know the flow never awkward, man
Stepped in the booth, they like, "I'll be damned"
Kid opened his mouth and shocked me man
And I get the honeys wetter, than Aqua-Man
See? That's that sex appeal
I guess that'll add another mill', to the deal
But right now, I'm just tryna get a meal
In the Batcave, sharpening the skill
With an Iron-Man mindset, they can never steal
Villain on the mic though, yeah, I had to kill it
I wrote this rhyme, in braille, just for you to feel it
Let the flow pour for a minute, but I gotta seal it

[Bridge]
Hopefully now, y'all know me, got a grip on the game
Like it was fresh up out the Sony

[Hook]
You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero



[Hook]
Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning she’ll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario
Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning she’ll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario

[Verse 1]
The way I blew up on the scene you think Osama did it
The way I’m addressing DC you think Obama did it
This is for the ladies in the crowd, gettin' loud
My intelligent women, you dumb bitches ain't allowed
I'm reppin' DMV, so you know I'm proud
They gave me a license to kill and I'm doin' it right now
On the rise like DOW, with a Jones for this rap shit
At the ten headdin' for the zone watch me catch it
That VISA flow ‘cause I’m accepted everywhere
Getting credit now beware, I’m the tortoise you the hare
See I took my time to design this rhyme
Perfecting every synonym, every syllable slowly killin’ them
Why spit game when I could just get to drillin' them
I think I’m going too fast, lets slow it down like Ritalin

[Hook]
Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning she’ll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I’m spittin' crack
Now I’m marrying the game, burying these lames
Where I’m from?—Maryland’s the name
Radio play is necessary in this game
See I dream of Danny Jones, playin' my demo at home
Get excited, call tigga, let him listen through the phone
But that ain’t happening, so I’m doing it on my own
If you think that you street, then meet me at the chili bowl
Or maybe hit the water front and we can really flow
You know I’m really cold, tell your girl to bring the fur
After I beat ya, hit Ibiza and I’m bringin' her
One in the am the club causin' mayham
My homie C Dot got two women tryin' to lay him (What?!)
Two in the am, they got my music playin'
Begging me to hit the stage, but I’m like “Who’s payin'?”

[Hook]
Three in the morning the pancake house
Four in the morning we be rolling to my house
Five in the morning the lights go out
Six in the morning you can hear us start to shout
Seven in the morning she’ll be callin'cab
Eight in the morning talking about the mush she had
Nine in the morning man she just gettin' home
Talkin' about the over night scenario, scenario



[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah fast cars with iPods in them
Young Sinatra what they blastin like a beretta
V for Vendetta, bitches sit and play just to get wetter
Haters talking shit but then they study every letter
I'm the first draft pick with the last laugh bitch
See I'm angry on the track but I deserve to be
Cause all these rappers with no talent wanna murder me
People talking shit ain't even heard of me
I went from park benches at night, to first class flights
That's what you call takin' shit to new heights
Put the 750 in reverse like Benjamin Button
We've been doing it for years and they down all of a sudden

[Chorus: Logic]
Bobbysoxer doing 120 in the corvette
Watch your boy blow up in front of your eyes, war vet
Give a fan nothin' but fire, now they want more of it
Everybody want my album it ain't in stores yet

[Verse 2: Logic]
I keep it real all the time
Like my crew when I rhyme
Just a killer in his prime with that predator state of mind
I'm set to detonate
Stack my bread and watch the paper escalate
Don't test my fate, Logic finna blow like Mary Kate
I play my role like Shakespeare
Ratt Pack ain't no fakes here
I conceal my talent like a 357
And ever since I was 11 Ive been a G
Chillin on the low key, incognito
Manipulate the steel like Magneto
Smacking suckers like mosquitoes
Dispersin' verses like a kilo
I'm Michael, the king, you fuckas is Tito
Versace frames with the green shades I only see dough
Balling like a free throw you know my steelo
I once was a prince with the vision of a king
Now I run the whole thing not defined by the bling
Exterminatin' fakes like crooked jakes killin' for high stakes
Guarantee it is my fate to be, remembered as one of the greats
No matter what it takes boy Ima give it my all
Like Jordan when he balled, never stumbled never fall
Lyrical medicine
Repeat the formula until I get it right like Edison(Edison)
Now step into my mind as I calculate lyrics like Einstein
The way he manipulated numbers I manipulate the rhymes
Like E=MC squared, nah
E= Eater of MCs beware
Watch me shine in the darkness like a flare
Married to the game, I'm the heir to the throne you been watching

[Chorus: Logic]
Bobbysoxer doing 120 in the corvette
Watch your boy blow up in front of your eyes, war vet
Give a fan nothin' but fire, now they want more of it
Everybody want my album it ain't in stores yet

[Verse 3: Logic]
Walk into a room and they staring at a brother like
What up, whats the next move, should I improve
On some shit I never gave a fuck about before
Let relationships end up cause all I do is flow
See I'm a selfish motherfucker I already know
Don't try to tell me what I'm not
Bitch I'll conquer the globe
I sacrificed my whole childhood just to explode
I want this more than what's under Mila Kunis' robe
Meanwhile Daddy's lil' girl asking for more money
But little did he know the bread was for blow money
What's in store, money, sold out shows and hoes for me
I can't fade, this the only reason I was made
To follow my dreams and manipulate these rhyme schemes like a genius spittin' the meanest
I done seen this as a child 10,000 people in the crowd
Reppin the Ratt Pack watch 'em all go wild

[Outro: Logic]
Slicin' MC’s like Vader
Motherfucking RattPack
You already know what it is
Yeah, Visionary Music group
V's up all day
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Intro]
Aw yeah
It's goin' down
It's Logic, y'all
Shout out to my boy, Rick
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
There's a choo choo train, man, he's rolling down Tragedy
Everybody knows Supernova fights gravity
[?]

[Verse 2]
It's Logic, y'all
Shit don't get me started about the one and only man
[?]
Can't forget about the one who never seems to get a chance
(Noob Noob)
All the bitches come around for Noob Noob
His dick gets more business than YouTube
Everybody, everybody is Noob Noob
Say everybody, everybody is

[Outro]
Yo, it's Logic once again, y'all, don't forget the name
Make sure you get home safe
And man, we gotta all give it up for Rick 'cause
I mean what kind of motherfucker just sets up a whole festival like this when he's completely loaded, man?
And all that stuff I said about Vance? That's not real
Vance, fuck that guy, that guy sucks dick
Woo, yeah
Yo, d-did I get paid yet? Woo



[Intro: Logic & C Dot Castro]
Flyer, than the rest of 'em
I'm higher, than the rest of 'em
My first name is Sir, so I'm sire, to the rest of 'em
Nothing but the freshest writtens in my compositions
Psychological protégé, what more to say, nothing

[Refrain: Logic]
See I'm a stain in the game, tryna scrub me out, I'm still in
I started at the bottom and now I'm spreading to the ceiling
Is you feeling this lyricism, I'm dealing like rummy, you know?
My flow smoother than gin, on its way to your tummy

[Interlude: Logic]
Nah, see? I think we should come in like this
You know what I mean?
With that ill beat, sort of give it a different type of vibe
Uh, yeah, we finna get it like this, uh

[Verse: Logic]
See I'm a stain in the game, tryna scrub me out, I'm still in
I started at the bottom and now I'm spreading to the ceiling
Is you feeling this lyrcism, I'm dealing, like rummy, you know?
My flow smoother than gin on its way to your tummy
Yeah, I'll stop your heart like a pulmonary edema
I'm so hungry I need FEMA,  and I used to be a dreamer
'Til I came into fruition, now, all of y'all better listen
And understand it's my mission, that no matter where I walk
It's my purpose to glisten cause you rappers can't see me
Like you bought the wrong prescription, but I spit that Lasik
So close, that I can taste it, while you go back to the basis
'Cause you don't know where you headed, as soon as I shred it
You dread it like Wayne's skull
I'm one of the best, to ever do it, that ain't done it yet
And yes, that might sound cocky
But I'm just gunning for your respect, that's how you do it



[Scene VI]

[KAI:]
What'd you wanna be when you grew up?

[THOMAS:]
Honestly? A musician...

[KAI:]
What?

[THOMAS:]
I know man, crazy right?

[KAI:]
Nah, what's crazy is...
Original music hasn't been created since Earth!

[THOMAS:]
I know man. Lucidity...

[KAI:]
What?

[THOMAS:]
Back then, people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness. Shit we took for granted was obvious; water, food supply. It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I dunno, I guess that's what I'm looking for...

[KAI:]
What, being able to make music?

[THOMAS:]
Not just that. If the laws are abolished following the migration—we're free dude!

[KAI:]
We're not slaves, Thomas...

[THOMAS:]
We aren't? You can't do anything outside the cause—not really. That's why we watch the same movies and listen to the same music. I mean don't get me wrong, the catalogue is incredible, but we need... I don't know...

[THALIA:]
Something more?

[THOMAS:]
Yeah, somethin' more...



[Verse 1]
Somebody let me know right now
Cause honestly I don't know right now
And I could be high right now
But I still feel low somehow
Do you ever feel, like you don't even know?
Which direction you should go?
If so homie, take it slow
Pop a bottle with some dro
Let all of your worries go
Consume yourself within this flow
Whether your girl is actin' up
Or your man was cheating on you
Or you can't pay your bills
And you can't take it no mo'
Or somebody done passed away
Be strong and live another day..

[Hook]
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think

[Verse 2]
This is Shakespeare's mind state, 808 and heartbreak
They feelin' so alone
Can someone relate to their heart sake?
Used to walk into a room
And that would make their heart race
But you ain't seen that person for some time
And now your heart aches
Now do you even know where you really wanna go?
You been down that street before
Maybe you should take it slow
Think about the life you livin'
But don't think so hard it hurts
Life is truly a gift but at the same it is a curse
Now, you gotta persevere
Get over any fear, you let go of the wheel
But I think now it's time to steer
So show 'em that you ready and show 'em that you strong
But not tonight cause you gon' get your good time on

[Hook]
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think



[Intro]
Only last week I murdered a rock, injured a stone
Hospitalized a brick, I'm so mean I make medicine sick

[Refrain]
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is Logic
And I'm in the fucking building
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is Logic

[Hook]
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it

[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay, I'mma give it to you like you never had, get you glad
Crucify that pussy, yeah your boy is bad (Boy is bad)
If you want it now then girl lets get it popping
Panties dropping, Fuck your man
Now or never shorty, we ain't never stopping
So use your logic, mama you won't get this chance again
Take you to the moon just to watch the fucking world spin
Yes I'm living right, but tonight I'm in a world of sin
Try to focus on this music but here comes that girl again
Love the way she talk, the way she walk
The way her curls spin and every time she talk to me
I feel the need for oxygen

[Hook]
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah my name is Logic and I'm in the fucking building
Searching for the shorty that is down to have my children
Break a genetic code that allows my DNA to fill him
Blood money all I know so you can say I make a killin
When I'm in your presence
My intellect what surrounds you, but we can dumb it down
No need for words, let me astound you
Take a sip of water, smoke a jack, it's time for Round 2
I beat the pussy up, like I want your lunch money
Give you the quick-stick, like fifth-gear, honey
I don't prefer beef, that just isn't my agenda
I'd rather eat beets, like a thursday in november

[Hook]
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it

[Refrain]
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is Logic
And I'm in the fucking building
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is Logic



(Knocking)

[Pops]
Turn that record off! Turn it down! You're too loud! Turn it down!

[Logic *Rapping*]
Reppin' G-Burg/ Take time/ Rape rhyme/ When I rape rhyme

(Pops barges in)

[Pops]
What the hell going on in here with all this noise?

[Logic]
Da- Dad what are are you doing, man? Why you just run in my room like that, man?

[Pops]
Turn the record down! This ain't no- I love Johnny Mathis and Nat King Cole!

[Verse 1]
Welcome, to some shit that’s considered legendary
I’m here to put the rap game in the cemetery
They told me it couldn’t happen
"Ain’t no way in hell you gon' make millions off of rapping"
But I’m just so determined
Catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon
You know I had to make 'em realize
Lights, camera, action, mofucker check the real in my eyes
Now they all looking so surprised
The dawn of a new era, like the sun I arise
Through these lyrics, I am immortalized
Strictly spitting the truth but the rest is telling more lies
This the type of shit most people fantasize
But this the shit I used to analyze
They told me I was too underground
So I took the mic out my basement and found another sound
I want it, I need it, I’m coming for the crown
Can’t nobody stop me, I’m Rocky lets go another round

[Hook]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
I’m kinda on my Roc-A-Fella meets Nelson Mandela
Raining money, no umbrella flow
Most of these people they will never know
What you have to sacrifice as a person to truly grow
See I'm in love with this shorty right
But first I gotta get this story right
Cause in this business love will never last
Sold out shows, hoes, and a whole lot of ass
Damn what a concoction, but these hoes ain't an option
Cause a woman what I'm looking for
A girl with wisdom that give me brain so insane
Or maybe I'm just going insane
On the road to success, so I'm living in the fast lane

[Hook]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

[Interlude]
You gotta be hustling, like
You gotta treat this like you selling drugs...

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Logic]
Let me kick rhymes, let me do it slow
Gotta get it every time you ain't fuckin' know
See I'm half white and half negro
So I guess that's why I got a big ego
I got double the talent so I guess I'm too nice
Tryna eat like two dykes cause I'm famished (I'm famished)
Better yet I'm in the depths of Hungary like Budapest
And even when I'm fed I'mma keep going 'til the death
Call me the collar bomba cause I'm blowing minds
Like Osama, that's word to Obama
So much action within my words there ain't no time for drama
Bringing wisdom like Dalai Lama you ain't heard

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
My name is Castro
Hotter than taking shots of Tabasco
I'm the shit, never constipated I got mad flow
Have you wondering why the fuck did he go do that for?
I don't know even my homies say I'm an asshole
My style is so defined cause I'm the definition
Of truth you want proof well then you better listen
I'm never dissin' that's a waste of time
Why waste an amazing rhyme
On them when I can take it and make it mine
I'll make it fine, homie I don't need no one's help
I stay on dimes so you can call me Roosevelt
Yeah, my flow is presidential
I rip it acapella I don't need the instrumental
So try to sleep on me, I leave you like Tom in Seattle
My wordplay is too vicious homie
So you don't wanna scrabble, you don't wanna battle
My shit will leave you without a paddle
Now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle

[Verse 3: Logic]
My wifey livin' like Oprah
Matter of fact Princess Diana
Cause my first name is S-I-R
And I don't live like no bama
See I execute my emotion through perpetual grammar
Cause my stamina colder than Canada
And hotter than Hades
I spit more than babies infected with rabies
They can't get over the fact
That I'm under their skin like scabies, what it do



[Intro]
What up, what up!?
Yeah, yeah!
Hehehe
It’s that concrete shit, you know what I’m saying? You’ll be like yeahhh, you know what I’m saying?
Word up

[Verse 1]
Ayo I think about the rap game
And Hip-Hop's life state
It makes my blood pressure rise like Maryland's crime rate
Rip through the city like the sense, of false virility
From cats that clutch gats and lock down the vicinity
A lyrical entity, that hold it down and never pretend to be
Something I'm not, like crush rocks and bust Glock shots
But I've seen it, to the level where I began to fiend it
And now life is beckoned into reality, no need to dream it
I, Step to the mic and rock heads like Mount Rushmore
Raid the spot like cops catchin' a dealer tryna flush more
Down the drain, liquor down the hash to drown the pain
I surpass; sustain, solidified within its game
The king is dead, long live the king now watch me reign
Spit fire that I obtain from leavin' the dragon slain
My name is logic but you may know me as young sinatra
The cat that brought ya
If I may say the illest of verses
Not yet classics but that will come as time disperses
Back in the 90's I was just a badass kid
Thank god for sparin' my life and dogin' a bid
West Deer Park after dark I rep to the death
Gaithersburg high blastin music til I go deaf
Ninth grade on the constant pursuit just to get laid
Til' I finally got some pussy now I'm trynna to get paid
Sold a lil bit something slight like nickels and dimes
But I ain't make enough, said fuck it and stuck to the rhymes
As for my home situation, that shit was hard times
Came up on my own blocked out the bad went into a zone
Acknowledged what it was but never let it consume my chromosomes
On the phone at like sixteen with a lil hispanic hottie
Body like a ducati the type to get naughty
Now I’m twenty-one, older and wiser but I ain’t perfect
Specially when that dark shit deep down hit the surface
And ignite the art, maintain speed rip it apart
Fuck a punchline this the shit you feel in your heart
A young black man camouflaged in the skin of another
When I converse with white folk, I feel like I’m undercover
Just a brother, tryna make it in America
I need a window seat somebody call Erykah
Bars like this, cause mass hysteria
Spread like malaria and quarintine your area
I squeeze at you emcees til you weese and bury ya
Alive, like Beatrix Kiddo that’s a Kill Bill
Shit now run it back and relive the riddle
What



[Intro]
I, am the greatest
I, I, I, I, I (am the greatest)
I, am the greatest

[Verse 1: Logic]
Fuck 'em, I will never love 'em, I'm way up
Bitch you know I've been above 'em (the greatest), I stay up

[Transmission: Thomas, Thalia & (Kai)]
Shit never works, how do I turn this thing on?
Cheap shit never works
You have to push the button, Thomas
(Yeah, the one on the top right, where it's always been since the beginning of time, fucking dumbass)
I heard that, bite me Kai



[Intro - Big Sean]
If I want it
If I believe I can have it
Then that's my reality
I'll attract it

[Hook : Jay-Z]
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Everything I do I'm a man behind mine
(throw your hands in the air) and stand behind mine
Everything I seen made me everything I am
(If you're real as me)
And stand behind mine
Everything I do I'm a man behind mine

[Verse 1 : Logic]
Yeah, yeah, visionary the second coming of Roc-A-Fella
Resurrecting the real like holograms at Coachella
From Maryland where they throwing up signs like Hellen Keller
Cutting records like helicopter propellers that propell us to the sky
While these motherfuckers wondering why we get high
Never knowin' Imma be flowin' 'till the day I die
Livin' life followin' my dreams, everything ain't what it seems
Everything ain't what it seems, when you're climbing to the top
Label asking for my album, the single ain't even drop
But the fans anticipating greatness can't fuck with fakeness
Rattpack until I D.I.E that's where I'm finna take this
V's up motherfucker let me get it right now, sorry for my lateness
I dedicate this to all the people that love to hate us
Never mistake this I'm getting money but keep it real
And got my eyes on a diamond like I'm a centre field
Motherfucker how I feel

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Hit-Boy]
Still at the intro, my "I'm tryna convince flow"
Getting it how I live through rhymes written with pencils
Time stuck in the interm, dreaming of living better
I'm Nagina Market, questions like "how we get this cheddar?"
Bread and this lettuce, if you don't give it up I'm takin' it
I'm in love, had a date with fate now I'm facin' it
Fuck niggas away from me, baby mothers waivering
Little momma like your son home, just embrace the kid
Cause I'll be here for a minute like I'm going 60 seconds
Every time you hear a record and it's great, think of me
How many song they got sound same 53
Who gon' save the game, shit that shouldn't be a mystery
We the plug, that's the team, clean the guns, pack the beam
I the skull *badabing* and they gone
All that weak shit exposed get it buried
Said a word and I’m releasing the levee

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : PriceTag & Oktane]
Boy, I used to practice my autograph in class nigga
I guess I always knew I would be that nigga
They want you to second guess they want you to doubt
So we just became the kids that our parents warned us about
Wanted to bounce from the crib soon as I graduated school
Was there shit else I could learn, I had to make my own rules
I hit the streets with them young mechanics
That was holding them tools
You disrespect them son in their hood and get screwed
Nigga now move!, now tell me who wanna fuck with us
Ash it and pass it, fuck a Dutch
I smoke through the glass then I'm up
I feel it in my chest, boy I ain't no stressed
Boy this is chess motherfuck the rest
(who are the best from the westside)
Now let's ride down to Cali streets
Where them babies ain't nourished
Young niggas gone ride, cause them niggas got courage
Screaming for help but nobody's heard it
The streets ain't got service
Get rich or live trying word to Curtis I gotta flourish
Man I earned it better learn it from my name down to the block
I’m a product of the I.E. Blink 182 and Pac
And it ain't no kinda stop button
Your fade back and you stop frontin'
When you realize I'd die for this and you ain't ready to pop
Off shots to take your shit to the top so just let it go
See I puffing on medical with your girl as my passenger
I advise you to let her go, talking crazy get back back move
I'm holding paper like the backpacks do
It's B.O.W. with the Rattpack crew nigga what!

[Hook] x2



[Verse]
And all these Spanish women watchin' me like a Novela
And even when we in the crib I still need an umbrella
Cause I'm gettin her wetter than a letterman in the rain
We at the club, 100s and 50s I'm makin it rain, sike nah
All of y'all know I'm kiddin' like the rubber broke
Gettin money and bitches but really that's another note
And all these haters they can suck my dick
Cause honestly that's the only way you'll ever succeed
Got what you need cause I sweat and I bleed,
Did it all on my own, didn't beg, didn't plead
Everybody talkin 'bout "Logic don't sell out!"
Bitch I had a deal for years before it fell out
Doing shit that rappers'll never do you know I'm on that
So why don't I start by telling you what was in my contract?
Make the type of music that I want... check
Work with whoever the hell I want... check
Keep it visionary 'til the death, yep
Cause I'm doing it for the music not just to get a check
V's up, wuddup, you know I'm on point
I be chillin witcha bitch while she rollin up a joint
Making a killing for a living like a hitman
Rappers hear my new records and be like "aw shit man"
Black card, black power, white fist
Ain't no way in hell a mixed brother didn't write this
And everybody talking shit man screw it
Cause if you can do it better than me then you do it,
Where we going? really there's no tellin
Lyrical cocaine narcotics is what I'm sellin ahhhh
Goddamn got bars like a felon
And we gettin C notes like my homie Jon Bellion, yeah
Visionary to the fullest
We came up out the blue like a crip shootin bullets
Where I'm from muhhfucka I'm from Maryland
G-Berg wuddup, I'm snappin like a Terrapin, flyer than a airplen
Shit I mean a airplane, rapping so fast I can't even get the air to my brain,
Runnin the game like a PS3, flippin the bird to anybody that BS me
Chillin in Cali but you know we from the E.S.T,
I got the game in my hand like a PSP,
Chillin with the homie Castro sippin' 40s
Drop an album out to the fans, cop'em like the police
Rattpack 'till I D I E, greatest rapper to ever do it, I gotta agree, shit
Fuck em all, everybody appalled, flow so clutch my career never stall
Me and my team went to Vegas last week and like a bunch of old men yeah we balled
I'm tryna do it like ain't nobody done it bitch I run it never plummet you know I'm headed to the summit
And a note to all you rappers tryna do it how I done it
It's impossible rewind the track and learn something from it I'm gone



[Intro]
I would like to make an announcement
To everybody that said I wouldn't amount to anything
In the lines of music

I told you, what did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?
Cause I told you
Mmhmm
And when did I tell you?
A long time ago
And what did I say?
What happened when I told you?
Exactly what just happened

[Verse]
I love to jump up on the track so poetic
But the champagne I'm sipping got me spitting moetic
The second I aim, I dead it
Now give me the credit
'Cause I envision myself living in wealth
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Lunch at Louis V's
Now excuse me please
I got dinner plans overseas
Killin' with ease
Young Sinatra got your girl
And now she a Bobby Soxer girl with nice clothes and thick curls



[Hook]
Yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights, yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights

[Verse 1]
Yes, I want it all from the big to the little, things
When you hear my voice it rings
C-notes in my pocket, cause logic does not prefer to sing,
All the women know what I'm about
Make music then i dig 'em out
Cause I got it, flow hypnotic
And not a single one of y'all doubt it
And when I think about the life I live and the studio time I give
To the fans in the stands, usually kill it but now you can dance
Cause this is a banger, logic is not a stranger
To makin' that music that make you feel better
Whatever, whenever, however I'm just rhyming oh so clever
Gotta flip it up just like coke
Step to this mic in this murder I wrote
I feel like i can keep it real
On my independent shit cause i don't need a deal
You see I want it now
Step into the stage and everybody wonder how
How you kill it like you do?
Every time that you walk through
Yes i want it all, but i don't have it all
So I'mma stand tall, until i get it all, until i get it all

[Hook]
Yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights, yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights

[Verse 2]
I want the most dead presidents like VA graveyards
Rappin' is a profession, why you still at your day job
Yes, I want it all—that money in the –illions
Why make trillions, when we could make gillions?
You can check the swagger, stuntin' on 'em like Knievel
Pussy in my lap, blastin' off like Dr. Evil

[Hook]
Yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights, yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights










Letra de "1-800-273-8255" ft. Alessia Cara & Khalid[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Juanes]
Y ya no quiero esperar
Por alguien que venga a salvarme
No puedo esperarte hoy
No puedo sanar
Ya no quiero esperar
Por alguien que venga a salvarme
No puedo sanar
Y déjame explicar

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Juanes & Logic]
En este dolor, buscando una señal
Siento que mi mente está mal
Como una vida no tan real
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Juanes & Logic]
Yo quiero verte soñar
Yo quiero verte volar
Y no te dejes caer
No te sientas mal
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic & Juanes]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
En este dolor, buscando una señal
Siento que mi mente está mal
Como una vida no tan real

[Chorus: Logic & Juanes]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
Ahora quiero respirar
Ahora yo quiero soñar
No quiero fallar
I don't wanna die

[Bridge]
I just wanna live
I just wanna live

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore



[Verse 1]
I'm ready to go and I'm ready to bang
I'll never be doing the same old thang
I'll give it my heart so I give it my whole
I'm ready to stand and I'm ready to fall
It ain't ever gonna get better, you see?
Your best homies will become your enemies
Anger will fill up your whole entity
Trying to live out the life of a G

[Hook]
Never mistaken I’ll never be faking
I’m givin you wisdom so best get to taking
Now why in the fuck would I lie? (Fuck would I lie) x3
I’m giving you everything that you need
Everything that you need to succeed
Now why in the fuck would I lie? (Fuck would I lie) x3

[Verse 2]
Now tell me how you’re gonna be a real killa
Fake mother fucka with a real nine-milla
Live in a tin but I’m ready to rhyme again, avoid the pain
Now tell me what I gotta do to maintain
The mainframe, to keep my life the same
Not a damn thing ‘cause your life needs change
Psycho-logical know
How to flow. Stack dough fo' sho
When I do what I do, I do it for you
Him, her, over there, you too. Who knew?
When I ride I do it to make money
Up in the drop top whippin' when it’s sunny
Gambino flow is how I roll
All y'all rappers who just don’t know
Your track is preposterous
My library monstrous
Y'all know who the bosses is, S-I-R-7
Breedo, royal, brethren

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What’s up with the honey in the back?
Shaking what she’s got, trying to earn a fat stack
You’re losing your self respect
Twisting your body, your ass, and your neck
Used to be a woman, now you’re just a bitch
Your booty is passing by all these good guys
Tryin' and sewin' some between your thighs
Fuck that, open your eyes

[Hook]

[Marty Randolph]
... Hello? Eh- Have a good day



[Intro]
My mentor once told me, that fire cannot be denied,I'm twenty years old, and I've sacrificed the last four years of my life, to create music just for you, my social life, staying in the studio, practicing, grinding, just to give you, a soundtrack for your life, so I'm gonna continue to wake up every day and make good music, and get that recognition

[Hook]
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it

[Verse]
Uh, yeah—
Now, let me switch it up with some shit you ain't ever heard
Ain't drunk, but the flow's slurred
Everybody just relax and listen to my words
Everybody just relax and listen to my words
So many times have I designed a similar rhyme
That came to mind
You're never to find the way I'm feelin' now
You're never to find the way I'm feelin' now
You're never to find the way I'm feelin' now
I'm feeling like I'm ready to blow
Been waiting patiently, but fuck it, now I gotta go
When it comes to making this music, man, it's nada, yo
See? You can't comprehend the amount of heart that I'm givin'
Hip-Hop's my chauffeur, so you know I'm driven
Sunrise to sunset, you know how I'm living
You see I think it, then write it, read it, repeat it
Then lace it, produce it, record it, mix it, then master it
So the people adore it

[Hook]
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it



[Intro: Phil Ade]
Yo it's your boy Phil Ade
Ah man it's crazy here
Logic, I think they're ready for it
Let's get it!

[Verse 1]
Yeah I got it now what is it—pay the world a visit
Let them know I'm 'bout it with this golden ticket
See my curriculum is flippin' 'em
A hundred and fifty one yeah we sippin' 'em,
Bitches they trippin' all up in the club
Show me love if you really 'bout it, I don't never doubt it
One of the best out of Maryland
I'm down to shout it (Oh really?)
Never cocky I'm just confident the flow is prominent
This is the reason that I'm dominant
That automatic platinum plated flow know I'mma shine with it
All of y'all is down to conform but I realign with it
Performing at a full house, feeling like Uncle Jesse
Bitches they stress me, take them to the crib undress three
Children lie, men lie, women lie then we die
But I'm here to tell the truth and let you know I'm finna rise
To no surprise, fake rappers meet your demise
The microphone and Adobe Audition my only supplies
Look within my eyes, yes I'll bury the odds
Now I ask 'em, is you feelin' me?

[Verse 2]
I got it back and now I'm on again
Hit you in your chest like breathing after a shot of Gin
I'm just a living organism that has arisen
With so many bars I can manufacture for various prisons
So let me show you what I'm bout and baby how I do it
Flowing for hours every day just so I can improve it
When I perform I envision a crowd and how to move it
See I am lyrically inclined
Alphabetically take apart and rebuild your mind
I'm on my grind and guarantee ain't no style like mine
I bring the force of course with no remorse
I'm married to the game don't even talk about divorce
'Till death do us part, reincarnate then restart
With Biggie's eyes, Big L's mind, and Pac's heart
Rip it apart, intravenously like poison dart,
Y'all bananas if you think I'm slipping in Mario's Kart



[Phonecall]

[Verse 1]
I blow your mind like cocaine, nah
I blow your mind like Cobain
Rest in Peace
Sucker MC's deceased
Rise on the East I'm the sun bringing heat for sure
I've been making tracks on the low
Waiting for my time to shine and then blow like Johnny, Depp
Increase the rep
Like a bench press set homie yes I get red
Paid my dues but I'm still in debt
Cause I have no credibility in the game yet
Gotta apply, and run a background check
But I bounce
Cause I ain't done shit yet
Right now, that's what I'm trying to do
Stay spitting rhymes whenever I roll through
Call me the Grinch, homie I don't give a hoo
Any MC yes I gotta kill you
But don't take it personal it's business fool
Do like Travolta just be cool
And nowadays everybody sound the same
The Price is Right, but I don't play that game
Won't never stop 'till they all know my name
Gotta grind to the top rid Rodriguez with the fame
Homie if I kill you accept that you're gone
This ain't Call of Duty you can't respawn
Had your girl down talking on jive
'Till I hit you with the MP5
Suppression, I really hope y'all learned your lesson
And never forget that I'm the unsung freshman

It feel like just yesterday I was broke as hell
Livin life behind these bars like I couldn’t make the bail, shit
Workin at Wingstop cookin chicken that was boneless
Till my sister kicked me out before Christmas and I was homeless
Girl I ain’t mad at ya you know I love you the same
Cause all I did was light the fire to break up in this game
I had a girl for a while, she was the love of my life
Thought we’d have a couple kids, she’d be my lover, my wife
Till she felt it wasn’t working so I asked what was next
She said “nothing” and left me with that goodbye sex
That was 2010 felt like I would die then
Till I packed up the mics and fuck it all and fully dived in
Fast forward a couple years my flow is fully infectious
Up in your system like Tetanus, close to your heart like a necklace
In private events, Kevin Liles and John Gotti
Trey Songz and even Trey’s mom what a party
This the life that I’m livin, can’t forget where I came
Maryland just like Monroe man all of y'all know the name
It’s been a long time comin, and this music all I got
And even though I knew I'd always make it still who woulda thought
Def Jam, goddamn, but you know we keep it visionary
V’s up, till we on top like missionary

Conversations while the Empire State in the backdrop
Spittin bars with Nas on the Manhattan rooftop
Talkin business and predicting what quarter the tape will drop
15, writing rhymes, inspired by Illmatic
I’m still at it, every record I record leave the record shattered
Cause I’ll be in the lab for a month
Searchin for inner peace through meditation like a monk
I’ll be, makin that music, makin, makin that music that
Resonates from the burbs to the hood
I remember wishin Yeezy would sign me to GOOD
But now we on the same label so the shit’s all good
And to be honest I’m glad that I did it myself
Cause I know what’s in store like I stock the shelf
All the hip hop fans, they gotta wait through the commercial
But they know the feature presentation gon be universal
That rehearsal thinkin bout my life
And how you know I refuse to be blinded by the light
And everything is all right
RattPack, Visionary all day it’s Logic

I’ll be spittin this never written ridiculous goddamn off the top of the dome
I’m murderin every single one of they chromosomes
I’m reppin Maryland to the fullest, push us but never pull us you know the deal
This is how we do it all the time, we keep it real
It’s that RattPack, hit you with a gat, crack crack
Like that never slack goddamn now can you feel it
Can I ride wit ya, paint this picture like I got it so ridiculous

I got it like that, ain’t no need for grippin the gat
Keep it ratt, never slack, motivation attack
Goddamn I could feel it this is strictly off the top
It’s never written cause that shit is forbidden
I’m never kiddin like the miss that’s on that birth control
Goddamn, the second that I feel the vibe
And yes I’m fuckin up so that’s how you know that this shit is so goddamn real
Tell me how you feel, how you feel, never squealed like that
Blat, hit you with a gat, sike nah
NYC to MD the L-O-G-I-C I’m reppin in
Yes I gotta get it, second that we steppin in
It’s strictly off the top
I could feel the energy, I ain’t talkin E-N-E-R-G-Y
I mean inner G, that’s the shit they never see
But I’ll hold supremacy, number one I bet I’ll be
Bitch I said I better be
Tryin to take my kindness for weakness
Get the better of me, fuck that
Never stop with that
This is how we doin, pack it back then I hit that
Ridiculous, understand it’s ridicule'less
You can never top this, you can never stop this
Hundred thousand first week, album when I drop this
Goddamn can you feel it that’s the man
Said it’s Logic



He was a, class clown
Lover all around
He was kind of goofy
Make you feel good when you're down
But one day he disappeared and never came back
At 17 got kicked out by his mother just like that
He moved in with his father
That he never grew up with
But we're not gon' get into that like cocaine we gon' cut it
He loved music, but never had the time
Cause he was working two jobs and they both was overtime
His girlfriend always told him that he was destined to shine
He smiled, said "really?" but really paid it no mind
And when he was of age the situation was shitty
So he packed up all his stuff and then he moved across the city
Went to the room from his homie's mom and dad
They saw the situation and they felt so bad
They let him live with 'em, and he was doing good
Working at the street fixing cars under their hood
He got up with his mentor, that he knew for a while
He met him back when he was a youngin' only a child
A real good guy
That gave him some equipment
And then he sent him packing like a UPS shipment
He said "lay some tracks, and maybe we can get it"
So then he quit his job and he moved in with his sister
They lived together as children so yes he really missed her
But then he got another job, still working on music
Tryna find a style and figure out how to use it
But one day he got it
Yes he's so excited
But then he stopped
Said I got a way to go on top, they gon' find me
Such a long journey like I'm walking I-90
Three thousand miles leaving the haters behind me
Along his path, he ran into a wise man
Said "please tell me how I let 'em know I'm great"
Wise man then said "drop a mixtape
But not just a regular shit that everyone doin'
You gotta let'em know that you for real on what you're pursuing"
Then he was gone, just as quick as he came
After this encounter he would never be the same
'Bout 100 miles and runnin', he started feelin' something
What's that?
Maturity
Every single night, sacrifice rest to write
Dusk 'till dawn he be rapping 'till the sun up
Call him super Mario he always get the one up
Finally dropping tracks, now the mixtape is completed
His appetite for perfection was seriously needed
Then it dropped
He would, sell it for twenty but his country in recession so
Take it for ten homie consider it a blessing
Yes he a rookie, but you know they respect him
That Botox flow, so whenever he inject 'em
Them haters tighten up their game but now it don't affect him
'Cause if they step out of line yeah you know he finna check 'em
He grew up on the bottom, but dreamt about the top
He finally found out that until he reach it he won't stop
He's headed to the summit, where everybody plummet
The game need change and Logic can break a hunnit
The consul to the game so you know we run it
Nah, that last line was, over dramatic
But he coming for that ass and he gon' let 'em have it

[Verse]
I don't even know, tell me world, where am I to?
Young, broke and infamous, I'm feelin' kinda low
Love game fucked up, money game ditto
Studyin' the greats, but they got me feelin' little
Feelin' like a crazy person, feelin' a genius
Feelin' like an asshole, feelin' like the meanest
Where am I to go now?
Where am I to go now?

[Chorus]
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous

[Interlude (Sampled)]
Mighty strokes of war
Have already been dealt against the enemy
What kind of a people do they think we are?
Is it possible that they do not realize
That we shall never cease to persevere against them
Until they have been taught a lesson
Which they and the world will never forget

[Chorus]
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous
I said, we're young, broke and infamous

In the booth where I'm driven
Yeah the flow's so wet that I keep a bitch drippin'
Hand me the mic and I guarantee I'mma be rippin' it
Automatic static yes I keep the extra clipping it
A small town boy with a big city swag on
My CSI tip, tap a bitch and then I bag her

(looking at, looking at, looking at me)
Just a fly young brother staying repping MD
(looking at, looking at, looking at me)
Steady getting green I ain't talking 'bout the trees
Jump on the track, homie you ain't seeing me
License to kill, registered at the D.M.V
Just got the title most underrated MC
But it's aight this ain't the last you finna hear from me
Just the beginning I'm Michael Phelps when he's swimming
I'm the rookie Barry Bonds in the very first inning
In other words, homie I'm steady chillin'
But all these other MCs form and they grillin'
Most people drop tracks but me I spill 'em
Stain in the game try to scrub me I will still in
Yes you know I get it like a bad bitch I hit it
Middle finger to the critics cause I'm sick just admit it
Charge me as a wack rapper but I was acquitted
Judge me on my skin color but my father is a brother
Finally heard the flow and now you know I'm unlike any other

[Lady Gaga]
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pick it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks

[Intro]
This right here, homie
This that first take shit, you know what I’m saying? For my real heads
All my real hip hop motherfuckers, they know they're Roots shit, you know what I mean?
So we gon' get it like this
Let that beat drop, Psychological

[Verse 1]
I spit fifties and shit hundreds
Do shit that's undid
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts
I get 'em wet, no need to touch
Break their back like Dutches
Keep 'em close like the toast I clutch
Never the less
I'm never depressed
I keep feelings suppressed
One of the best but need to listen if I'mma progress
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back
Stop, I shut it down like a bloodclot
Smoke MCs, like a fuckin bumbaclot
Mic check, I come to catch wreck
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck
I pop MCs like Hymens
Y'all glass posing in studs but I'm a diamond
Now recon, you need to listen
I'm never dissin'
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission
Catch me fishin'
Cause I'm eating for a lifetime
Wisdom in my mind
I'm a star watch me shine
Fucking your bitch from behind
Record it and hit rewind
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty
A hip-hop statue
Rhymes coming at you, God bless you
When I kick wisdom it never stress you or test you
Unless you a dumb ass motherfucker

(Psychological) Yeah, no want no more
Fuck it, ayo

[Verse 2]
Said this is mathematic tactics
Murder this rap shit
Intravenously inject my prophylactics
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks
Similar to black ice cause the flow so slick
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up
Do a whole 'lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs
Ah, yeah, (Turn my headphones up)
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough
Raw, rugged and rough
My alter ego, Mr. Tough
I'll call your bluff
Face to face never snuff
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit
No mercy cause if I grip the mic they might curse me
Da Vinci flow
When I grip the mic I’m in control
Before I manifested tendons I was rhyming as a embryo
Living in vertigo
Half of these fuckers don't know

Yeah, all day
Drop tracks like that
All nuts in
Maryland stand up, that's it
I'm out, peace, one love
Fuck if you doubt me

(You are watching a master at work)
Todd? Todd? Would you care for a glass of grape juice?
Nigga, what the fuck is juice?
I want some grape drink, baby



(Big L rest in peace)

[Verse 1]
2 A.M., just got outta the bar, headed to my car
Me and Castro kind of blown 'cus we parked so far
Walkin' down the street, spot a couple of goonies on the creek
Pockets full of cash, so we dash fast, to avoid they ass
Cause we know they trailin' now we on the run
Heavily inhaling, exhaling as I begin to caress my gun
We gettin' closer to our destination
I always mind my business but, somehow I find myself in these situations
Death what I'm facin' if I give up now
They startin' poppin so you know we exchangin' bullets in the street
He dropped one but, I graze another
And in the heat of the moment I thought about my girl and how much I love her
Prayin' to god that tonight wasn't my last supper
Cause they tryin' to spill my blood and break me for this bread
Motherfucker take all this lead, yeah that's what I said
That's 2 down and 2 to go
But, then the others disappeared yo
So, now we on the roll, finally made it back to the car
My homie thinkin' that we all good but, hold up there they are
Buckin' fast in the XLR
Goddamn what a mission
Thought process, keys to ignition
Try to ditch 'em, so now we in the whip speedin'
Dodgin' bullets as we proceedin'
'To my man lenbo
These bammers try to play us like nintendo, hell no
Hit him on the phone, let him know we wasn't alone
Comin' through the zone, my homie picked up before the dial tone
"Whaddup my man, what's good? Is everything ok?"
Hell naw, get your heater and be ready to spray
Pulled up to his crib and my man was ready to go, ha
Jumped in the back with a semi-automatic
Bustin' eratic, quite the lethal weapon addict
So, we let 'em have it
Weaving in and out of traffic until we lost 'em
Whippin' for a couple of minutes wishin' we could've tossed
So now I'm drivin, thankin' god that I'm still survivin'
Received the call from my man boss, he was chillin' and vibin'
Said he was on the road, found out about a pack of waves
So, I said that's getup, I got a story that'll blow you away
Couple minutes passed, met up at a red light
Called him on his celly celler
"Lets hit the deli and grab a bite"
So, now it's me lenbo and Castro inside of my car
Plus, my homie boss trailin' behind us but, not too far
Now we on the strip, everybody coolin' they jets
'Til I hear my man Castro yell out "oh shit"
Here come the motherfuckers again out the blue like a crip
They must've followed us tryin' to take out the whole lot of us
Now they bustin' at boss
Movin' through the tired and I made them crash
Now they comin' for ours
I hit the uuee while, my man blast
Hit the passenger in the door, now his brains up on the dash
The driver stopped, tryin' to clean the blood up off the glass
Givin' us just enough time to go and pick up boss' ass
All together, started raining I hate this weather
But it didn't matter, only thing on my mind is vendetta
Cause that was for the one
He scared as shit but, we chasin' sun
Hit the highway, doin' it up by a buck and some
Castro halfway up the sunroof firin'
No fear, so, I guess that's what I do admire him
Duckin' Strays, 'til he caught one in the shoulder
Fell back, gushin' blood, but, my man's a soldier
He hit the exit, now we whippin' through the city
Contemplating, how the situations getting shitty
Now we out of ammo, so. we sped up to the side of his ride
And tended to collide hit him quick and watched the whip slide
My man boss strapped the gat from lenbo half out the window
Shot the gas tank, we watched the whole thing blow
Now we laughin' headed to the hospital for Castro

[Verse 2]
Oh no, I guess popo got wind of the blow
Cause like 15 cars came out of nowhere yo
And now they on pursuit, didn't even hesitate to shoot
Murder weapon possession in the trunk for the loot
If we get caught it's either life or death so fuck 'em
Might as well go out blazin' we might just duck 'em
Hit a hard right, goin 120 through a warehouse
Hit the lights in the engine so, they don't know our where abouts
Just around the corner was a bridge out of the city
No cops in sight, me and my homies feelin' giddy
My man, Castro, was like fuck them coppers
But, speak of the devil 'cause appearred two choppers
They lights on us, callin' out cars to our location
Mind racin', checked the rearview
Saw every cop from the fuckin' station
And what was comin' and the bridge was risin'
You shoulda saw it, told my boys to buckle up cause i'm about to floor it
Everything was perfectly aligned and we was at a good speed
My homie lenbo didn't hesitate to spark the good weed
Feelin' like I'm home free halfway up the ramp
Escape is my goal, but, open fire hit the tire
Now we outta control, off of the bridge we go

[Skit: Logic + (Castro)]
(Logic, Yo Logic, Yo wake up man, Logic, Yo wake up man, Logic, wake up man)
Wassup?
(We're finally here, man)

Feeling so damn fine like Mos Def in Brooklyn in a park
West Deer Park come out after dark, that's where the murder start
Don't let me stop let me stop, let me keep it going
This is how we do it
Switch the beat up again, swith the beat up again come on!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Check it check it let me keep it up
This is how we do it let me beat it up
I'm feeling this villainous vibe, this shit is hella crazy
You never amaze me, I'm never feeling lazy
Like I said this is random thought, the shit that can't be tought
It's just emotional
I never provoke it, I spit it, never choke it
Goddamn this ain't, no 8 Mile, B-Rabbit
The second I spit it I gotta have it I gotta do it
Never dab it like my homie Slay Dro at the crib
This is how we do it put it in the bitches' rib
Everything I got is what I'm, finna give
But my queen, she's a beauty
This is how we do it goddamn such a cutie
Uh, let me spit it yeah she's sweet like 5 stars
I gotta get it right now
I'm kinda hungry 'bout to hit five guys, pause
Sike nah, I'm just fucking around
Let me get it no beef
Nah, we squash that, this is how we do it
We 'bout the lettuce we toss that, uh goddamn
It's so crazy such a, particular case
My man Louie G looking like he just came back from outer space
It's just much more than a hare race, you're moving at a snail's pace
Goddamn I'm just switching the flow
Never know, half white, half negro
You know we gotta spit it that's for sure
I love who I am, love who I ain't
This is how we do it, let me spit it
Just let me paint, the picture, the second I get richer, I get bigger
Can you feel it, the second I got it, I got six figures and commas
I never pause though, unless I need it, this is how we do it
That's, word to Anita, we, need to bring it back
I love the beat let's go again
Let's go again, let's go again, come on

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Let me spit it like this it's, so ridiculous
Goddamn I know you feel it
Wu-Tang, hit you with the killer B
Goddamn that's my thing when I spit it when I sing
Oh my God, going crazy, it never does amaze me
Never lazy when I spit it off the top
The topic is hella awesome
Yo, it's like freestyle, the art of a rhyme
The second I spit it, in my mind I design, I
Bring it back, I might say some of the things twice
Or three times in a row, but it doesn't matter that's for sure
We just having a good time
The second I rhyme, I spit it divine
Goddamn, it's so crazy it's off the top of my mind
I'm from Maryland how many times must I say it
I spray it, never delay it, I bring it back like this
Uh, I look around, I see a lot of beautiful people
What's next after Under Pressure, the sequel?
Maybe a prequel, we take it back even before my birth, where Hip Hop started
This is how we do it damn, goddamn
I never farted but this shit's stinking
This is how we do it
Second that I get it you're probably thinking I'm drinking
But I never touch this stuff
Cause the only thing I need to succeed, is this money in my pocket goddamn
Wanted to greed, unless we want to talk gluttony
And even something else from the seven deadly
How we get it yeah I'm ready, just the medley
I be on, goddamn, it's crazy, this is when I'm going
Goddamn I just feel it, I love it I gotta get it
This is how we do it switch it up, speed it up
Let me get it, that's enough
Goddamn can you feel it can we go
One more time, come on tell 'em let's go
One more time, come on tell 'em let's go
How we go now

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Now this, this right here is the finale
It's never written, that shit is forbidden
Is you kidding you gotta see me now
This is how they do it when they see me yes I smile
All the time, spit it off the top, when I do I rhyme
I gotta keep it going, gotta gotta keep it flowing
I just love it, nothing above it the second I touch it
The second I got it, it's ever enough
I'm like a human dictionary, paint pictures like pictionary
It's hella scary these motherfuckers think that they can see me
But I see right through y'all
See I see the bigger picture like I work at the movies
These motherfucking groupies wanna get next to me
I'm like nah bitch, don't touch me, you need to understand
I'm an actually, I'm a nice guy so, I don't fuck with hoes
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm all about my money all about this shit
All about my team, all about the hits
This is what I gotta do, this shit is legendary, it's never scary
The second I spit it, it's what?
It's like an obituary
What I'm spitting isn't written cause I murder you motherfuckers off the top
This is how we do it, yeah I bring the ruckus
I'm a good motherfucker and I represent Hip Hop
So all this other extra bullshit, please stop
This is who I am, I am just a man, I am, who I am
Motherfucker that's me

Come on baby girl, tell me how you feel, let me get it, let me get it
Let me get it, let me get it, can you feel it?
I'm just loving it, loving it
Bring it, bring it right back, this is hella cazy
Maybe half on the sack, used to smoke a little tree, back in tenth grade
Honeys, honeys, I could never evade
I was just skipping school, breaking all the rules, coming from a broken home
Felt like I was, I was all alone in, in, all up in a different type of zone
I would close my eyes and then I hit the microphone
Goddamn I was writing in my past, just a young man
It's kinda crazy, I feel like you could just keep going forever, forever, forever-ever?
Like my name was Andre 3k
Goddamn that's what I gotta say
But Imma stop it right here, right now, understand
No other MC could measure, October 21st, it was done, Under Pressure
It's Logic



[Verse]
Uh, I'm ripping and living and striving
The killer, the ripper he calling
Will go with the flow (going and flowing {2})
You know he pursuing it, doing it, moving it, grooving it
Stopping it, rocking it, talking it, walking it
Flip it and rip it
That motherfucker is screwing' it
And everybody to go when
I buy it then break it then roll it
Then look at them
Smoke it then choke all of that later
Pack it, roll it, then lick it
Slicing MCs like Darth Vader
Decapitate a hater
The second I spit it 'cause I'm winning now
I gotta get it like that y'all
I gotta get it like that y'all
// OR
It's like that y'all
It's like that
// OR
Lemme hear you say "Hell yeah!"



[Intro]
Shout out Mos Def, all day

Y'all know the deal we always keep it real, that Rattpack
That's a fact, break a bitch's back
When I get it spit it like crack, doing 70 on this highway
On in front of this bus and bussin' my mind open

And this next piece children, as you know already know, is called "The Plaza"—painted over 300 years ago, back on Earth, by the legendary Sam Spratt, for Logic's third studio album, entitled Everybody. It was released May 5th, 2017.

[GIRL 1:]
Can we go look at it?

[GUIDE:]
Yeah!

[GIRL 2:]
It's so beautiful!

[GUIDE]
(to GIRL 2)
It is beautiful...
(to GIRL 3)
Yep?

[GIRL 3:]
Is that how people looked back then?

[GUIDE:]
That is how people looked back then, yes! Back in the day there were different creeds, nationalities, colors—but, it's all different now...



[Intro: Rhetorik]
What up y'all, welcome to 106 & Park BET Backroom
My name is Rhetorik, out here for Visionary Music Group
One time for the Rattpack
Ayo Logic, think it's about time you wake these people up!

[Verse 1]
For my real homies that hold me down
Thanks to y'all they can't hold me down
Seem like everybody know me now like I owe 'em something
They've been around
Bitch I've been the same, y'all know the name
Never let the fame affect the game
When you do that shit through, give a fuck about what you've been through

[Hook]
Money change people that's right it change people not me
Seems like the only people my money change is the people not around me
Seem like my phone going crazy, like I'm just never free
It seem like my whole life they wanted me to be something not me

[Verse 2]
Let's get it
Women they love it put nothing above it I'm married to this shit I could never covet
I know that I'm living this life I was given I've been made for this shit
Beautiful women I love 'em, I do
I could never put 'em over my crew
5 in the morning now she coming through
Hollywood hills yeah she's loving the view

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've seen more dark nights than Bruce Wayne
Been through it all but I overcame
I'm still the same ain't nothing change, wait
Wait now I got a little more change
Do the shit cause I feel like it
They thought about it I real lifed it
Ain't nobody got a deal like it
Drop the shit and they real like it goddamn yeah uh
Take a step back let me analyse, I'm the man yeah uh
I'm draped up and I'm dripped at and I'm staying here
Rattpack 'til my pulse flat it's the brain yeah
Shit hot, then I'm probably on it
Like a desktop, I'm iconic
It's Logic



[Logic]
Lyrically I murder you quicker than Lamborghini drive-bys
Who knew one man could handle more beef than Five Guys
Sharper than steak knives, that I used to break ties
West Deer Park, that's where I'm from, end of story
Where cats pack more MACs than Apple's inventory
Maryland on my back, never slack, get the glory
I'm a motherfucking lyricist bitches they fearing us
Back in the day, they wasn't hearing this
Now I'm the one who's steering this, I'm self-driven
Will he kill it? That's a lyrical given
New-School style, but the 90's is where my lyrics living
My flow is like another Earth, second nature
I'll disintegrate ya', migrate ya', then light-saber, decapitate ya'
In the beginning they said I was fabricated
As soon as the numbers escalated, but these fuckers just mad that I made it
More chains than when a slave's traded, check it
I'm under MC's skin, like muscle tissue, what's the issue?
If you talking shit then Imma hit you
Grab that pistol and whip you then dip you in lava, ain't no one 'liver
Second I arrive I murder it, I know you never heard of it
So sick, my lyrics I don't spit I regurgitate 'em
As listeners, chronologically study my words verbatim
Assassinate 'em, the second I raid 'em like five-O
We pull off the heist and flee to cabo, uh
I mask emotions like a robbery
Cause when it comes to matters of the heart women will clog your arteries
This reality, kill it and you're dead like a fatality
Haters wanna kill me I should put 'em on a salary and give 'em their own hotline to talk shit
Call it 1-8-0-0 Suck my Dick
Wu-Tang forever mothotherfucker what I'm reppin'
The second I step in the vicinity murder evil entities
Who pretend to be friends of me but I know they not
[?] that's what I got, catch me in the spot
Never getting caught, never getting shot
Know we love it one love [?]
Unless it's from the cops then out body drops ha!
Of course I'm speaking metaphorical
Prophesizing the future like the oracle
Flow is rethorical the shit's historical
But they don't understand me I'm staying now
I getting honeys wiser than Christopher Colombus
While the youth's listening to music that make them the dumbest
Kamasutra flow, motherfuckers already know
My position is on top, your position is fetal
Never vain like a needle 'less I'm on the mic damn right
Hand me the mic and I'm the cockiest ever [?] motherfucker that you've ever met
But after the set
I'm humble, ready to rumble no we never stumble cause we 'bout it
Before I dropped my last shit everybody doubted
Till it came out, spit the flame out, and got my name out
Cause I'm ripping it up in a way that ain't nobody heard of it
Totally original but you ain't heard a word of it
All you do is compare me to others cause you're scared of it
So every category that you put me in I murder it
Murder it brutally, who are you to me, what could you do to me
To make me stop telling people to follow their dreams
Cause in the world we livin' everything it ain't all as it seems
But, if I can make ain't no reason they can't do the same
So if you ain't happy then you're the one to blame
[?] persevere till these haters fearing your name
Life is a vicious game [?] both pleasure and pain
But you only get one shot so boy, you better aim
Rattpack, Wu-Tang, forever what I claim



[Verse 1]
Laced up face up about to get it right
We ain't giving up the W without a fight
What you know about Friday Night lights
With an eagle so we about to take flight
Only one goal, never lose sight
Step on the court, we ignite
All the fans in the stands that are here tonight
To watch us when rocking the purple and white
Gonzaga is connected, you know we stay with net
And as for Nate Britts' plays, his J's stay wet
We got pros and they ain't even in college yet
What we think of the competition they ain't even a threat

[Hook]
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it

[Verse 2]
All day, all night yeah we get it in
So there ain't no way that we giving in
Do it for the love not for the dividend
Cause we all got passion and discipline
When we in the paint, we mob 'em
Big ben, he swats 'em
Kris Jenkins is a problem
Just ask Snoop we dog 'em
You know we the center of attention
5 time champs not to mention
Winning games in every dimension
Breakin' ankles till we bench 'em
Jay Jones used to replenish 'em
Now he take score while we diminish 'em
Colleague in my league be dissin him
Dj and O we finish 'em

[Hook]
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it

[Verse 3]
See this is basketball, half of y'all
Don't even know how to pass the ball
But I master y'all with these lyrics
Step to the mic and I know that you fear it
This is my dream, me and this team
Can't relate homie you know what I mean
Cause I got passion, they got heart
We were destined from the start
To rip it apart, never depart
Quickly climbing up the charts
So we gon' last, watch us dash
Whip the competition's ass

[Hook]
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
We ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin
We ballin and we ain't gon stop
Gonzaga, Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, hunnid, we run it
Gonzaga, keep it one hunnid, homie you know we run it
(Logic)



[Verse 1]
Oh my my
Oh how the times have changed and I know why
Things will never be the same again
Things will never be the same
Never be the same

[Chorus]
And oh, it's 'cause the world has changed
And oh, the world has changed
The world has changed

[Bridge]
Even in your darkest of times
Just remember everybody falls apart sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

[Outro]
And oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



[Verse 1]
Going so you know I'm trying to get it
Eyes on the prize like I really want to hit it
Mind on my money, money on mind like a fitted
Give me the mic and you know Imma spit it
This is hot you call me Logic rising to the top just watch it
Now I'm in the rap game but this still the same
Got to grind, bring fame to my name
Wake up go to work come home write
I'd rather be rapping on stage every night
Perfecting that craft and getting it right
Solo? No I think that's tight
I've been waiting in line at the D.M.V
But now it's time that you've heard of me
Cutting lines they want to murder me
Cause I'm rising to the top quickly
I'm so ill they sick of me
Said I'm so ill they sick of me
My etiquette sick, predicate sick
So infectious I make medicine sick
I got it on lock, will never stop
Got y'all addicted like Rick is to rock
I'm ready to bang, doing my thing
Y'all Tyrone Biggums, my music the cane
Taking over the game
With each and every set
Your career is in jeopardy and I'm Alex Trebek
I'll drop a track that'll murder your whole camp for fun
I'm young Elroy, fly like a jet, son

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Live with the mic I grip it
Man I dare you to try to come pick it
Always on point so you never gon' get it
Got rhymes for days the flow infinite
I, kill the club when I'm in it
Rocking the game I am cemented
I produce the real, they counterfeit it
Setting it off like Jada Pinkett
Yeah my, lyrics is hot but the flow hydrate you like liquid
If y'all hands in the vault I'll flip it
Y'all gon' need jars in the game, never sip it
Got it on lock when I walk with you shippin'
Yeah I got shoes to fill but I can fit 'em
Call me the master sergeant I drill'em (drill'em)
Full Metal Jacket I kill'em (kill'em)
I'm secured like A.D.T
Y'all distracted like A.D.D
Y'all ain't touching my self esteem I hold keys like Mediene
Young thriller I'mma beat'em
Haters know I don't need'em
Cause Logic get nasty, on my Jeffrey Dahmer I eat 'em
Go back and check a second time
Be sure and frisk it
So many hot lines encrypted you probably just missed it
I flow narcissistic and keep a mirror in your booth
Even I can't believe I'm saying this shit I needed proof



[Intro]
(Look at this nigga, little bitch can't rap
You white! Motherfucking bullshit
Fuck outta' here with that shit)

[Verse 1]
Baby you got me confused, with one of them other dudes
Under they breath mumblin', shout out to Spitta I'm crumblin'
All these haters that want it homie I keep it a hundred
Never fronted while you stunting acting like you hate it but really want it
I swear to god when they talkin' shit it just make me smile
Cause you ain't no hater my brotha' just a fan in denial
Every time that you hate on me I get stronger when risen
Judgin' these lyrics by my skin homie that's racism
My momma white my daddy black but ya'll don't even listen
Judgin' by only what you see that's artistic division
And in the end creates an intellectual collision
But if you listen to my words then you would see my vision
But that's enough on that subject homie I'mma keep flowin'
On the tour bus, four of us, the weed's blowin'
But I ain't smokin', I'm just writin' while homies tokin'
Playin' this game until that shit is broken
Fuckin' with honeys 'til they panties soakin'
Feelin' victorious, hella glorious, my story is gonna be depicted by
Me and my team as warriors that did it big like Notorious
Haters talkin' shit gon' get the goriest of verses

(Yo, that shit is whack yo)
Man what the, maaaaaan that shit was weak yo what the fuck was he talkin' about, everything he said made sense
Maaaaan, that's some bullshit
I mean, I mean you can't say much you know what I mean like yeah he spit you know what I'm sayin' like
His lyrics is good and you know, he kill it with the flow but, man that shit sucked though, yuh)

As listeners chronologically study my words, verbatim
Assassinate em’, the second I raid em’ like five-0
We pull off the heist and flee to Cabo now
I mask emotions like a robbery, cause when it comes to matters of the heart
Women will clog your arteries
Rattpack, V’s up – Visionary

[Verse 2: Mikkey Halsted]
See the truth through the eyes of the childen that’s born in poverty
Where their chances of breaking that cycle is like the lottery
Not about black and white – you’re rich or you’re poor
So the poor trying to get rich till they stiff in the morgue
I’m the embodiment of ‘real’, I body niggers with skill
If I up it Ima’ bust it, somebody bout’ to get killed
Smoke em’ like Black and Milds, bringing lyrics back in style
These suckers don’t want to battle, they ducking like Pacquiao
8 blocks of bodies, I’m ahead by a mile
Sucker thought he could rap, I fuck up nigga’s morale
I got the clarity of Jay, the complexity of Nas, Lines like Big L, I go against all odds
Like Pac did, I pop shit with the best of them
They got to much estrogen to F’ with him
Ima’ changa like the nephilim
I flood the market till there’s no more left of them like the days of Noah
I split the brick and dip my blade in coka
Take a sniff and see there’s nothing doper
This Coke-eighty shit, they soft as baby shit, pussy as chocha
They better deuce before the whole world smell the aroma
Listen, I want it all, Charlie I’m born to ball
Im the machine-gun preacher and this is my alter call... Bang!
Im the machine-gun preacher and this is my alter call... Bang!



Is it so hard, to be a good person
Tell me is it really so hard, really so hard
To stop acting like a bitch (Woo!)
I treated everybody with respect and now i'm rich (Woo!)
I treated everybody with respect -



[Intro]
Psychological!
Damn right
Have you ever heard Psychological spit a verse son?
It's quite crazy
It's quite crazy son
Damn right!

[Verse 1]
Some walk a vine line
I sip fine wine
Rhyme ahead of my time
A fetus with a wise mind
Now you know it's on
Hungry like Ramadan
And mothefuckers I ain't leaving 'til the plate's gone
I thought you knew
Lactose intolerant fool
Don't eat cheddar but my wallet do
This is how a scholar do
Phenomenal, I affect like domino
Rolling through like Geronimo
I'm hungry like a third world diet
80 sets a day send it my way
I'm viral, infectious
My state of mind is, bigger than Texas
I wrote this rhyme in my phone where the text is
Cause I ran out of paper if that they hungry I don't know what is

[Outro]
Psychological, you know what that means y'all?
That means he is in your head for sure



[Man]
Look, I know there have been a lot of mistakes
And we both made them
I apologize for my part in that
And all that said, nonsense in the past
I don't give a shit about that anymore

[Woman]
You always want what you want when you want it
Why is everything so urgent with you?

[Man]
Let me tell you something
This here, right now, at this very moment
That's all that matters to me
That's urgent like a motherfucker



I administer sinister verses
Ain't no father to my style, bitch I birthed this
The menace is like Dennis
From Maryland to Venice
Like a chemist in a lab
Ha, my shit is complex and y'all the tenant
Ey yo who's arm is this ?
I guess Slim cut it off at the pharmacist
We murderin' MCs and then flee to wherever the Bahamas is
I blew up, So that's to let y'all know who the Bombest is
Cause I can see the future like my glasses Nostradamus's
Damn these rappers and they feelings
Like an orthodontist
It's probably cause my skin is white
Come on, be more than honest
I signed a deal with Def Jam
Cause I'm the man
You motherfuckers are sorta's and kinda's

(2x)
Yeah my city behind this
I know that you see that I'm murdering synonyms all up in them when I rhyme this
My flow is impeccable, hella unwreckable
Knowing nobody else honest

Now let me slow it down
So you ignorant people hear me
Even my favorite MC's won't get near me cause they fear me
Revere me, no disrespect. I mean that shit sincerely
I am merely the 2nd Renaissance to the fullest
It's all love from up above
Keep a gat in the glove just in case
Introduce you to Christ like Mase, sike nah!
All of you know that Logic keep the peace
But my brothers keep a piece in the streets, You got it? Capisce?
See that's a life I never wanted but I grew up in
And did a lot of dumb shit I'd never do again, What!



[Nakarat]
Son zamanlarda sessizdim
Zamanımı değerlendiriyorum
Aklımı kaçırmışım gibi hissediyorum
Hayatım benim değilmiş gibi hissediyorum
Kimi ilgilendirir?

Yaşamak istemiyorum
Yaşamak istemiyorum
Bugün sadece ölmek istiyorum, sadece ölmek istiyorum
Yaşamak istemiyorum
Yaşamak istemiyorum, izin ver de nedenini açıklayayım

[Verse 1]
Hakkında konuştuğum şeyler hakkında bir şey bildiklerini sanıyorlar
Birinin beni kurtarması için dua ediyordum, kimse kahraman değil
Hayatımın bir değeri yok, biliyorum, biliyorum
İçim acıyor ancak bunu gösteremiyorum
Bana ait diyebileceğim bir yerim olmadı
Hiç evim olmadı, kimse beni aramadı
"Neredeydin, neredesin, aklında ne var?"
Tüm hayatların değerli olduğunu söylerler ancak benimkini kimse umursamadı

[Nakarat]
Son zamanlarda sessizdim
Zamanımı değerlendiriyorum
Aklımı kaçırmışım gibi hissediyorum
Hayatım benim değilmiş gibi hissediyorum
Kimi ilgilendirir?

Yaşamanı istiyorum, yaşamanı istiyorum
Bugün ölmek zorunda değilsin, ölmek zorunda değilsin
Yaşamanı istiyorum, yaşamanı istiyorum
Ölmek zorunda değilsin, izin ver de nedenini açıklayayım

[Alessia Cara]
Kafan suda boğulurken aldığın ilk nefes
Sevdiğin ile göğüs göğüseyken havada dolanan o rahatlık
Yollar uzun olsa da devam ediyor ve en karanlık şeylerde bile ışığı görüyor
Kendi yansımana baktığın zaman kim olduğunu biliyorsun, bunun için tanrıya teşekkür edeceğini biliyorum

[Verse 2]
Neredeydin, neredesin, nereye gidiyorsun biliyorum
Hayata inanma sebebimin sen olduğunu biliyorum
Minik bir gece olmadan gündüzün anlamı ne ki?
Sadece minik bir ışık yakmaya çalışıyorum
Zor olabilir
Çok zor olabilir
Ancak şu an yaşamak zorundasın, feda edebileceğin her şeyin var şu an

Son zamanlarda sessizdim
Zamanımı değerlendiriyorum
Aklımı kaçırmışım gibi hissediyorum
Hayatım benim değilmiş gibi hissediyorum
Kimi ilgilendirir?

Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Bugün ölmek istemiyorum, ölmek istemiyorum
Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Ölmek istemiyorum
Ölmek istemiyorum

[Khalid]
Acılar aynı şekilde can yakmıyor, biliyorum
Gittiğim yol yalnız hissettiriyor
Ancak bacaklarım pes edene kadar devam edeceğim
Gözyaşlarımın karlar içinde eridiğini görüyorum
Ağlamak istemiyorum, daha fazla ağlamak istemiyorum
Canlı hissetmek istiyorum, artık ölmek bile istemiyorum
İstemiyorum, istemiyorum
Artık ölmek bile istemiyorum



[Pré-refrain: Logic]
J'étais sur le bas côté
Je prenais mon temps
Je me sens comme hors de moi
Comme si cette vie n'était pas pour moi
Qui peut s'y rapporter?
J'étais sur le bas côté
Je prenais mon temps
Je me sens comme hors de moi
Comme si cette vie n'était pas pour moi
Qui peut s'y rapporter?

[Refrain: Logic]
Je ne veux pas être en vie
Je ne veux pas être en vie
Je veux juste mourir aujourd'hui
Je veux juste mourir
Je ne veux pas être en vie
Je ne veux pas être en vie
Je veux juste mourir
Et laisse-moi te dire pourquoi

[Couplet 1: Logic]
Toute cette autre merde à propos de laquelle je parle, ils pensent qu'ils connaissent
Je priais pour que quelqu'un me sauve, personne n'est héroïque
Et ma vie ne compte même pas
Je le sais, je le sais, je sais que je suis profondément blessé mais je ne peux le montrer
Je n'ai jamais eu d'endroit pour être moi-même
Je n'ai jamais eu de maison
Personne n'appelait mon portable
Où étais-tu? Où es-tu? A quoi penses-tu?
Ils disent que toutes vies sont précieuses mais personne ne s'inquiète pour la mienne

[Pré-refrain: Logic]
J'étais sur le bas côté
Je prenais mon temps
Je me sens comme hors de moi
Comme si cette vie n'était pas pour moi
Qui peut s'y rapporter?
J'étais sur le bas côté
Je prenais mon temps
Je me sens comme hors de moi
Comme si cette vie n'était pas pour moi
Qui peut s'y rapporter?

[Refrain: Logic]
Je veux que tu sois en vie
Je veux que tu sois en vie
Tu ne mourras pas aujourd'hui
Tu ne vas pas mourir
Je veux que tu sois en vie
Je veux que tu sois en vie
Tu ne vas pas mourir
Et laisse-moi te dire pourquoi

[Couplet 2: Alessia Cara]
C'est le vrai premier souffle
Quand ta tête était noyée sous l'eau
Et c'est la clarté dans les airs
Quand tu es là-bas
L'un contre l'autre avec un amant
Cela tient debout, même si la route est longue
Et voyant la lumière dans les choses ténébreuses
Et lorsque tu fixes ton reflet
Sachant finalement de qui il s'agit
Je sais que tu remercieras Dieu pour l'avoir fait

[Couplet 3: Logic]
Je sais où tu étais, où tu es, où tu vas
Je sais que tu es la raison pour laquelle je crois en la vie
Qu'est-ce qu'une journée sans un peu de nuit?
J'essaie juste de verser un peu de lumière
Ça peut être dur
Ça peut être si dur
Mais tu vas vivre maintenant
Tu as tout à donner maintenant

[Pré-refrain: Logic]
J'étais sur le bas côté
Je prenais mon temps
Je me sens comme hors de moi
Comme si cette vie n'était pas pour moi
Qui peut s'y rapporter?
J'étais sur le bas côté
Je prenais mon temps
Je me sens comme hors de moi
Comme si cette vie n'était pas pour moi
Qui peut s'y rapporter?

[Refrain: Logic]
Je veux finalement être en vie
Je veux finalement être en vie
Je ne veux pas mourir aujourd'hui
Je ne veux pas mourir
Je veux finalement être en vie
Je veux finalement être en vie
Je ne veux pas mourir
Je ne veux pas mourir

[Outro: Khalid]
La douleur ne fait pas souffrir de la même manière, je sais
La voie que je traverse donne la sensation de solitude
Mais je bouge jusqu'à ce que mes jambes lâchent
Et vois mes larmes fondre dans la neige
Mais je ne veux pas pleurer
Je ne veux plus pleurer
Je veux me sentir en vie
Je ne veux plus avoir envie de mourir
Oh, je ne veux plus
Je ne veux plus
Je ne veux avoir envie de mourir



I don't know what I'mma do
I don't know where I'mma live
'Cause I feel like I ain't got nothin' to give
That's why I follow my dreams
That's why I follow my heart
But the world wanna tear me apart
Right from the start
Everything I ever wanted
It ain't what it thought
Bring it back to the roots like my name Black Thought
This shit right here, no it can't be taught
It gotta' be learned, it gotta' be earned



[Intro]
I mean man are you serious man? You opened up for PittBull, EPMD, Method Man, Redman, and Ludacris?
Man get the fuck out of here, man I know you lying

Dog, I'm telling you the truth man, look, I came on stage and he was like "He goes by the name of Psychological. Alright, lyrics. give it up for Psychological. Jigga what?

Uh, D.C., Maryland, Virginia make some noise!
Nah, nah, nah, y'all sound dead to me. I said make some noise!

[Hook]
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some-

[Verse 1]
Back stage, palms sweaty but I'm ready
To kill my say, you know I gotta get the credy
Moments before yeah im feelin' unsure but everybody like "You dope man we've seen you before"
Gotta stay humble, mind state ready to rumble
Gotta keep my cool in this concrete jungle
Moments before and Im still feelin' nervous
Roots walkin' up like "Whats good you ever heard us?" (Man)
Nah homie, you see I'm kinda in the zone
We can talk later but for now leave me alone
Then the M.C. for the whole event
Comes up to me while I'm chillin' in the tent
Said "I know you hungry, today you gonna eat, but first theres a couple guys I want you to meet" (Whats up?)
Took me on the tour bus told me "Have a seat"
Then a moment later, I met a few from Wu-Tang
It was surreal cause they the reason I'm in the game

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Off of the bus, gunnin' ready to bust
Rhyme is a must, finna kill it you better trust
My heary poundin', but calm and collected is how I'm soundin'
Dressed fresh to death go all the honeys drownin'
Grip the mic while the announce my name
Small talk backstage with big names in the game
See I, know the line, between Logic and Bobby
See Bobby, he listen to rap for a hobby
But Logic, sit back relax he ain't go shit
So while the other acts, askin' for autographs
I'm as professional as it gets ain't no need to ask
Why you goin' up to them, talkin' bout you rap
How you this how you that, then like "hey, can you sign that?"(Please)
I'm on the stage and they like "I wanna sign that"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Off of the stage, the whole crowd feelin' me
Copies of the mixtape what they wanna be
See I ain't never ever seen a concert
But the first one that I went to is the first one that I merked
When I first came on, they wasn't showin' love
When I last stepped off every girl wanted a hug (Haha)

[Outro]
I mean yeah man
It was a real cool experience, you know?
Its the first time I ever really did something that big, you know?
With a few thousand people there and everything
And, I mean it was just tight, you know what I mean?
So, its pretty, its pretty much what I got out of it
Yeah



Imma let it drop this time
Yea

[Verse 1]
Psycho whats fearless, anti-slits that means I'm illest
No bitch on my blood so I qualify as the realest
Infinite my mental capacity, ain't no passing me
A mastery with more verses than the first testament
Sacrifice a week, MC's that's how I do repent
C4, I'll disintegrate your friend to see more
Suicide lyricist, hit you like a claymore
My sixth sense leave you to burn like a pack of incense
Flow intense, filled with mad suspense
As I drench your headphones, proclaim my throne
Switch up the style quick to invert the tone

Yo, ha, yo

[Verse 2]
My mentality decipher reality for pretend
My state of mind is forcing fools to bend
Can you comprehend from where I do descend
My minds made up [?], my philosophy a zealous prophecy
Let me teach you this hypocrisy
I'm an assassin with the name of a Kennedy
But truly you can't kill my identity
Sway with the miracle known as lyrical melody
Coming with brutality, finish with a fatality
Listen, I'm the illest white boy on the M-I-C
Reside in MD
Right around the corner from DC
In my spare time, I write rhymes in three
What's the dealio?
Sharp like Number 24s free throw
Playing Bitches like [?] shit
Cause you know I need dough
Never pack heat [?]
I never sleep, less it be around the police
Spit projectiles, rugged exterior like a reptile
I never met an MC that could truly amaze me
Yeah they bust shots, but they bullets only graze me
A mental institution, I probably need to be in it
Cause I ain't done 'till I'm done and the song finished
This the type of shit that you bump with your windows tinted
This the type of shit that you bump with your fingers lifted
Spit the illest, I grab the microphone so you can feel this
Give you the realest, c'mon you know the deal is
Ever since I started rapping, real shit begun to happen
Brainwave frequencies I'm tapping
My first show, standing ovation, they still clapping
Showcases of governmental facilities
They was feeling me, dictionary my only utility
My flow heavier than menstruation
Leave the whole club shocked cause my skin Caucasian
Amazing, sharper than a sword by an Asian
Rhymes I release through my rugged fingertips
Keep a 9 to 5 only 'till I get rich
Cause I gotta hold a job, or I'll feel like a bitch
I murder mics, wordplay nice, heart made of ice
Any publicity good publicity, right?
So if my name in ya mouth, then I'm spreading like lice
I'm too nice

Drop it



[Verse]
Uh, uh, uh
I run game like a sony
The original mac pro sue apple yeah they owe me
I'm real like I Mac you boot leg phony
The center of attention but you at the cypher lonely
When I step up on the stage everybody getting loud
Call me double 007 cause I bond with the crowd
Say he rhyming with the rest of 'em
Up there with the best of 'em
No style can compare like Marc Jacobs addressing 'em
Inside the booth that’s my only safe haven
Flyer than a 747 out of Reagan
Ha, I keep the flow abstract
Keep the toast close to my six pack so im ab strapped
Nah, but it sounded tight right (Right, right, right)
Yeah, I said this buzz I'm creating is light years ahead
To infinite and beyond my shit is bomb
Like Al Qaeda carry on
You want beef I'll give it to you classy like filet mignon motherfucker
Ha yeah, yo shit is vary like a military commissary
Oh my bad I mean cheesy cause your vocab it varies
Give me the mic and you know I'ma fucking smash this
I want my record in constant rotation like the earths axis
Never need to tighten up my game I spit ratchets
I'm David Blain you bammers is hat tricks
I'm a somersault off the boat you just a back flip
Any competitor whatever come face me
Homie im already straight you can't brace me
Yeah, I keep my cool like AC
That franchise flow you know we spread like Macy's
Any style, any pace I can flow it all
Getting brain in the booth I'ma know it all
You bleeding right through yo face homie yes, you show it all
I got that vi la Vida poker face I don’t show at all
This is maturity homie but you don’t grow at all
Pretends the fans minds is money I blow it all
Y'all slipping falling y'all can't get up
Call me Drake's ACL, I tear shit up
No disrespect homie
Nothing intended this is wordplay only
Never synthetic I keep it real never keep it phony
Stand out like blue jeans on the red carpet before the tonies
It ain't over till the fat lady sing and I got that bitch gagged
I been red flagged by these posers that brag
Im Comcast they fios
I study they bios
So if we beef I have the upper hand on all my rivals
This is just a bit of lyricism for your mind
Encrypted like Egyptian hieroglyphics and rewind
And listen to the punchlines divine to blow ya fucking mind
Enjoy yourselves



[Verse]
Shorty, she love it
The second I rub it
There's nothing above it
Less' we talking music
That's the only time I covet
Latina honey took me to the casa
I ain't lying, I killed the pussy like Mufasa
Never impostor, she light the blunt up like a Rasta
Put on her clothes, now we headed out to dinner, dinner eating Shrimp and Lobster
Unless I'm mobbing with the Rattpack, then we scarfing pasta
I prophesize the future like i'm Nostra-damus
Never cocky, I'm honest, spitting the bombest
At the party, swimming in the sea of women while they spin Ebonics
Murder the game at light speed like Sega Sonic
Look white but spit black cause' me mixed like a Gin and Tonic
Shorty, she love it thuggish
Of course that's hella' rugged
And now you know we blowin' up like Middle-Eastern luggage
Yeah, we live life and do it proper
From MD to NYC, whipping the Phantom to the Opera



[Intro]
I don't want any bologna, magic tricks, or psychological mumbo jumbo

In psychological terms

[Verse 1: Logic]
Never stopping it, continuously dropping it
And if you a chicken I grab the heat and start cocking it
And cowardice a thousand deaths
So only one time is how many times that imma' take my last breath
Feel my flow like you blind like you blind I'm not deaf
And if you do me foul, imma' call you out like a ref'
I love the way the snare hit and the drum kick like a fetus
All we need now is some punch lines to complete this
I sewed the lines I ripped let me read this
I sewed the lines I ripped let me read this
I'm wellaware
Homie I'm wella-wellaware
Said I'm wellaware
Homie I'm-Homie I'm wellaware

[Dialogue: Logic]
I am well aware of the path that I have chosen in the hip-hop community
And I am also well aware that if I keep up with myself at the pace I'm going, beautiful things can happen

[Hook: Logic]
I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man
Said I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man

[Verse 2: Logic]
The peacekeepers hit me up so you know I had to rock it for 'em
Wellaware hit me up inside to rap for him
He's in the U.K
I'm in the U.S.A
But that don't matter we collaboratin' anyway
I'm wellaware that rhyming is my affair
I'm on some wellaware that I spit shit you wouldn't dare
And guarantee a rise from an underground lair
Said I'm wellaware
My odds is a million to one
But I get it done
And while I'm mad I might have some fun
Yes I'm wellaware
That the people support my music
And I'm wellaware
That when haters listen they lose it
Allow me to intensify the situation
I'm an original artist but most of these fakers is tracing
Now watch me get in the rack with the track and smack back
I can't mess with stuff that just don't mix
Like rappers that be spittin' 'bout nothing but stupid hits
Fuck around and I break you down to the nucleus
It's Psychological well aware that we in the mix
Generate killer hits while the snare break you to bits
You probably think he sampled Nike with them fresh kicks
Punch lines like that got bitches on my dick
It's punch lines like that got bitches on my
Yo it's punch lines like that got bitches on my dick
Sorry I'm kind of sick

[Dialogue: Big Lenbo]
This music
I just feel this music
This music you know comes from the heart
It's creative
It's really inspiring to me

[Hook]
Said I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man

[Dialogue: Logic]
Well I mean
Definitely first and foremost you know I just wanna' give a shoutout to the producer of this track
Cause without him you know this whole concept wouldn't have really been done
You know I wouldn't have thought about it
It wouldn't have came to me so definitely you know thank-thank you though for letting me hear this shit and put it together and just-and just think about it you know what I mean
And it's such a good way to produce yourself and it was a good concept you know so I really enjoyed it man
We gonna' keep giving it to 'em

[Hook]
I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man
Said I'm wellaware, well well where I'm going
Yes I'm wellaware, well well what I'm doing
Yes I'm wellaware, well well who I am
Yes I'm wellaware, wellaware that I'm the man

[Outro]
Wellaware
Wellaware
Wellaware
Wellaware
Wellaware
Wellaware



LOGIC: It's a lyric in a song, not gonna say what song, where or what, this that. But what I was saying in the original song, I was trying to talk about my experience at Lollapalooza. So when I was on my stage, a whole sea of people came through at Chicago and it was 50,000 people in the crowd, and I got a line that goes:
"Check the Instagram fam
I got fifty-thousand people in the crowd, singin' out loud
Every word, that's every lyric
You can hate, just stop actin' like you don't hear it"And, for me, when I was in the booth, I trying to think of different cool ways to say "fifty-thousand", so I was like "fifty-thousand people" and I was like "five-o-triple-o people done it" and I was trying to flow, right? But I couldn't find it, so I just ended up going with "I got fifty thousand people in the crowd". But at the very end of the song, it said "five-o-triple-o" at the end and it sounded like a really cool tag, just like a dope kinda like production tag and so I left that on a couple of songs that I had, and it kinda made it on "Flexicution". I won't talk about that, so...hahaha.

[Chorus]
And the night goes
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on



[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, let me [?]
What's the deal? Keep it real
'Bout to spit that mass appeal
What's the flavor, I'm your savior
'Bout to come, I feel the vibe
This is how we do it
Can you feel it comin' through the tribe?

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Uh, can you feel it? Man, I'm feelin' live
Any time I come up on the mic I spit a vibe
It's the feelin' that's inside that's in the song
And I feel it 'cause it's like liquid gold
You know I gotta get it and
It's a fire in my spirit, man
You gotta hear it and you never live it
And I spit the clearest
See my future clearer through the crystal ball
Niggas know I gotta never let this shit fall
I gotta…

[Verse 3: Logic]
I'm 'bout to… I'm 'bout to break up in this shit one time
I gots to murder the rhyme 'cause this shit is so divine
Can you feel this vibe? I am alive
And this is how I'm feelin', hella good
Rollin' through my hood, smokin' on that Backwood

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, we are alive, it's the best feelin'
I can't describe, it's just the way I'm wheelin' and I'm dealin'
And you see it, man I got it, through the roof, it's through the ceilin'
It's one hell of a feelin' for your teeth and Dr. Phillin'
And I'm good, uh

[Verse 5: Logic]
Up through the ceilin', it's a feelin', and I'm comin' rippin' rhymes
The second I spit it, I got it, I rip it all the time
L-O-G-I-C and Bada$$, that's how we get down
You know west side, we get down
Especially when we're rollin' through your town

[Verse 6: Joey Bada$$]
You say that's how we get down
Check the app, Bandsintown
We comin' around
And we got this shit surround sound
We gotta push it down
And we takin' the crowns
We gotta get it, it's the kings of the underground

[Verse 7: Logic]
Ayo, we goin' bar for bar, that's par for par
Everybody know who we are when we step up in the bar
Sippin' on that Scotch…

[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]
And you know, star to star
We got battle scars
And we been through this before, man
We prayin' to the lords, it's the…

[Verse 9: Logic]
Yeah, that's true, when I come through
In a second, what it do?
And this is how we rockin' though, this is how I'm feelin'
Higher than the ceilin'…

[Verse 10: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, you off the scotch and I'm off the wine
We livin' life, we just tryna find
Anything that be divine
I roll the light and you know I got it in mind
Nigga, put a fight…

[Outro: Logic & Joey Bada$$]
And then…I'm fucking lit
Yeah, you know we smokin' a lot, a lot (Aye!)
And my niggas never workin' no nine-to-five
We gotta get it man, thank God, I'm alive
Yo, this beat is crazy
Powers…



[Intro] :
Yo, bare with me. We gonna try and get this joint on the first track. Aight?

[Psychological]:
Hip hop fanatic, my lyrics mathematic
I been chillin' in the attic like Anne Frank
Writing in my journal in front of the whole rank like a colonel
Whenever I'm on the track, guarantee that it's nasty
Hit ya with the steel like Cassey from Degrassi
Yeah, I shut ya down like panic switches
On the green mile, call it the road to riches
Spit fire every time my vocal cord twitches
My high-caliber grammar blow you right out ya britches
Knocking motherfuckers out whenever my knuckle itches
Psychological, but just call me Logic for short, ya mind I contort
Murder MCs for the sport
All I do is get pussy and write - I'm a dork
Flyer than projectiles then vacate the airport
MCs nowadays think it's a rap race
I'm a lyrical back brace - rap I support
Nineteen almost twenty, rappin' to get the money
They see the white boy from Maryland and think it's funny
'Till I slaughter 'em, lyrically manifested, best to get rid of all 'em
Speakin' in the third, he the illest, why they callin' him
Underdog 'till he's top dog, they wanna ball with him
Used to be a nobody, now all the labels callin' him
Why? 'Cause of what the people saw in him
Spit puzzle pieces so guess I'm jig-sawing 'em
Half-white, half-black, that's where I get it, Jack
I kill the beat, then resurrect it back
Just to kill it again, double jeopardy, scot-free
So, if you feel it, fuck with me



[Beat 1: A Tribe Called Quest - Can I Kick It?]
Check, check, check, check, check
Uh come on, come on
We 'bout to get it, 'bout to
We 'bout to get it, check it, check it
You know the deal, always gotta keep it real
Mass appeal from that Tribe Called Quest
Touchin' on your girl breast
Maybe not, I'm a married man
This is how we do it
Can you carry man tell me can you feel it
When I get it, when I spill it, gotta get the vibe
The Incredible True Story yeah
It's kinda gory but the flow is hella whore-y when I get it like this
And this is how we do it uh
You know the flow is hella funny with the swag bunny
Chillin' with the team
This is how we do it Wu-Tang killer with the C.R.E.A.M
Kill a beat, kill a fleet, killer with the free
This is how we do it yes it's L-O-G-I-C
I'm out in L.A
This is how we do it all the time
Miraculous man, miraculous rhyme and I'm
Strictly spittin' this off the top, this how we do it
And this is how we gotta get it
Everybody goin' through it
Just stay motivated, never hate it
And uh...it doesn't matter as long as you escalated
Elevated to another level, word to the Devil
I keep it real, G-O-D, it's all about me
Aside to this, this is how we do it when we rhyme with this
We got more beats?
We got more beats?

[Beat 2:]
Listen, I'm 'bout to do it one more time for your mind
And this is how we do it, spit it, hella divine
Uh, I'm on the incline or rather on the increase
And this is how we do it can you get it like a new species
Word to y'all, y'all flow faeces
This is how we do it when I get it and it's hella crazy
This is random thought, it's just a freestyle
That's how you know it's real
I might repeat myself once or twice but the flow is still nice
When I get it rip it I get it and bringing it back
I never slack, half white half black
I said it once said it twice
Pneumatic device inside my brain, insane
And this is how we do it, never go against the grain
Switch it up, bring another beat on in
Cause this is how we do it and the flow it gon' begin

[Beat 3:]
Come on, come on, check it
I keep goin' and goin'
And this is how we do it
Can you feel it when I spit it, gotta get it, goin' through it
'Bout to bring 'em back that 90's like 1990
When I get it so high, so high like Bone Thugz
When I rip it and get it and like this
And this is how we do it all excite this
I don't even know, this is what I love
I remember watchin' cats like Mos Def freestyle
In the park, after dark, just talkin' random thought
That might not even necessarily..come off the dome like that
But it sounds good, this is how we do it in the hood
And I wish a motherfucker would
On that Yeezy, can ya see me
This is how we do it
I know all these other motherfuckers wanna be me
But it doesn't matter like brain matter when it splatter
And I gotta keep it goin', ass way fatter, yeah
And she..know she love it, the second I get it there's nothing above it
Like this, like that y'all, it's like that y'all
Keep it goin' y'all
So keep it flowin' y'all
Give me another beat now
Come on, give me another beat now, yo, uh, check it

[Beat 4:]
Uh, it's kinda crazy that the album out
It's kinda crazy that the album out, you know
Who know what that boy gon' do first week
But that boy good
They say that boy good
That L-O-G-I-C I bring it back again
I gotta attack again, the second I get it like I'm Maccin' and
This, you know I got it like Akira, the second I got it the spirit is all up in me
On that Cowboy Bebop anime, shoutout to the homie Steve Blum
Where I'm from can I, can you get it, can you come?
Roll through, this is what it really do
I'm just havin' a good time with the rhyme
Uh, we at the radio station, chillin' on the PlayStation
Never hestitating when we got it, uh
Uh, Han Solo on my...Mary Cruz masturbatin', nah
But real talk when we get it, this is how we do it, let me spit it, let me rip it
Let me have a good time with the rhyme with the swag bunny
Flow hella funny and I
I keep goin' over beats on beats on treats on treats, retreat
Never get it when I do it nah
You can never sleep, unless you sleepin' like that Tryptophan
At Thanksgiving, I'm giving, I got it, I'm winning, I'm winning, you know it
This is how we do it nah never dismiss this
One of the illest, artists at Cali Christmas
So come through and understand I'm just a miraculous man
And it's all part of God's plan
The Incredible True Story go get it on the shelf
At Best Buy or Target, I'm not the target
The market, the one, the realest, the killest, you feel this
And this is how we do it right now yes it's Logic

[E-Man]
I'm gonna go on the record by saying that was probably the best Breakfast Bars we've had

[Beat 5: Method Man - Bring the Pain]
Yo what is this Bring the Pain
When I spit it so insane
Gotta bring it back again, never go against the grain
I love it, this is how we do it shoutout to the homie E-Man
He can keep on spinnin'
I'mma be killin' it, spittin' and grinnin'
This is how we do it, take it back to the beginning like that
Oh, when I was back up in the basement
It's kinda crazy, people lookin' at me crazy
Now I wonder where they face went
I sold a couple records and broke a couple records
And now everybody wanna act like
I ain't coming for they neck like a necklace
When I wreck this, never protect this
I'm on that Wu-Tang, kill the beat, kill the game
Said it once, said it twice, yeah
It doesn't matter if I repeat it, rinse, lather, rebead it
When I get it I skeet it all over
And this is how we do it like I'm Jay HOVA, the best
The best, no contest, I gotta get it
I'mma lay it to rest

[Beat 6:]
Oh my God, are we goin' again?
I gotta do it from the top nah lettin' that record spin
It's kinda funny cause I'm not tryna curse in the verse
But fuck all that
Half white can I get it, uh
And I gotta get it like that
It doesn't matter always bring the pain
Always do it hella crazy
This is how we do it can you feel it
Got the fitted on the hat, matter fact it's a snapback, clap back
This is how we do it, never cop that, uh
I ain't even making sense, past tense, present tense
But I'm livin' in the moment
Atonement, the second I got it they want it
But I can never give it to 'em
This is how we do it, live it to 'em
Or rather, better yet I'm livin' with 'em
I'm in it, I get 'em
And if you don't understand it, I demand it
You gotta bring it back again, The Incredible True Story on the shelf
Come on do something for yourself
Go buy yourself a copy, never Carbon
This is how we do it when I'm on and I'm walkin'
I'm never talkin', matter fact I'm talkin'
But I talk the walk, I walk the walk
We preach but we practice
This is how we do it hella crazy and that's it, Logic

[Verse 1: Logic continued]
Now I do the algorithm real slick, real smooth
This is how we do it, like a criminal

Thought I had it for a second but I didn’t
Gotta bring it back

[Dialogue]

Never done ladies and gentlemen!
[Verse 2: Logic]
Ok, I’m ’bout to go again, my flow again
My eyes closed
And this is how we do it when we spit it, do it for the pros
They think they know, but i don’t even think they truly understand
I’m a miraculous man
And this is how we get it, uh
I mix it up, I get it up, I keep my eyes closed
On that second that I got it, these hoes on ’em
I don’t even know just what I’m saying
I ain’t even playing
Mayday, tell me, I gotta get it right, get it tight
[Dialogue]
Oh!
(Big Boy)
We got Logic up in here, ladies and gentlemen!
It is definitely going down here
BIG BOY!



All day (all day), everyday (everyday)
We was on that block until we made a way
Day to day, man that's the only way
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Hook]
Fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Verse 1]
I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kid, gotta get my son back
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Drop into work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'mma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes I'mma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'mma ride in the dead of it yeah
Yeah I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away

[Hook]
Fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Verse 2]
Tell me what a [?] give for a life like this, saw I'm in the lab quite like this
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
So I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention, want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture - no metaphor
I’m being real with ya but it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"
[?] other [?], in a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission but back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life - no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when inside the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'mma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'mma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

[Hook]
Fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away



[Intro: Tim Westwood]
Yo it's Tim Westwood TV
Going back in with my man Logic
From the crib, to Capital Xtra
Let's go fam!

[Logic]
Alright, oh man
I'mma fuck this up, here we go
Check, ch-check, ch-check yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It’s me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cooking like chemists
Take them back to way back when like Dennis, The Menace
Causing mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smoking weed and getting higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that’s in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can’t believe I didn’t get a shorty pregnant
Man, that’s the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
Cause I couldn’t keep it in my briefs, man that’s pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain’t a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can’t prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind
See I’m a self diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
I swear that I got it, yes I got it over here
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here
Check it, s'over here check it, s'over here tougher, s'over here check it
I said tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em up
Play the game, run 'em up
Yeah I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real
Guess that's why Logic appeal
Hold up tell me how that feel, holdie to the
Racism on television and in magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
Check it, yeah, so check it, so check it
I gotta spit it, gotta rip it, I gotta keep it goin'
I'm flowin' strictly off of the top of the dome, they knowin', can I get it?
The L-O-G-I-C I'm reppin' M-D
I said it once I said it twince, I gotta check it yeah
I know something is wrong
I know something is wrong
I know something is wrong
I can tell in this song
I'm feeling hella faded
No I never evade it
The second I get it I spit it, I rip it, I gotta do it yeah
We on and on, we on this Westwood
Feelin' hella good
Jumped across the pond
Word is born when I spit it
Let this motherfucker drop the bomb
Shit is hella crazy, we out in London, where we come from
This is how we do it, get it done yeah and then some
What you call me? They know the name, I gotta spit the game
This is how we do it, Visionary Music Group
All the day, V's up
Plus that Def Jam, I know who I am
I'm the motherfucking man, God damn yes it's Logic
Cool, I'm feeling good with that
Swag



[Verse 1]

I'm ripping and living and striving and killing

The ripper he rolling never going

He flowing he pursuing it doing it moving it grooving it

Stopping it talking it walking it

Flip it and rip it

That motherfucker is screwing' it

Buy it, roll it, lick it,smoke it, choke on it later



[Verse 1: Logic]
God damn, this shit is viscious
Because my main bitch in this world is really my mistress
Feel like I knew this already
Like I been through this already
I'ma have to do this already
In my mind, yes I done it, yes I run it
Keeping it 100
Flow crazy, shit is amazing
No it don't ever faze him
Yeah, they takin' shots, but they never graze him


[Hook]
And if I open my mind, what I hope...
I said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
And if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
I said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real



TBD (Teased on Instagram Livestream)



This song, man, this song is a lot to me. It's, first and foremost, another one produced by 6ix again, and it was just, it was something I wanted the world to know. You know, the duality of man. Being raised in a household full of drugs, guns, violence, just all that, but not letting it effect who you are, because on the first verse I'm rapping from the perspective of little Bobby, me, just that little kid in that house and all the things that he witnessed and on the second verse, I'm rapping from the perspective of my brother, someone who was in the streets and running around, maybe doing things that he shouldn't have done at the time

So for me, it was like showing you, what can come from the same household. The left, or you can go right. I think a lot of people, go that traditional route, when you're raised around these things that can touch you. In a negative way, I think. For me I just saw it as a very positive, and decided to do my best not to go down the same route as a lot of my family members, unfortunately. So this is basically just the story of possibility. Of what can come, and what can happen and my rendition, if you will, of stop the violence, its also sort of an homage to KRS-One as well, thats why I threw his vocals in there. But yeah, I just wanted people to know what happens where I come from in Maryland, as beautiful as a place it is, its also a dark place, and I think thats everywhere you go in the world. Me not going down that route that my brothers did, hence the title "Gang Related," and yeah, that's it



[Logic & Sunny]
...most, living the life that -- oh, shit

[Instrumental]

Sunny, what's up, man

What's good?

Uh, I'm in a lab, I'm in a booth right now, what's good with you?

Shit, chilling out, eating

Yeah man, uh, was you feeling that joint I did on that beat you sent me?

I heard that shit, that shit cold, G



[Intro]
Oh, okay
Damn
Alright, check it check it check it
I said "Hey now, brother!"
Check it check it check it check it check it

[Verse 1]
L-O-G-I-C, all up in this vicinity
You know it's me
This is how we do it all day, god damn
Can you feel it
All up in the spirit
I could do it, LA, hell yeah
Let me get it for the Bay
From the M, to the D, to the NYC
This is how we do it
Bout to kick this free off the top
This is how we do it all the time
I just kicked Nicky in the fucking face, god damn
Can you feel it when I'm all up in the place
Gotta do it right now, gotta do it right now
When I spit it, no you know I'm never lost
Hold up, tell me Big, how much does a pie cost?
Let me get it, let me spit it
Let me bring it back like this
We having a good time, design this rhyme
I spit random thought off the top of my mind
God damn, can you feel it
Yes I got it, feeling hella good
I got no driver's license but you know I'm driven
The second I spit it, everything you know is what I'm giving
Yeah I get it off the top, T-O-P, I gotta say it
I spray it, never delay it
The second I made it there, god damn
Imma get it on, gotta get it on
Gotta spit it, I get it, I rip it
Can you feel it now
Like I'm Jamaican, "I'm spitting off the top, brotha"
God damn let me get it, word to your mother
I'm having fun, gotta do it
Never never packed a gun
Cause I spit it off the top, like a ton, god damn
Yeah I gotta do it one time
Def Jam, VISA
This is how we do it, ease up
Please up, can you feel it all up in my spirit
It doesn't even matter random thought
This decision, I get a second incision
I spit it, and this is how we do it
Yeah I gotta get it
Never regret it the second I said it
It's so fucking pathetic
You edit, get murdered
You predict and bring it back again
Half white half black again
This is all they wanna talk about
And yeah, I'm [?]
I got Crystal B to the right
Louis G to the left
Everything is out of sight
And I'm going off Under Pressure, October 21st
Already came out, gotta spit this free verse
Strictly off the top
I never drop, never stop
Oh, god damn
Go to Best Buy and fucking cop
Get the physical
This is how we do it so medicinal
No I'm never smoking but your girl is choking on a dick
Woo! Sorry about that
Let me bring it back
Can you feel it, god damn, god damn
I could go on for days and days
Never delays and -lays
This is how we do it spit it
Think I need some sun rays

[Verse 2]
I been in the house too long just spitting this
Let me change up the beat, yeah I'm ripping this
I got it on
You know you got it on the ones and the twos
Doing what-it-do's
I'm from Maryland
In your system like heroin
This is how we do it
Can you feel it when I'm staring and
I'm going and going
I'm flowing and flowing
I'm flipping and libbing
I'm striving to kill in the rap
I gotta get it right now
When I do it, when I got it
When we quit
You want me to stop?
Should I stop?
Should I keep going?
Should I keep flowing?
Never knowing the direction in which I'm going
I spit it, I got it
I gotta get it, god damn

[Hook: Power 106]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 3]
My favorite song of all time is what?
Something by Wu-Tang
Or maybe Ice Cube - It Was A Good Day
This is all I gotta say
Yeah you know the deal
Yeah you know the deal, how I feel
I could keep going and going
And going and going and going on
This is how we do it till the break of dawn
God damn, I was in New York yesterday
Now I'm in LA, I just don't know what to say
I'm feeling so damn good
Feeling so damn fine
Like Mos Def and Brooklyn in a bar
West in park, come out after dark
That's where the murder start
Now let me stop, let me stop
Let me keep it going
This is how we do it
Switch the beat up again
Switch the beat up again, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Check it, check it
Let me keep it up
This is how we do it
Let me beat it up
I'm feeling this feeling this vibe
This shit is hella crazy
You never amaze me
I'm never feeling lazy
Like I said, this is random thought
The shit that can't be taught
It's just emotional
I never provoke it
I spit it never choke it
God damn listen
No 8 Mile, B-Rabbit
The second I spit it
I gotta have it
I gotta do it
Never dab it like my homie
[?] at the crib
This is how we do it
Put it in the bitch's rib
Everything I got that's what I'm 'finna get
But my queen, she's a beauty
This is how we do it
God damn such a cutie
Let me spit it
Yeah, she's sweet like five stars
I gotta get it right now
I'm kinda hungry boutta' hit Five Guys (pause)
I'm just fucking around
Let me get it, no beef
Nah, we squash that
This is how we do it
We 'bout the lettuce, toss that
God damn it's so crazy
Such a particular case
My man Louis G look like he just came back from outer space
This is much more than a hare race
You're moving at a snail's pace
God damn, I'm just switching the flow, never know
Half white, half negro
You know we gotta spit it that's fo' sho'
I love who I am
Love who I ain't
This is how we do it
Let me spit it
Just let me paint the picture
The second I get richer
I get bigger
Can you feel it the second I got it
I got six figures and commas
I never pause though
Unless I need it
This is how we do it
That's word of Anita
We need to bring it back
I love the beat
Let's go again, let's go again
Let's go again, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Check it, check it
Let me spit it like this is so ridiculous
God damn, I know you feel it
Wu-Tang hit you with the killer beat
God damn, that's my thing
When I spit it, when I sing
Oh my god, going crazy
It never does amaze me
Never lazy
When I spit it off the top
The topic is hella awesome
CKE is still transcribing!



This one, wow, this one meant a lot to me. First and foremost because the original "Growing Pains I & II" were on mixtapes and before this album, I did the mixtape Welcome To Forever and there was no "Growing Pains" from any part of the series on that. So I think a lot of people thought that "it's over" and that there wasn't going to be another one, and i wanted to give them that feeling of "wow!" "Growing Pains III" and all these people who heard these things on the mixtape like "Man, he's still there. He's still Logic," like "wow." I'm a fan, I know what it's like, and you kind of dread like "ohh, what's that album gonna sound like?" For me, I wanted to give them this

It opens up with a skit, and I love Wu-Tang Clan, so I always loved their skits, so it's basically about the first time I ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy. And then it opens up:

Outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion

And I'm about fifteen years old at that time, and the gunshots, I still hear them every now and then throughout my life and I'm wondering, I always used to wonder "What caused that shootout?" Why did I hear his? What was it? So I kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was, in fact, a true event. So that goes in, when you first hear me rapping I'm laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind, from the eviction notice on my door to being on food stamps and welfare, not knowing whats going to happen tomorrow; just all the wonders. And then the beat changes up and I actually fall asleep. So this is my inner-most subconscious thoughts that I didn't even realize at the time, at fifteen years old, but now at twenty-four and looking back, reminiscing, I know that those are the things that are on my mind, because growing up in that situation, no matter what, the only time I was special, the only time I was anybody was when I was asleep. When I was asleep I was a famous basketball player, baseball player, I was a rapper/artist, I was a singer, I was an actor, I was dancer, I was an astronaut, but when I woke up I was just a boy from a broken home. That was very hard to swallow

Even touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family, you know growing up on The Cosby's  and Family Matters, that was the closest thing I had to a real family. Once the television program turned off, or our electricity turned off [Laughs], I snapped back to reality. I didn't end it on a bright note, because there's people out there that feel that same way, so I wanted them to know that I'm with them. I'm there. I was there, I understand



This song first came along when uh.. When 6ix, me and 6ix were in the studio, uh, at No I.D.'s spot and.. uh he just did the sample, y'know? He had it.. and I loved it and I couldn't identify it at first. I felt like I knew what it was, but I could not exactly identify it, uh.. and it ended up being this song that um.. No I.D. had sampled for Kanye West's "Bound". And I think it's so incredible how you can sample, y'know.. you give something to ten different producers or rappers and you'll get ten different things and, and, we got something different with this one and for this.. song I wanted it to be extremely musical and beautiful and.. y'know.. it's a very very raw hip-hop album, but.. I wanted to kinda mess people up when they first heard it, um and yeah. So it's just kinda talking about the state of hip-hop and not just hip-hop but music as well and where I see myself and kind of where I fit in to it.. um.. before really beginning to tell my story on the next record



[Part 1]

[Verse 1: Logic]
God damn, this shit is vicious
'Cause my main bitch in this world is really my mistress
Feeling like I knew this already, like I've been through this already
Yeah I'm ready to do this already
In my mind, yes I've done it, yes I run it
Keeping it 100, flow is crazy, shit is amazing
No it don't ever phase him
Yeah they taking shots but they never graze him

[Hook: Logic]
And If I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
Said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
And if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real
I said if I open my mind, what I hope to find is real

**Part 2**

[Femi Santiago: Introduction]
This a song for the Government
You tried for so long to enslave all men
But I'm here to state when
You say your commands
I'm not following them, no
I don't speak on behalf of all God's children
I speak to inspire everyone
That we will stand stronger in the millions
Battling for our freedom

[Chorus: 1]
So don't tell me that I do not matter
I'll show you how one person can influence
Change to what is going wrong
Solely Son, because this really matters
If we stand as one block
Then we can unlock our shackles
Cause I am the master of me
Whatever goes is what I say
It doesn't matter if they agree it's gon' be my way
Cause you are the master of you
Whatever goes is what you say
It doesn't matter if they agree it's gon' be my way

[Logic: Verse 1]
Look, tell your slave master that I'm MY own master (I am the master of me)
Tell your slave master that I'm my own master (And you are the master of you)
Tell your slave master that I'm my own master (That I am my own master)
Go and tell your slave master that I'm my own master (You can't tell me nothin')
'Cause I am powerful
I possess everything in the world I need to survive
And you are powerful because
God made everyone the same if you're looking inside
We deserve to know how the so-called leaders of countries meet and decide
If we go to war 'cause I stand with the people that think that we don't have to fight
But if it's necessary then we bally up
Burn down the oppressor, yeah we rally up
Imagine if the riots were really planned out
The people met and had London all mapped out
Set targets, i.e. fed stations
For politicians to the big corporations, Illuminati members and the masons
Anyone that don't burn Satan
Revelations; mind changing
Habeas corpus: fake legislation
Education needs the arranging
God's law is the law of our nation
God's law is the law of our nation
God's law is the law of our nation
God's my master and I found God in me
So I am the master of me

[Femi Santiago: Chorus 2]
Tell me: I do not matter
Show you how one person can influence change to what is going wrong
So, listen this really matters
Cause I am the master of me
Whatever goes is what I say
It doesn't matter if they agree it's gon' be my way
Like you are the master of you
Whatever goes is what I say
It doesn't matter if they agree or not
It's gonna be the way
I am the master of me
And it doesn't matter if they agree it's gon' be my way
Like you are the master of you
Whatever goes is what you say
It doesn't matter if they agree or not
It's gonna be your way
I am the master of me
Whatever goes is what I say
It doesn't matter if they agree it's gon' be my way
Like you are the master of you
Whatever goes is what you say
It doesn't matter if they agree or not
It's gonna be your way

So, how this verse came about almost two years ago, when I wrote this record, the first half, I was on tour, and I remember it being in the front of the tour bus and just looking at the open desert and just kind of writing this rap. Uh, Kebu from Atlanta originally did the first rendition of this song, um, with the sample that we later replayed, um, that's when I brought in DJ Khalil... and it was kind of just the fun, braggadocios-ness of hip hop, yet really beginning to tell my story as well - Just in the flow, the cadence, kinda just showing off skill, um, but still telling that story and painting the picture of where the album conceptually was headed

On the second half, uh, that's where, you know you really get into, uh, just the mental state of a hungry emcee, you know, releasing his first album. So for me, um, this song is just damn near six minutes of hip hop, you know, the emcee - Who I am, and how I want to be perceived.... As an artist



[Intro]
Check it, check it

Yeah, black and white it's kinda crazy
It's funny how people can perceive you
But it doesn't really matter cause I gotta get the preview with these lyrics so
If you really wanna know cop the album Under Pressure
For the real, not the lesser, what's up

[Interlude]
One more topic, Open Bar

[Verse 4]
Goin' platinum, man it seems like it never happens
Unless you Taylor Swift
Man I gotta be extra swift, with the real
Yeah I gotta do it, this is how we feelin' homie
I'm tryin' to make it to the ceiling homie
Yeah, hundred thousand in a week, maybe, maybe not
It doesn't matter cause it's all about the fans and the Rattpack is all we got, yeah



This is... one of my favorites on the album. It's produced by Rob Knox and myself, and um, it's such a blast with him, creating the song. You know, the classic break and just kind of doing my rendition of that break and putting that together and then Rob just playing the keys and it rose over... it's just such an incredible vibe. It's basically a tale of, um, my time around the world - touring. Starting out in College Park, Maryland with all the homies back in the basement, hitting the road, in a minivan, for the first time, you know what I'm saying? The first time ever, in the freezing cold, going to Chicago and selling out my first show there... and different things like that until eventually going to Europe and riding the train and [I] ended up in Belgium and Amsterdam and Switzerland and this and that and all these really beautiful places. I just wanted to talk about it. Talk about my fear of flying, which I'm getting over, all these, just, I wanted the people to hear the humility and the honesty and just like, you know...

It's weird, even now, recording this for Spotify and the listeners now, like, I-I love Spotify, this is where I find all my samples and to think that theres somebody out there, listening to me talk to them, and they want to know about my album; it's very surreal. That's what I believe encompasses  the song, at least that's what... Yeah, it's just about my travels; from A to B, here to there, and everywhere in between. It was originally going to be called "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," but I went with "Metropolis," the neo-city of-of the world, if you will, it's definitely filled with my cinematic inspiration - And you can hear it, so yeah, yeah, enjoy it



[Verse 1]

They call me L-O-G-I-C up in NYC
Spittin' it off the top of the dome
Murkin' they chromosomes
Can you feel it
The second I inhale it
Never despair it we got it
Yes I been risen, hit em' real quick
Off the top, never written
Goddamn, can you feel it, said can you feel it

It's crazy running into fans shake your hand, shit
And on occasion runnin' into some stans
That'll do anything just to get their demo in your hands
I tell em it's all love, I wish you the best fam, and man
On the real, it's really hella crazy
This is how we do it, let me get it for the fans

Smoking in London while the snow fall
In another country so pardon me for the roll call
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense
On the first fucking train to Paris so pardon my french
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, "bitch please, what up?"
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel
I hit my ex, check it, I hit my ex

Strictly off the top, never written
That is what we doing now
Gotta spit it off the top, like blao
L-O-G-I-C I'm reppin' MD to the fullest
Push us but never pull us we got it
Goddamn, can you feel it

Actin' like they know me
But they don't so y'all can blow me
Chilling with the homie Tony
Yes we got it off the top
The t-o-p I do it to the fullest
So let me keep it going
So let me keep it flowing
Get it get it, like that



[Intro: Lucy Rose]
Tout est si bon, tout est si bon
Tout est si bon, tout est si bon
Parce que je me sens bien, si bien
Parce que je me sens bien, si bien, si bien
Je souhaite que toi aussi, je souhaite que toi aussi
Je souhaite que toi aussi, je souhaite que toi aussi
Je souhaite que toi aussi, c'est ma vie
C'est mon tout, c'est mon tout
Et maintenant je suis heureux, en ce moment je suis heureux, mais parfois

[Refrain: Logic]
Je vais envahir ton esprit maintenant
Je vais envahir ton, je vais l'avoir
Je vais envahir, envahir
Je vais envahir, envahir, envahir, envahir
Je vais envahir ton esprit maintenant
Te donnant l'impression de mourir maintenant
Je vais te faire prier Dieu
L'ancien bon seigneur pour un signe maintenant
A l'ancien bon seigneur
Je vais envahir ton esprit maintenant
Te donnant l'impression de mourir maintenant
Je vais te faire prier Dieu
L'ancien bon seigneur pour un signe maintenant
A l'ancien bon seigneur

[Couplet 1: Logic]
"Je vais le faire un jour, par n'importe quel moyen" c'est ce que tu te dis
Mais t'es pas concentré sur ce qui est important: le mental, la santé
Tout le monde dans le monde ne veut qu'une seule chose, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Le pouvoir infini et une poche pleine de richesse
C'est comme, oh, je vais te ramener à la base
Personne ne peut l'effacer
Les gens dans la rue deviennent fous
Battant la dépression mais personne ne veut rien dire
Je vais te ramener à la base
Je vais te ramener à la base
Je vais me lever, progresser
C'est ce sur quoi j'étais
Je joue avec ta tête, j'allume ces choses
Mais ils veulent me qualifier comme un méchant
Même si je suis là pour ouvrir leur esprit
Aux travers des vers de la vie
Je vais ouvrir leur esprit et désigner le bon moment
Pour prendre une décision et mettre en eux comme une incision
Parce que je vais les frapper et les faire vivre
Ils demandent ce que je donne, je ne vais jamais le dire
Je vais laisser tout le monde le découvrir
Je suis dans leur tête maintenant

[Refrain: Logic]
Je vais envahir ton esprit maintenant
Je vais envahir ton, je vais l'avoir
Je vais envahir, envahir
Je vais envahir, envahir, envahir, envahir
Je vais envahir ton esprit maintenant
Te donnant l'impression de mourir maintenant
Je vais te faire prier Dieu
L'ancien bon seigneur pour un signe maintenant
A l'ancien bon seigneur
Je vais envahir ton esprit maintenant
Te donnant l'impression de mourir maintenant
Je vais te faire prier Dieu
L'ancien bon seigneur pour un signe maintenant
A l'ancien bon seigneur

[Couplet 2: Logic]
Je vais te ramener à la base
Personne ne peut l'effacer
Les gens dans la rue deviennent fous
Battant la dépression mais personne ne veut rien dire
Pourquoi personne ne veut le dire:
Je vivais avec ça tous les jours
Pourquoi personne ne veut dire:
Tout ira bien
Je vais le ramener à la base
Tout ira bien
Je me souviens en quelque sorte
Je me souviens en quelque sorte
Je me souviens en quelque sorte
Je me souviens en quelque sorte

[Discours: Logic]
C'était en décembre 2015 dans un Los Angeles ensoleillé en Californie, au milieu d'Hollywood
Je me tenais à côté de ma femme dans une ligne entourée par des centaines d'autres personnes pour aller voir Star Wars
Quand j'ai soudainement été pris par la peur et la panique
Comme si mon corps pâlissait
A ce moment là, mon esprit était bien de clarté
Mais mon corps insistait sur le fait qu'il était en danger
J'ai regardé autour de moi et je me suis dis que j'étais en sécurité, j'étais bien
Mais j'étais convaincu que quelque chose n'allait pas
Avant que je le sache, je me sentais comme partant dans une chute, une fonte
Mon corps est devenu faible
Et pas longtemps après, j'étais dans un lit d'hôpital découvrant que je traversais l'anxiété
J'ai refusé d'y croire
J'ai cherché et cherché la cause de ce qui m'étais arrivé
J'ai commencé à me sentir détaché de la réalité
J'ai senti comme voyant le monde aux travers du verre
J'ai fait une prise de sang
Analyse de mon cerveau et de mon corps
Le docteur a dit que c'était de l'anxiété
Mais comment est-ce que ça pouvait l'être?
Comment l'anxiété aurait pût me donner l'impression de tomber de la balance?
Comment l'anxiété aurait pût me donner l'impression que je disparaissais de ce monde et que j'étais sur le palier de la mort?
Déséquilibrage
L'impression d'être en dehors de ce corps
Je ne suis pas là
Je ne suis pas moi
Je ne suis pas réel
Rien n'est
Rien mais ce sentiment de panique
Personne ne comprend
Personne ne connait la douleur
Ce sentiment physique
Ça ne peut être l'anxiété
Cela ne peut
Oh, ça peut?
Ça peut être en fait l'esprit contrôlant le corps?
Oui, bien sûr
Je suis en plein contrôle de mon esprit et mon corps
Mais je suis subconsciemment en train de me forcer dans un état
D'auto-esclavage impliqué par les bords de mon propre esprit
Je suis malheureux
Pas avec la vie
Mais avec ce sentiment
J'ai peur, je suis humain, je suis un homme
Mais je regarde dans le miroir et j'y vois un enfant
Je suis un adulte qui reconnaît que les adultes n'y connaissent vraiment rien
Et ils ne l'ont jamais fait
Et ça m'effraie
Parce que maintenant je ne suis qu'un adulte qui n'y connaît rien
Mais une chose, c'est que je connais ce sentiment, ce sentiment terrible qui va me tuer
Non, pas ce sentiment
L'anxiété n'est rien
Je suis anxieux
Juste comme toi, la personne pour qui j'ai écrit ça
Et ensemble, nous allons passer au dessus de ce sentiment
On va se rappeler malgré les attaques et les hauts et les bas de nos corps
Que nous sommes en vie
Et au moment où nous nous serons débarrassé de ce sentiment que nous ne prendrons pas pour acquis
On va se réjouir dans ce cadeau qu'est la vie
On va se réjouir en ce jour qui nous a été donné
On va accepter notre anxiété et lutter pour bien être de nous même
En commençant avec la santé mentale
Nous allons nous accepter comme nous sommes
Et nous allons être heureux avec les gens que nous voyons dans le miroir
On va s'accepter
Et vivre avec l'anxiété

[Outro: ?]
C'est la première fois de toute ma vie que j'ai fait quelque chose de la sorte
Ça montre bien où on va



This song, to me, this was like the actual first song... I guess, that you could say with structure, you know like um, just verse, hook, bridge. It was much more than just a beautiful intro, and much more than just six minutes of raps, like the previous record, this was a full length song. This is, you know, "okay, we get it, the kid can rap, the kid can, you know, have fun, but let me hear him create something" and thats what I wanted to do on "I'm Gone." Funny enough, 6ix produced damn near the majority of the entire album himself, and we were in the studio and we had just finished, um, I think it was, uh, the intro, I think it was one of the last ones that we did actually, and on the ride home he was like "Man, I just want to get one more, just one more" and I was like "Hey, if you can do it..." And then the next day, you know, he made this beat and um, and I wrote to it and for me this is my inspiration. Me talking about my old inspiration. Maybe just money and women and cars, the cliche hip hop thing that I think a lot of people kind of get into hip hop for, just fun stuff, but kind of getting rid of that and going "I'm going to tell my story," finding the inspiration of wanting to just be myself, and let the world know who I am and just make.... music. So it sounds as though I'm talking about a woman, getting rid of my own "woman," and getting with my new "woman" - my new inspiration and leading into this album



[Verse 1]
Said this a freestyle, it's strictly off the top of the dome
I'm in N.Y.C, about two thousand miles from home
I'm in the zone, murder your chromosome in an instant
Hit it like killer instinct
The second I get it, it's so hypnotic
Goddamn, I'm a miraculous man
I grip the microphone and this is how we do it, E.T phone home
I'm on another constellation when I spit it
This is how we do it, yes I rip it, yes I gotta get it
This that Mos Def, Illadelph, The Roots, Black Thought
The shit that never taught
Goddamn, can you feel it now
R.A double T.P.A.C.K all day, every day yeah
Just having a good time spittin' this rhyme
Never written cause that shit is forbidden, feelin' sublime, goddamn
I said I'm feelin' myself, goddamn, feelin' good, I said I'm feelin' my health
With my homie Big Kenny to the right of my side, with my homie, homie Nick to the left of my side
Gotta spit it, gotta rip it for that Maryland pride
You know the dilly, this is how we do it, word to Philly
And everybody in that dry state, watch me migrate to the moon and back, goddamn
God-goddamn, I'm just feelin' this villainous vibe
L.O.G.I.C, we gotta get it, peace to The Tribe Called Quest
Uh, take one to the chest, gotta wear a vest, never the less
Might cop a motherfucken' feel on your bitch's breasts
I'm just having a good time, having a good time
Once again I said none of this shit is written, phone out of sight
This is how we do it, goddamn feelin' hella right
Yea I'm feelin' good and yea I said I'm vibin'
This is how we do it with my homies and we tribin'
Freestyle, the art of a rhyme, this is random thought
Once again, I said this is shit that can never be taught, yea

[Verse 2]
It's the type of shit they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and Big
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant for me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I never left, I said that real shit
A little bit of written, but it might be forgiven
Goddamn, I'm living
That's how I'm living
I said I got it, L.O.G.I.C this is how I'm living, yeah



[Verse 1]
Check the verse gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
I'm spitting this venom, strictly off the T.O.P
How we do it N.Y.C
L.O.G.I.C I'm repping M.D yes y'all know the deal
We keep it real, that's all the time
Hella sublime I represent, for the city
Can you feel me off he top
It's never written cause that shit is forbidden
I gotta spit it hella crazy, feeling feeling hella lazy
Cause I was out, at this listening party
Last night, shorties getting naughty
Goddamn, oh lordy I'm just having fun
I'm just, having a good time
Visionary paint the picture like pictionnary
I'm fucking your bitch, maybe missionary
Goddamn, just having a good time, spitting sublime
Can you feel it Rosenberg, homie, homie that's the word
I gotta get it like this
October 21 with the illest verse, disperse, I got it
Under Pressure
It's never lesser, and so is on this
Shout out to big Nas, Nasir Jones
Going through your headphones
This is how we spit it, this is how we do it all night
Late night let me get it
L.O.G.I.C we got it right yeah

[Verse 2]
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gonna remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove
Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun



[Intro]
Yeah!
You're trying to beat this game right now?

[Verse 1]
This is level 10, it's level 10 y'all
This is level 10, it's level 10 y'all
Gotta use your logic, the force
Gotta use your logic, the force to get pass
To make it to the end
Make it to the end, don't pretend
Come on be my friend
Tell me how you're feeling the second I'll do it
I've been dealing on that real ish
I've been dealing on that real ish, uhh
I'm the boss of all bosses
Not one to floss but I need it
This is how we do it I gotta feel it, right now
I can feel it from the whole style
'Bout to kill this whole motherfucking shit freestyle
Up the top of the dome
Send them all home
If you can't beat this level that's word to the devil
What you gonna do?
I'm pullin' strings like Geppetto, can you feel me now?
'Cause I wanna be a real boy
Can you beat this level? I don't know (let me hear that)
I'm gonna make it, yeah, I got the force
I wish Kan was Obi
Louis Vuitton dot Kenobi
That would make me dot D
Luke Skywalker 'cause I'm a fly talker, not a death star
But they ain't ready for that, that's from the demos right there
That's that Damian Lamar Hudson first real project out the game
Elysium, what?
See, that's why you gotta wait
That's why you're so happy
You're at level 10 right now
Mess around, giving you all freestyles, check it
Uh, I've been working all night
[inaudible]
What you're talking about?
You can't give 'em that
I've been grinding, working really hard
But it's gonna be a while
'Cause I'm taking my time, feel the style
Can you understand?
I gotta get it, that's my man
L-O-G-I-C, I'm reppin' MD to the fullest
They push us but never pull us
And we out in LA, yeah
I've been chillin' on my compund
That house going down
Can you feel the smile? Nah, nah, never frown
I gotta keep it real good when you come around
Tell me how you feeling right now
I'm a villain right now
'Cause I'm the boss of all bosses, said I'm the boss
Can you make it to Elysium? I don't know
All you other motherfuckers wack as hell
You're wack as hell!
Level 10, woo!
Level 10, yeah yeah
And if you hear me rapping still it means you ain't make it yet
Why the hell you ain't beat this level?
You ain't good enough or something?
You suck! You suck at playing video games!
You're just a lame but I'm not the same



Fly away
I've missed you when I tried to say
I had to fly away
But I'll be over you some day

Fly away
I've missed you when I tried to say
I had to fly away
But I'll be over you some day

[Instrumental]

(Yeah, yeah)
I guess we back again
Everybody just vibe in there
Mmm, I guess we back again
Everybody just vibe in there



Yea I gotta spit it off the top here in N.Y.C
You know how we do it, homie gotta get it the free
Strictly off of the top, off the T.O.P
Yea I said it, never regret it, I gotta bring it back now
Half white, half black now
Already said it, I'm doing this
This is how we do it when you chewin this
Goddamn, RattPack all day, this is how we do it yea
From here to the Bay, uh, about to hit the plane to L.A
Goddamn, yea I'm feeling hella good
Under Pressure in stores right now, number one on iTunes
Goddamn, motherfucker, "vrume vrume vrume"
About to get the car of my dreams, this is how we do it, me and my team
It's much more than a sixteen, but I'm kinda feeling it
Yea, cause I'm a rap fiend
Goddamn, I'm the man, I could give a damn
This is the plan
Let me spit it, let me get it, let me rip it like this
Gotta flow cause you already know this is how we do it
Hell yea, every, every show like that



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Power 106
L.A. Leakers
Logic
Rattpack
We gon' jump into these bars

[Verse]
So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease
Got it capiche? This is my house you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle
Paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowing what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hollow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you
So I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow
You whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky
I'mma dominate the world like my name was Brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page
To numb the pain like novacaine
Yeah
Allow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic
Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Rip the mic to set the example
While all these mu-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force feed enemies truth serum
We want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
In your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it
I get from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat you a pussy
Knuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, In they mind
Cuz I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to planes I catch dames
They catch feelings
Haters keep my name in they mouth like fillings
High as the ceiling
Ya'll really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
Thankful for every breath I'm giving
Fuck social division
That's how I'm living
What's the deal
Gotta keep it real
Now tell me how you feel
It's Logic



[Intro: Steve Wyreman]
Aight, well, higher probably, right? Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?

[Verse 1]
I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Yeah, yeah
But I'm, not defined by the sales of my first week
Cause in my mind the only way I fail, if my verse weak
As I, look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races gathering from different places
I just contemplate
Shoutout to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates
It’s like, I'mma get up today
I don’t know how but I'mma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of grey
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'mma get up today
I don’t know how but I'mma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of grey
Feeling like my dream is a world away
What it feel like
I used to wonder what it feel like
Yeah, used to wonder what it

[Hook]
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like

[Post-Hook]
You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything

[Outro]
Hello
Welcome to the Under Pressure program
My name is Thalia
I will be here to assist you
With the information about the album and its creation



Check it
We out in cali, chillin in this alley
'Bout to smoke this jack, never not a black
Half white, that's a fact
When I spit it I rip it, it's so ridiculous
They never understand it demand it why, because because
I'm rippin' and livin and strivin' to kill it
I gotta get it right now
This is how we do it, goddamn, homie check the style
I got this album coming out soon, October 21st
Be the first to rip the verse
I never spit this curse
But I curse, on a verse, yeah I got it
This is how we do it cause the flow is so hypnotic
Goddamn, L-O-G-I-C they know me out in L.A
Up in N.Y.C. and M.D. that is me
Yes it's every day
I'm kickin' it off the top, like I did back with Sway
And this is how we do it, RattPack all day
R-A-double T-P-A-C-K, B-O-double B-Y
They may not know the name
But they gon' know it when this fame
Comes to this
Dames, come to this
Second I spit it I run with this
Goddamn it's strictly off the top of the dome
It's off the topic, I never stop it
I never grip the mic unless I plan to drop it
After this fire
Spit a desire this is how we do it goddamn
Work for hire, this is how we do it
Can you feel it Rattpack Visionary
V's up all day
It's Logic



This one, this, I don't know this one was just fun, I did this on random at the crib one night with 6ix... And we were just having fun. It's braggadocios, it's fun and it's kind of like a "fuck you" to everybody. But it's not a "fuck you" like "Till The End" was, it's more so like, uh, like "fuck you." [Laughs] Just having a good time, but that's "Now" in a nutshell



This one, this one is, yeah I love "Never Enough," because this is another party type record. I mean, it's still extremely conceptual, but for me, it's like as many women as you get, as much money as you have, you know, weed you smoke, liquor you drink whatever, whatever you're thing is it's never enough. Human beings always want more, we are never satisfied we are non complacent and it's much more than just partying or this-or-that, it's along the lines of our profession. In school, we want more, we want better grades, and uh, in the workplace we want promotions, "we want this, we want this" so it's just never enough. And short and sweet, thats what that is and I got with DJ Dahi for this one, who is a incredible producer, and, uh, we just had a great time in the studio. And thats how that got made



[Hook]
Lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all feel me
Oh lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all know the deal
Lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all feel me
Oh lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all know the deal

[Verse 1]
White boy at first glance
Well that's ‘til I do enhance
Got that shit to make you think
Got that shit to make you dance
It’s been a long journey
I had to find my way
Making music that I love no matter what the haters say
Cause sometimes I wanna vibe
And other times I'm ready to rip it up bury the track alive
So long to my nine to five
New school sound, but you know the flow is 1995
So let me elaborate
This is food for thought homie grab a plate
I’m on a different planet
You should gravitate
The second I generate ideas they elevate
Feelin’ great
Ain’t know way you could replicate
Swimmin' in elegance
What’s a pretty face with no intelligence
Its like a stronger fence
With no witnesses or evidence
Case closed
I erase those
Such as fake hoes
And replace those
With beautiful woman

[Hook]
Lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all feel me
Oh lemme break it down
Break it down
Break it down so you all know the deal



[Prelude]
For making some of those extra special reed disks for your entertainment

[Logic: Intro]
You stupid dope
Yeah
Prest-o, manifest-o the best-o so let's go
The flow is subsequential
Watch me outline like a stencil
Talent undeveloped is like an unsharpened pencil
Whole lot of potential that needs some fine sharpening
Now watch me drop it
Finished product they finna cop it
Can't ever stop it
I'm OCD with this rap shit
Now let it hit

[Brial: Verse 1]
Aye yo
Me dope, literally
Feel no sympathy
Feel no empathy
Flow so ill, if I don't spit it's killing me
You got zero ability
I've got superhero agility
Spit, leave em open like availability
24/7 like warehouse utility
Currently the current like electricity
Step into the room, I e-ffect energy

[Logic: Verse 2]
Me and Brail ain't on the same page
We on the same brainwave
And murder fuckers that don't know how to behave
Literally
Smoke that ass like Hickory B
This hip-hop shit rock shit never stop it I spit for profit

[Brial: Verse 3]
Long, kisses goodnight for those who sleep on the mic
Supposed the, message inclosed— I was destined to blow like Jonny Depp
As Boston George
I'm dope but how much dope could the heart endure
Rap style galore and that's final like the four plus four, get you eight, Carnivore
Rap door
Jesus Christ was so nice each bar's like the rapture and I don't need a drug test to tell I'm a dope rapper

[Logic: Verse 4]
Bustin' your chromosomes, my name is Sir now where's my throne?
Homie I hold my own
Keep your system nervous like prednisone
Stand-off the static
Phony MCs I've done had it
When shit get dramatic
I am liable to bust some static
Lyrical addict
Rehabilitation I'm at it, yes the studio where I take care of all of my foes

Fucker... tah haaa

[Brial: Verse 5]
Most wanted, but one of the most competitive
Veteran sick no Excedrin medicine its evident I’m heaven sent
Who you think you better than
My rhymes gon’ sink out
My lyrics gon’ settle in
This is sink or swim business, I’m dog peddlin’
I got a purple heart in my art, bring the medal in

[Logic: Verse 6]
I'm bringing the medal in
I never do meddle in
Business that ain't mine intertwine like a thick grapevine
No way that AJ rhyme, with a style like mine
Now get it poppin'

[Brial]
Yeah
[Logic]
You feel me?
[Brial]
Of course, homie

[Logic: Verse 7]
Now get it poppin'
Ain't no way that we gon' be stoppin'
Bitches is droppin’ they panties antsy to come get the hop in

[Brial: Verse 8]
To be honest, my flow glow shine like new polish
Whatever you call it
I'm the new Christopher Wallace
Billboard says Logic and Brial additional artist
So you ain't Logic or Brial so you an additional artist
I deal with so much fire like I'm addicted to arson
Daily like Carson
Smoke it like a carton
Of cigarettes

[Logic and Brial: Outro]
Naw, just stop dog
[Brial]
What's up, man?
[Logic]
The jone is smooth, the jone is tight
[Brial]
Hah, okay
[Logic]
So we gon' keep going
[Brial]
Word, word
[Logic]
Psychological
[Brial]
Word, word
[Logic]
That's right, right?
[Brial]
That's right baby
You know in the whole nine right here
My man Logic holdin' it down
My man behind the behind the producing
You know throwing these uh– sick tracks together
Shoutout to the–my man in the UK, you know. I love the, you know, I just love the way this music thing goes…

Atom: Donc, qu'est-ce que nous attendons?
Dieu: Excuse-moi?
Atom: Donc tu t'es assis ici en me disant que cette salle était une salle d'attente, pas vrai? Qu'attendons-nous alors?
Dieu: Renaissance.
Atom: Renaissance? Comme la réincarnation?
Dieu: Si c'est la manière dont tu veux l'appeler
Atom: Qu'est-ce que tu racontes "Si c'est la manière dont tu veux l'appeler?" Soit ça l'est, soit ça ne l'est pas.
Dieu: Bien sûr.
Atom: Hein? Putain, ce fils de pute. OK, laisse moi mettre les choses au clair: à chaque fois que je meurs, je viens ici, on parle et tu me renvoies sur Terre pour renaître?
Dieu: Tu sais, la dernière fois que nous avons eu cette conversation; c'était en mandarin et tu avais 13 ans.
Atom: Mandarin?
Dieu: Et tu étais une fille.
Atom: Quoi? Non, mec, tu déconnes. Comme... Doux Jésus.
Dieu: Il était ici, lui aussi.
Atom: Quoi? Attend, attend, alors les chrétiens avaient raison?
Dieu: Alors, je suis sur le point de te faire réincarner, Atom. Je dirai que tout le monde avait bien vu.
Atom: C'est beaucoup à avaler.
Dieu: Je sais. Crois-moi, je suis passé par-là.
Atom: Donc, combien de fois ai-je été réincarné?
Dieu: Beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup de fois.
Atom: Si ça en fait autant, pourquoi est-ce que je ne m'en rappelle pas?
Dieu: Si on reste ici assez longtemps; les vies que tu as vécu et les connaissances que tu as acquis de chacune d'elles vont revenir.
Atom: Quoi?
Dieu: Je vais te renvoyer en 1736 en tant que Bryan Fairfax, le 8e baron Fairfax de Cameron.
Atom: Woah, hé ! Cela semble important.
Dieu: Oh oui! Tu détiens 40,000 hectares.
Atom: Mon Dieu! Oh, je suis désolé.
Dieu: Ah, ça va.
Atom: Bien, au moins je ne suis plus pauvre.
Dieu: Oui, bien sûr. Avec toutes ces terres et les centaines d'esclaves que tu détiens.
Atom: Esclaves? Hé ! Putain, non, non, non, non, non, attend, attend, écoute: comment peux-tu prendre un homme noir, le renvoyer dans le temps, et lui faire avoir des esclaves?
Dieu: Bon, si cela peut te consoler: ton fils, Tom, le 9e baron Fairfax de Cameron, va les libérer.
Atom: Non! Cela ne me fait pas sentir mieux du tout! Attend, une minute, je viens seulement de réaliser que tu as dit que tu allais me renvoyer dans le passé?
Dieu: Bien, je ne te renvoies pas vraiment dans le temps. Cela n'existe pas d'où je viens, seulement dans ton univers.
Atom: Alors, d'où viens-tu?
Dieu: Honnêtement, Atom, même si je t'expliquais d'où je viens, ou que je te disais pour les autres moi, tu ne comprendrais juste pas.
Atom: Mais s'il y a des autres toi, comment pourrais-tu être Dieu?
Dieu: Atom, j'ai dit que tu ne comprendrais pas.
Atom: Alors, quel est le but de tout cela?
Dieu: Vraiment?
Atom: Quoi?
Dieu: C'est un peu cliché, tu ne penses pas? Le fait de me demander le sens de la vie.
Atom: Bah, j'ai pensé te demander avant que tu me renvoies et que je ne me souviennes pas de tout cela.
Dieu: Atom, viens-là. Le sens de la vie, la raison pour laquelle j'ai créé cet endroit; c'est pour que tu mûrisses.
Atom: Comme la race humaine? C'est-à-dire que c'est de cette manière que la race humaine est supposée mûrir? Mûrir en quoi? On ne peut même pas s'entendre.
Dieu: Non, Atom, toi! C'est à toi de mûrir.
Atom: Je ne comprends pas.
Dieu: J'ai créé cet endroit pour toi, Atom. L'entièreté de ce lieu a été fait pour toi. A chaque fois que je te renvoies, toutes les vies que tu vis; tu mûris et comprends le grand sens derrière tout cela, juste un peu plus à chaque fois.
Atom: Juste moi? Attend, et pour tous les autres?
Dieu: Atom, il n'y a personne d'autre que toi.
Atom: Je ne comprends pas.
Dieu: Atom, tu es tous les êtres humains qui n'ont jamais existé depuis l'aube de ton existence sur Terre.
Atom: Attend, je suis tout le monde?
Dieu: Ah oui, maintenant tu commences à comprendre.
Atom: Donc je suis comme... toutes les personnes qui ont déjà existé sur Terre, depuis toujours?
Dieu: La Terre? Aha, c'est mignon. La Terre n'est que ton lieu de naissance. N'oublions pas toutes les étoiles que l'humanité a colonisé pendant le millénaire.
Atom: Attend, c'est trop. Trop à prendre. Je suis chaque être humain qui a existé?
Dieu: Ou qui existera, oui.
Atom: Je suis Jésus?
Dieu: Et chacun de ses disciples.
Atom: Je suis Hitler?
Dieu: Et les millions qu'il a tué.
Atom: C'est profond...
Dieu: Tu vois Atom, chaque acte de haine et de violence que tu as commis envers quelqu'un d'autre, tu les as commis envers toi-même, et chaque acte d'amour et de bienveillance, tu les as aussi exercé sur toi-même.
Atom: Dieu, pourquoi tout cela?
Dieu: Un jour lointain, tu deviendras comme moi. Tu vas mûrir pour devenir ce que je suis.
Atom: Je suis un Dieu?
Dieu: Non, pas encore. Tu vois, je me suis un jour tenu là où tu te tiens maintenant. Et je ne te ferai pas quitter cet endroit avant que tu aie vécu toutes les vies de chaque être humain de cet univers. Une fois que tu auras vécu ce que vivent toutes les races, religions, sexes, orientations sexuelles, bonnes ou mauvaises personnes; c'est seulement à ce moment là que tu comprendras à quel point la vie est précieuse.
