Flu game Post people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated shit my rollie still cold
Aye-ye-ye
I got cha-ay-ay-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ay-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is ya'll sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain




I'm in a four-door down rodeo
I'm getting fucked up, I'm losing control
I'm bumping Fleetwood, she tryna turn off my song
She keep asking where the party at
I got a flask full of vodka in my passenger seat
My homie got a mansion says that we could crash it for free
We gotta take the phones because we can't let nobody see
We pop a pill since you ain't have not a thing to eat

Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they are playing
Say women, they will come and they will go

When the rain washes you clean you will know
You will know
You will know
You will know
You will know

'Cause I got dreams, don't hold me down
So I'ma let you free, don't wanna hold you out
I'ma leave when the sun comes

Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they're playing
Say women, they will come and they will go


I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down
Just last night we was going so hard
But now I can't feel my heart
Let me down easy, don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep, getting up is gon' be tough
They was all actin sleazy, they all said I was the one
And with any damn luck, I'ma wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning

And let it pour, let it pour, let it pour let me roll
Man, I'm on a roll I'm so up in my zone
They thought that I was fuckin done with Iverson
But I'm still ballin' on these bitches, let them know
I just want everything, I want it all in advance
They just want me to call it quits
Homie just roll up a zip
Lil Posty don't fuck with y'all
Never been fuckin with y'all
We pull up they standing in awe
Yeah your bitch she know who we are

I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down
Just last night we was going so hard
But now I can't feel my heart
Let me down easy, don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep, getting up is gonna be tough
They was all actin sleazy, they all said I was the one
And with any damn luck, I'ma wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning

Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that?"
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?

Our love love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He remembers the times that y'all had
That's not okay

Our love love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart

Our love love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

So tell me, why, girl? Come on

All this sip I'm sipin' gon' kill me
And motherfuckers walkin' if they ain't ridin' with me
Teeth shine in my mouth
Bad bitches all in my couch
You know it's foreign when I back out
Hit 'em with the woo-wap, she black out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Hoes fall asleep and all they ass' out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Woke up in the spot I'mma cash out

I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
No-op
Santa Fe
Santa Fe

A double cup up for my bitches who on the floor shaking they ass, whoa
Bring it on over but baby forgive me if I took the grab, oh
I'm rocking off white with the camo I'm spilling Ciroc on my Ablo
I'm trying to fuck with some millions I promise won't stop till I have em'

Air Jordans to the ripped jeans I'm in all black with my gold teeth
Put the OG in the codeine your bitch she so thirsty
Said "Oh Lambo Mercy" fuck the police tryna search me
Smoke JUJU tryna curse me
Fuck any motherfucker tryna hurt me
Get smart, quick unzip way too much zip
Undid zip too much zip
Man, fuck out my business
Young Post get the bills quick
Gold chains young white Slick Rick
Boy graining my new whip
Drink 40s till I feel sick

I got drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs
I got bars on bars on bars
ARs, and a bad bitch in my car
Imma do it for my squad
Imma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch imma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad

Homie you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie you's a window shopper
At the dealership trying to get a test drive
Homie you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats my bezel heavy
Doors suicide they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you "youngin' you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell em their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game pose people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated shit my rollie still cold
Aye-ye-ye
I got cha-ay-ay-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ay-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is ya'll sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain

I'm all on my own, always live life on the road
She always be hittin' my phone
It's hard to get rid of her now
She knows that I'm never alone
I don't buy her shit anymore
She always be stealin' my clothes, yeah
Askin' me how does it feel
When you know you could buy out the store, yeah
I came a long way on my own, ayy
We doin' this shit on our own, ayy
These hoes always hit up my phone, yea
Cause I'm always puttin' them on and
I don't give a fuck what I'm told, ayy
I know I'm the next one to blow and
I hate when she calling' me over
Cause I end up falling' for her

He whispered in my ear and told me feel, feel, feel, oh, oh, oh

Fuck me 'til I can't see straight
Make me think that hoe was a mistake
I just need to feel you all the time
Ride hoe, ride hoe, alright, alright, alright



Ya no aguanto mas
No eres en la listas solamente otra mas
En el suelo La ropa
QUE ACABO DE QUITAR
No lo puedo negar
Se lo que va pasar

En otra prespectiva
Yo abajo tu arriba
Yo soy tu vida
Tu las derivaas
Eres bien venida
Niña  pervertida
Se que te gusta cuando al oido
Te dicen que eres  una diva
Tu mi querida
Bandida

Podemos hacerlo cuando tu quiera
Ropa en el suelo y tu yo juntos
En  la bañera
Tu y yo en el acura
Asiendo locuras
En la noche a oscuras
Sin ataduras
Mi dulce lindura !
Tu eres mi cura

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Eres imprudente
Aun asi necesito verte
Hay que vernos donde siempre
Es importante saber. si me entiendes

Dime si me entiendes
Esta noche la recordaras siempre
Todo empezo en el asiento de enfrente
Y ya no te saco de mi mente 
De mi mente

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Dime si es un deja vu
Te deseo y me deseas tu
Dime si es un deja vu
Qe esto ya lo vivi baby buuu

Eres imprudente
Aun asi necesito verte
Hay que vernos donde siempre
Es importante saber. si me entiendes

Dime si me entiendes
Esta noche la recordaras
Siempre
Todo empeso en el asiento de enfrente
Y ya no te saco de mi mente



Hahaha
Turn up

Sell my dues, bring the bottles to the crib
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib
We turnin' up, it's full throttle in this bitch
'Fuck is up with all these haters talkin' shit?
I just poured me up a cup
Call the plug and see what's up
Aye, I just poured me up a cup
Lemme show these haters up

Put the damn lean in the rocka
Balmain, whole screen light the block up
Pull up, ski-mask, balaclava
Damn, let me do the honors
Sign my name over by the commas
Drop the top on the whip for the summer
Just finished this bottle, I'm 'bout to pop another
Tell the waitress "keep 'em comin'"
We always turnt up, ho, it's nothing
And tell my old bitch "don't worry who I'm fuckin'"
Keep the 'Rari engine running, hit the gas and I fuckin' blast past
Blowin' money and I'm laughin' now
RoDayo, drive a 4-2-4, I'm cashin' out

Sell my dues, bring the bottles to the crib
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib
We turnin' up, it's full throttle in this bitch
'Fuck is up with all these haters talkin' shit?
I just poured me up a cup
Call the plug and see what's up
Aye, I just poured me up a cup
Lemme show these haters up

Think 'bout it, fuckin' 'em in a fisher, I'mma foresee
Known to get a little from my side like a temp fade
I be in the A like a wrote a good essay
And add a little L to it when I do my West thing
She be takin' shots, no Goldie
In the spur of the moment like Chernobyl
Keep it a 'hunnid, told me I done it
Told me to run it, drinkin' for nothing
Screamin' out "fuck it", we'll make her buss it

I been runnin' round that bit, ho, fuckin' with a thick chick
Runnin' round this mo'fucker, trynna get my dick licked
I got 'em dirty dancin' in my mansion and my team lit
Yeah we popular, go check my fan-page

Sell my dues, bring the bottles to the crib
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib
We turnin' up, it's full throttle in this bitch
'Fuck is up with all these haters talkin' shit?
I just poured me up a cup
Call the plug and see what's up
Aye, I just poured me up a cup
Lemme show these haters up



Hahaha

Young Stoney, swangin', sippin' Remy
I just had the Henney, not the semi
Young Stoney, fuck the bitch, she in the Bentley
These bitches barkin' at the kennel
Kiss a elevator, bitch's levels
Blowin' gas when I'm pushin' on the pedal

I just came up, I ain't never coming down
Every time we pullin' up, we gon' shut this shit down
And I ride different, I stay sippin', my roof missing, that loud twistin'
I ride different, bitch I ride different

Couple aces in my hand, I ain't bluffin'
When I had nothin', ain't nobody give a shit
Man fuck off with that bullshit
Dab riggin' that toolkit
Hoes used to curve like there was new shit
Got bad hoes in my pool, shit

I just came up, I ain't never coming down
Every time we pullin' up, we gon' shut this shit down
And I ride different, I stay sippin', my roof missing, that loud twistin'
I ride different, bitch I ride different

Bitch I ride different
And I ride different, I ride different
My roof missing, I ride different
And I ride different, I stay sippin', my roof missing, that loud twistin'
I ride different

Six digits, bad bitches, they be dick-lickin'
Slick sippin' Pimp C with the limb missin'
Spend a grand on the shoes like my mind missing
Givenchy kicked up while I'm smokin' on Doja

Flight-club is swipe-club, I see it, I buy it
The Jordans, I wear that
Young Post, yeah, beware that
Volcano, prepare that
Hoes kicking it at the crib asking Malone
Uh, it keeps adding up
The money, oh God, it just keeps addin' up
The styrofoam cups always stay stackin' up
And you know that my team just gon' keep actin' up
You play me a song, please just give rappin' up
You talkin' that shit, boy, just keep that shit up
Find Post in the cut, prolly smokin' a blunt
I use all of this money to shit on you fucks
