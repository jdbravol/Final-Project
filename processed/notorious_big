Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed on Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap
I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' five carats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right, I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive

Representin' B-Town in the house
Junior Mafia, mad flavor
Uh, uh, yeah, a'ight

Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
It's all good
That's right, '94
And on and on, and on and on
Yeah…
Don't let 'em hold you downReach for the stars

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
"What's your name? What's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo?
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

Yeah, honey, check it—
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah… keep bangin'

Uh, check it out
Nine-fo' shit for that ass, uh
Puff Daddy, Biggie Smalls, Junior M.A.F.I.A
Represent—baby, baby, uh

Hello? Aw shit, nigga!
What the fuck time is it, man?
Oh goddamn, nigga!
Do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You a'ight?
Nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prob'ly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze until the bed's completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'

Please hang up, and try your call again
Please hang up—is a recording

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
"Never get high on your own supply"
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em "bounce!"
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say "hell no!"
Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

Crack King, Frank Wiz-zhite

1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5

Hah, sicker than your average
Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there e'ry night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underroos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas frontin', ain't sayin' nothin'
So I just speak my piece, keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
Packin', askin', "Who want it?"
You got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace
All Philly hoes go with Moschino
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie?
Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me

Escargot, my car go, one sixty, swiftly
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em with the force like Obi
Dick black like Toby
Watch me roam like Romey
Lucky they don't owe me

It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie…
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, get high…
Notorious thugs, gangstas…

Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed; no angel dust
Label us "Notorious thug-ass niggas
That love to bust," it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too
If you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through!
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like, nigga, move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
‘Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
"Cash Rules Everything Around Me"
Shit, lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes

7 AM, woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, nigga Dean
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam in between the scenes
Destroy your dreams; you willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand, one of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label – kick it, nigga!

Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag, ‘cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, your loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
But the Bone, not Leatherface
Too many are thinkin' they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch, if you steppin', we buckin' them guts – that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin', like, "Give me back me money!"
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor, but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now, who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Get high, get high, get high

Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead, but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic-status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue’s on my ass
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
‘Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one?
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
That red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
That red, red, rum…

As we proceed to give you what you need
9-5, motherfuckers
Get live, motherfuckers
Now turn the mics up
East Coast, motherfuckers
Turn that mic up
Bad Boy, motherfuckers
Yeah, that beat is knocking to that microphone
Turn that shit the fuck up
Uh, what? Turn it up louder, yeah, uh
J.M. motherfuckers

Who shot ya? Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets
It's on nigga, fuck all that bickering beef
I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek
Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school, new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn like "Disco Inferno"
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
Fucking with B.I.G. it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me two Glock 9s
Any motherfucker whispering about mines
And I'm Crooklyn's finest
You rewind this, Bad Boy's behind this

Get high, motherfuckers
Smoke blunts, motherfuckers
Ready to die, motherfuckers

I seen the light excite all the freaks
Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggas wanna creep, gotta watch my back
Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack?
I switches all that, cocksucker G's up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to TEC, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th Commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with nor see Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Puff Daddy flips daily
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
On the rocks, tote Glocks at christenings
Hammer cock, in the fire position and...

Open your fucking mouth, open your—didn't I tell you?
Can't talk with a gun in your mouth, huh?
Bitch-ass nigga, what? Who shot ya?

To give you what you need
Ready to die, motherfuckers, hah!
West Coast, motherfuckers
West Coast, motherfuckers, hah!
As we proceed, to give you what you need
Get money, motherfuckers
As we proceeeeeeed to give you what you need… 9-5

Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it level up
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, "There go Mase!", there go your cutie

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, "When all the ballin' stops?"
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A. be on your way
‘Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square

B-I-G P-O-P-P-A, no info for the DEA
Federal agents mad ‘cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin’
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5 double O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat

Yeah, mothafuckas better know
I'm a bad bad bad
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls

My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93

Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singing, it's so hard

Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

When he's sticking you and taking all of your money

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent

Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip

One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Before you find out how blue steel feel

From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it

Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers

So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too

Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet

Where?

In the Isuzu jeep

Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar

Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat

Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot

Oh shit the cops

Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts

So why the fuck he keep looking?

I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot

Take that motherfuckers

All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that mommy?

*beep*

Hi Daddy, how you doing, this is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night
Mm you actin' like you can't call me no more cause you busy n all that, but you trying to tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did!
I hooked you up with my girl and shit you fucked her every time you see her, you don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying!
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you, "why the fuck Big don't want me?"

Yo Big this is Quita, Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night, that's my best friend and we don't get down like that!

Yeah motherfucker this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me, you be disappearing and shit, and I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call alright?

When it comes to sex, I’m similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me "Bigga the Condom Filler"
Whether it’s stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I’m not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I’ll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don’t get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
I’m guaranteed to fuck her ’til her nose bleed
Even if your new man’s a certified mack

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?

Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn’t last
I’m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey’s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex -- and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I’m caressing 'em I’m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick and when I nut I got to split
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission
Fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain’t frontin’
They don’t call me big for nuttin’ all of a sudden

In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why?
It's my nigga, Pop, from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me cause now I'm warning you
I got the Mac, nigga tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor

Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you?
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming

Baby, look at me, Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now big, but I worry about you
I worry about you all the time, hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold on to that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doing tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage
The lyrically acclaimed
I like this young man, because when he came out
He came out with the phrase
He went from ashy to classy – I like that
So everybody in the house
Give a warm round of applause for the Notorious B.I.G
The Notorious B.I.G
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him y'all!

A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
The pin stripes and the gray, the one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside, I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch
88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks; pass the blunts!

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

I was a shame, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of them
Long as I got stuff from most of them
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fucking bitches, ain't my homegirls now
Start stacking, dabbled in crack, gun packing
Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my niñas
From gym class to English pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Getting larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no telling where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Praying God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Began to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college grant
So she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase "Sky's the limit"

Motherfuckers
See you chumps on top

I gots to talk
I gotta tell what I feel
I gotta talk about my life as I see it

Biggie
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you
This goes out to you, and you, and you

Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada, fuck Poppa
You got to call me Francis M.H. White
Intake light tokes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low and keep firin'
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip on that cat with that grip on rap
Ain't no telling where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecoming
With my man Capone, gumming, fucking something
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen before
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get - who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than "Great Adventure"

Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more

On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked for death
Should I start your breath or should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically I'm worshiped, don't front, the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishing, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them cause they nothing but dicks
Trying to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro, rock diamonds that's sick
Got paid off my flow, rhyme with my own clique
Take trips to Cairo, laying with your bitch
I know you praying you was rich, fucking prick
When I see ya I'mma

This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of N-Y
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya brailling it, snatch that light shit, I'm scaling it
Conscious of ya nonsense, in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, "Vigilante"
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my children
One shot they disappearin'
It's ill when MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragile, my nine milli
Make the whites shake, that's why my money never funny
And you still recouping, stupid stupid stupid stupid..

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't living so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
‘Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20 down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports ‘cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, ‘cause man…

I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland, with my man Two-TEC's to take over this projects
They call him Two-TEC's, he tote two TEC's
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally lounging, black
Sitting back, counting double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch, swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks, I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family; a true G, that's me
Blowing like a bubble in the everyday struggle

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'mma mould her now
Trick a little dough buying young girls fringes
Dealing with the dope fiend binges, seeing syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, bagging five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, mothafucka
Hah, come on, what you say?

Junior M.A.F.I.A. right
Yeah, rock on
Biggie Smalls, right
Junior M.A.F.I.A

The weak or the strong—who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

Relax and take notes
While I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor
The rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace," smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act, funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fist, like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rocked quick
I guess I was a combination
Of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humpin' around and jumpin' around
Jacked her, then I asked her, "Who's the man?"
She said, "B-I-G," then I bust in her E-Y-E

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave you toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC
G's disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies; no ifs, ands, or maybes
Hit Mommy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis, after she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with a ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with a broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin'
Horse's heads, human sacrifices
Cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals, havin' sex with 'em
Camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that; I kicked the habit
I just beat you to death
With weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket
I'm lyin', I got a 9 in my pocket
And, baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords
For any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours; yeah, you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door
I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor
Get a new whore, met on the second, wed on the third
Then she's dead on the fourth; I'm dead wrong

Who y'all talkin to man?
Check it out, check it out
This here goes out
To all the niggas that be fuckin mad bitches
In other niggas cribs
Thinkin shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it, check it

I kick flows for ya, kick down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin hoes for ya
Niggas think Frankie pussy whipped, nigga picture that
With a Kodak, Insta-ma-tak
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
Sweetness, where you parked at?
Petiteness but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that, I'm fuckin with you
The bitch official doe, dick harder than a missile yo
Try to hit, if she trippin disappearin like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a connivin stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'm a peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Television's, Versace heaven, when I'm up in em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressin me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin' 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past
She came twice I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, sayin' "I'm smokin' on home-grown"
Then I heard the moan, "honey I'm home!"
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad I know he won't like this
Now I'm like, "Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him, arm, leg."
She beggin me to stop but this cat gettin closer
Gettin hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, uhh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, "Honey bring me up somethin to drink!"
He go back downstairs more time to think
Her brain racin, she's tellin me to stay patient
She don't know I'm, cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will though, I probably chill though
Even though situation lookin' kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, "Gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope."
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, "Don't blast here's the stash
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!"
Nigga pullin mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggas on the cell
"Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uhh"

Yo let—let—let me ask you a question yo
Yo, would you kill for me?
Hmmm... yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, uh, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch

But you know you love that ass, don't you?
Yeah, no question
No question
Yo, let me ask you another question
What?
You been fuckin' 'round on me?
Why would I do that?
Yo, don't lie to me motherfucker

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Just me and my bitch, yeah

Let me tell you nigga, if I ever
Ever catch your ass fuckin' around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin' dick off
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
Yo, don- don't play with my dick

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch

Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh

So when did you first start rappin'?
Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18…
So how did you first get started? Who influenced you?
I see. So where you from?
Brooklyn

I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold and that, what you talkin' bout Willis
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless, guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze Gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me
You don't want to fuck with the M-E...

...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga, you won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on, bitch

Meth-tical, putting niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch

Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the Winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so

Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique in full effect
Bedford–Stuyvesant the livest one
My borough is thorough, recognize

I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

Party and bullshit
And party and bullshit

Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll, see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping
Ain't no stopping Big Poppa
I'm a Bad Boy
It ain't hard to tell I'm the East Coast overdose
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling "Yo chill, man, chill!")

Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that...

Party and bullshit, and party ...

Junior M.A.F.I.A. like to...
Uptown likes to...
Bad Boy likes to...
Brooklyn Crew likes to...
3rd Eye likes to...
Mo Bee likes to...
We like to...

Damn, is that the Chronic?
Yeah, it's that chronic boy

So you wanna be hardcore with your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who, says me the lyrical
Niggas saying, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glockses
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this?
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot, don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
What's love got to do?
When I'm ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life
Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain

"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like ’cause they don't get nathan
But penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like Island Carpet
Stop it - if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, gon' see my guns—get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell is stopping ya
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I'm in—game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back, I get
Deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break

Baby, here I am
All, I need is one more chance! One more chance
I can help you find, yourself
Cause you, don't need nobody else!
One more chance

She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl around me!
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through can you sing the song for me boo

So what's it gonna be? Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion - flying into all states
Sexing me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the player President

Charli Baltimore, Iceberg Slim
The most shady, Frank Baby
Uh-uh, uhh

Ha ha ha ha ha, check out this bizarre
Rapper style used by me, the B.I.G
I put my ki - you put your ki in, money we'll be seein'
Will reach the fuckin' ceiling, check-check it
This instant, rappers too persistent
Quick to spit Biggie name on shit, make my name taste
Like ass when you speak it, see me in the street
Your jewelry? You can keep it, that be our little secret
See me, B that is, I that is, G whiz
Motherfuckers still in my biz
Y'all got the gall, all I make is one phone call
All y'all disappear by tomorrow
All your guns is borrowed, I don't feel sorrow
Actually, your man passed the Gat to me, now check this

What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 30 deep
Guaranteed to be in ICU

I done smoked with the best of em
Shot at the rest of em
Was about a hundred or more...maybe less of em
Got my rocks off, that nigga from the Brook just be
Wilin' on you, just be stylin' on you
When I, tried to warn you but your eyes fucked up
Now I cleared them shits with hits you on the fucking bench
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kind of
Peeved at these weak MC's with the
Supreme ballerlike lyrics. I call em like I see em, G
Y'all niggas sound like me
Y'all was grimy in the early 90s, far behind me
It ain't hard to find me, number one with the "booyaka"
Give me the Remy and the chronic, ain't no telling what I do to ya
It's obvious the game's new to ya
Take them ends you make
And spend em on a tutor hah, one shot, I'm through with ya

There'll be nothin' but smooth sailing
When I spit shots, now your crew's bailing
All I got is heat and tough talk for you
Tie you up, cut your balls off just to use
Man, listen, straight torture
Look what that slick shit bought ya
A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Christopher
Watch me set it off like Vivica
Here lies your demise, close your eyes
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten
It's bad cause I just begun
What make the shit real bad
I was havin' fun

Yeah, you ready motherfucker?
We gonna kill your ass

As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The Q-45, Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die!

As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sewed
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready

I'm ready to die!

Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet
We gonna make you suffer

In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking
You better act like CeCe and keep on walking
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, with stompin'
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking cheek drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die!

I'm ready
Niggas definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
For ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready!

Yeah

Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil -- for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun-testing, coke-measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spending chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
6 up in your wig-piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
There's my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying -- no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody til somebody kills you

You're nobody, til somebody, kills you

Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
3 of mine dead, nothing left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed
Incidents like this I take trips
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet em in the future later, they'll take me shopping
Buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Rich bitch shit, drinking Cristal
Til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too

You can be the shit, flash the fattest 5
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name, you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Getting his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?"
A fucking shame, dude's the lame, what's his name?
Darkskin Jermaine, see what I mean?

"Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell them Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies, kill them and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this, Frank
Them cats we fucking with put bombs in your mom's gas tank"
"Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn them with dirty .380s
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear them all out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fucking real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, 14,5 a piece
Enough to cop a 6, buy the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody getting cream no one considered a leech
I kill them all I'll be set for life", "Frank, pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em", "I promise"
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands, while he just deciding
I'd rather go toe-to-toe with all of y'all
Running ain't in my protocol

Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tuscon, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin, chose not the moves wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks caught a Jooks
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back, speaking Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
He's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything to gain, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money you dying
'Specially if my daughter crying, I ain't lying
Y'all know the science

We agreed to go in shooting is silly
Because niggas could be hiding in showers with Mac-millis
So I freaked them, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
Peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place -- long story. Glo' seen't my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was coming for the safe
Now she breaking, "Shut up, 112, what's shaking?"
"A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
And a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need"
"Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we about to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice"
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Fuck it, it's flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waiting patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blasting
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughing, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast
She crying, head shots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothing but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dipping
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flipping, pistol gripping, I load the clip in
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers

Yo Big, wake up, wake up baby
Mmm, yo...
Yo Big, wake yo' ass up c'mon
I'm up! I'm up. I'm up , I'm up
Big, wake up!
I'm up Diddy, what the fuck, man? What's up?
Yo Big, Big, Big
Yo take down this information
Ain't no pen
Tell your girl then to remember it or somethin'. Can you do that?
Aight honey, yeah write this down
Aight, uhm, flight five-oh-four
Five-oh-four
Leaving Kennedy
Kennedy
On the L-A-X
Oh! Cali?
No doubt baby, you know we gotta get this paper
Ahh, no doubt, aight
You aight?
I'm up, I'm up
Yo Big
I'm up, man
Flight five-oh-four
California

When the la-la hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
Either I'm with ya or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talking to the rap inventor
Nigga with the game tight, fifth of that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Getting head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed - sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see one
Sipping on booze in the House of Blues

If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breast in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving LA props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
Beeper start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco

Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light
I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it 'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite
Cali, great place to visit

See I told ya'll
I told ya’ll motherfuckers
I told ya’ll to stop
I prayed for you to stop
But you didn’t stop
And then we won’t stop

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight

I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low though"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Blood rushin', concussions, ain't nothin
Catch cases, come out fronting, smokin somethin
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
Long kiss

Hell, we don’t give a fuck
We just absolutely don’t give a fuck because
There ain’t no love here
You know, we gon' keep doin' what we do
We gon' keep fuckin' you up
I’ll be stomping your motherfucking head in, you fucking bitch

Uhh.. I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at, these fucking
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleeding lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryin to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin' out -- the block
For distances, givin' long kisses BITCH!

Only understand, I say a prayer for you
You know, that’s the only thing I can do, just pray for your mind
Because, see, your mind is in control of your heart
Where its supposed to be the other way around
Your heart has got to control your mind
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cold

Frank White the menacing, Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
This brolic, alcoholic
Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid
Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
Sling steel slow, as for remorse, we feel no

See the fucked up thing is that I love you
You know what I’m saying
It’s just in my nature to love you
I can’t hate you
‘Cause its not in my nature to hate you
You know, I don’t know
Maybe I’m a different type of individual
But you have me on a line
And there’s a thin line between love and hate
And God-forbid I cross that line
Cause I’m not gon’ give a fuck
I’m telling you right motherfucking now
The shit that ya’ll done started
Is never gonna stop!
We are never gonna stop!
And we’re not talking about no other rappers
We’re talking about you, motherfucker!
You know who I’m talking to
We comin' for you
Laughs
Feels so good
I'ma make you love me baby, baby

Biggie Smalls is the illest

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my bathroom fucking
It ain't nothing
They know BIG be handling
With the Mac in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's
Oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q -
45 by my side
Lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast you but I have to
You see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame
And them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot, Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable

It's unbelievable

B-I-G, G-I-E
A.K.A., B.I.G
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep
Need sleeping
Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking
Casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
That's that "Oh I, thought he was wack"
Oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté
I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented
Car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil, or unbelievable

Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus coupes
Leave no witnesses
What you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here
I damage and tear
MC's fear me
They too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Cazal shades and corn braids
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews, hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Toting Tecs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Wait for niggas to step up on some fighting shit
We get hype and shit and start lighting shit
So step away with your fist-fight ways
Motherfucker, this ain't back in the days
But you don't hear me though

No more coco-levio 1, 2, 3
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seeing bodies with the motherfucking chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrapping
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eating 5 cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Going out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the 9 and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts
Every time I turn around, a nigga getting took out
Shit, my Momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed

Uh, I like that, you like that?
Here's another one, and another one
And another one, and another one

And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight
Uh, Here's another one
And another one
Uh, uh, what

Some say the X, make the sex Spec-tacular
Make me lick you from yo' neck to your back, then ya
Shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean
But tonight, no ends

What! What!
You must be used to me spending
Uh, uh

Girl you look fine
Like a wide face Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My style genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with your fuckin' limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo' chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mami
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love makin', strictly back breakin'
Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, Shark Bar, uh-uh
Strictly sex that's sweaty and leftover spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Dom P's
But tonight it's eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that

Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
You must be used to me

Let's stop the bullshit, baby
Let me take you to the spot, fit you hot

Fuckin' you baby, I'm fuckin' you baby
Matter what you ma'am say, babe
Givin' it to you, any way I possibly can
Should I? , I may

Cuh dis ah 94' when ah RAA fi kill people and kyaan dun
Nuh waan pussy hole hold di kaanah
Watch this, lawd

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Nineteen-seventy something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Peep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm pimping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

Now this is Diana King doing a Yankee thing
In a Biggie Small's thing, do it, Ja!
Have Mercy!
The gunman in all de party
And everybody feel irie
And everybody just follow me, follow me, follow me!
The wul ah we in ah de party
And everybody look irie
Now di man them sexy, sexy, sexy
Do it!

No mercy fuh nuh big up unnu self
Hardcore thing we ah deal with
Oh yes, we are the best
No other guy cyaan test

Shit mami, damn, why you actin like that man?
'Cause I don't be doin' this
I'm sayin', you know it ain't nothin'
It's just part of sex, ya know'm saying
But you know I don't do this, I don't even know how to do this
I'm just sayin', jus-just a little peck mami, for daddy
Just a little peck
Like that?
That's what I'm sayin', yeah
You know I don't be doin' this though tho', you know that
Whatever bitch, damnit

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?

Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

Nigga was Motherfuckin' hyped up
Nigga just grabbed a nigga and snuffed a nigga
And it was on from there wasn't nothing stopping him holmes
Them motherfuckers was ready for anything
Them niggas was packing burners, niggas ready to fight with them
Niggas doing what they had to do holmes
Niggas on the real flip mode holmes
Niggas coming out like a motherfucker
Niggas was ancy like come on, come on, motherfuckers

Come on, motherfuckers, come on

Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the forehead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'mma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'mma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock
I'mma tell them, "It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit"
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga

Ah, ah! I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Learjets and coupes
I gets up quick, cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walk in
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it! I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip, nigga! Is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
Cause I'm a criminal way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit; Puff won't even know what happened
If it's done smoothly, silencers on the Uzi
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinnin', reminiscin' 'bout my man C-Rock

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Let the gunshots blow
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo ass in the midst, kid

Fillin' clips, he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'
"Some kid named Jason, in a Honda station wagon
Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew 'round the time I was locked up with you"
"True indeed"
"But yo nigga, let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high, give them bullets room to breathe
Damn, it was our year
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home and Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white
He figured Roc set 'em up, no question
Wet em up no less than 50 shots in his direction"
"How many shots?" "Man nigga, I seen mad holes"
"What kinda gats?" "Hecklers, Kochs, and Calicos
But fuck that, I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin' hustlin' and they don't be strapped
Supreme in black is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in, and c'mon if you're comin'

Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gonna go down?
Lay these niggas low-down
"Slow down, ah, fuck all that plannin' shit
Run up in they cribs and make the cats abandon ship!"
See niggas like you do ten-year bids
Miss the niggas they want and murder innocent kids
Not I, one nigga's in my eye, that's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
"Pass the chocolate, Thai!"
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin'
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter

As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
Them jeans they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses, I'mma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimping ain't easy but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun?

Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying

I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly ass Xscape bitches
You can 76 the 69, try 68
Make Raven-Symoné call date rape
Only cause Im paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
"Everybody move your body"
Got Whitney Houston boosting from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Backshots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fucking En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
If that bitch give me action...guaranteed satisfaction

We push the hottest V's, peel fast
Through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be shaking they sadiddy ass
And Prada be something you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Being broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan
Scope the spot out, see something nice and I'm gone
You cats is home screaming the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watching Tyson
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playing right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles, bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flight mileage

I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

I'm popping Magnums while Jigga bag something
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CDs and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jesús, dipped to H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in the beards and moustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
On the Range, way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachel
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, "Ewww!"
Still tote steel, I'm trying to see five mil off the single, for real
You ain't fazing the amazing
While your gun's raising, mine is blazing
See you on see me all talking to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocka, Roc-a-Fella, Bad Boy collabo
Two MCs with mad dough, you know

Miraculous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull cause we matadors
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers
And we clap the doors of your Acuras
Snap like cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like The Beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all
Too bad for y'all
Ain't too many as bad as yours truly
Do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all

We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq
Country house, tennis courts on horseback
Riding, deciding cracked crab or lobster
Who say mobsters don't prosper?
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars
Me I'm critically acclaimed, slug passed your brain
Reminisce on dames whose coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile every time he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfielders
Half these rapping cats ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make 'em dash like Dame

Ladies and gentlemen!

I go on and on and on and
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "But I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
I threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

Gotta love my lil' nasty girl
Know I love my lil' nasty girl
I love my lil' nasty girl
All the ladies if you feel me grab your titties for B-I-G
My lil' nasty girl
All my women from around the world

You know I like nasty girls...
I need you to dance, I need you to strip
I need you to shake your lil' ass and hips
I need you to grind like you workin' for tips
And gimme what I need while we listen to Prince
Cause miss you ain't seen the world yet, rocked La Perla yet
Rocked them pearl sets, flew in a pearl jet
My style make a low profile girl smile
And now you and me can drink some Hennessy
Then we get it on
Made women wantin' to bone Sean Combs, sippin' on Patron
Speedin' be leanin' got 'em fiendin'
Lift your shirt, you know how I flirt

We're a Man lookin'no stress
Meet us upstairs in ya best, yes!
Dress, to impress, spark this bitch's intrest
Jazzy on the beat so sweet
Ladies if ya feel me grab ya titties for B-I-G

Okay ma, what's ya preference
Nice and slow or fast and reckless
Pull your hail girl, bite cha necklace!
I make ya sprang a leak
I'm like the radical one
I vibrate a lil' more than your mechanical one
Either way mama I'mma make you do what it do
Guaranteed when you fuckin wit me

Cause I'll go on and on and on
On and on and on
On and on
Ladies if you feel me, grab them thangs for Biggie

All the women from around the world

Ladies & gentlemen you are now in tune into the very best
Jazzy Fizzle... Nelly man, Jagged Edge
The Notorious... NOTORIOUS! B-I-G
THE BIGGIE DUETS! NOTORIOUS!
BAD BOY! SHO NUFF SHO NUFF!
NOTORIOUS!
Ladies & Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen...
LET'S GO!

*phone rings*
*heavy breathing*
Motherfucker *click*
Kill you motherfucker
I'm gonna get you motherfucker you better watch your motherfuckin back
That's my word nigga
Better watch your motherfuckin back
I'm gonna get Biggie, I'm gonna kill Biggie
Fuck all you niggas, you all ain't SHIT
Watch your motherfuckin back
*click*

Jealousy's a motherfucker, you weak jealous motherfuckers!
If you a jealous motherfucker, you just a weak motherfucker!
See when you on top, motherfuckers just wanna bring you down!
Motherfuckers don't even know you, and they don't like you

I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set off
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-lyn
Army fatigues bring fatigue, to enemies, look man
You wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crouched up over the casket, screaming "bastard"
Crying, know my friends is lying
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugers from they Rugers
Or their Desert, dying ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me
Sorta like Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreaming
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team and
Be more gone than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers
Specialize in killing wives and grandmothers
Who ya trusting, shit
When Frank start busting, Frank start somethin
Killing ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs taking broads home
On the phone with the chip, these Cristal chicks
Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit

We used to hold the gold, now we floss with diamonds
Niggas want my team to stop shining
Pray my fame start declining
We been around the world twice, all we got is mo' ice
And mo' nice, sacrifice your heart
Lexus with the automatic start
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eating shrimp a la carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eating clams and mussels
Octopus, pretty face no waist
I just want the bush, so I can mack it
Give her a package to push, cause I work them hoes
Pendejos I show you how to play them hoes
Can you just visualize it
Before I go to sleep I check the beds and the closet
So I can sleep safe, not too many keep a mill' in the briefcase
Infrareds help me sleep safe, but wait

See, y'all motherfuckers live off of negativity
What y'all niggas need to get through your motherfucking heads
Is that, y'all fucking with some niggas that's on a higher
Motherfucking level -- we don't give a fuck
About what you think about us how you feel about us
What you got to say about us
We gon keep doing our motherfuckin thing
From now till the year three thousand bitches!
You can't breathe, you can't sleep, you can't eat
Without thinking about us!
And without thinking about us on your mind
We gon' haunt your asses motherfuckers!

Uh yeah, Bad Boy baby
Ralph Tresvant
Listen...

Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' "Ay papi!"
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Gettin' Physical like Olivia Newt
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

Bitches screamin' they want that old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
With some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin' in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love and hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to come the ghetto is crazy
How come you and your sis make similar faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin' how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...

Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
I don't chase em, I replace em
And if I'm caressin' em, I'm undressin' em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin' for an intermission
Fuck the kissin', lickin' down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin, all of a sudden

P. Diddy y'all
Bad Boy for life
Once again going to the top baby

Fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my niggas know
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin scandalous-ass bitches; you know how it go, Gooch
I meet a bitch, fuck a bitch
Next thing you know you fuckin the bitch
You just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit
Fuck 'em

Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?)
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch

You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see

Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I know
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just trying to be all I can be

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore, she be game for sure
Pimp so hard a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me, that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it
See, you hit it then I hit it. We get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga, we be flying through your hood
And hood rats scoping with their eyes on my goods
See, we date em like we hate em, see em like we don't need em
Treat em like we beat em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you never knew what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible, fuck the nigga next to you

"When the Remy's in the system, ain't no telling
Will I fuck him? Will I diss him?" That's what these hoes yelling
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase em, I'll replace em
Drunk off Dom, silk and gators
Spitting words, make a bird tell they flock see you later
Whether drunk or high, skunk or Thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon' fly
Ain't gon' lie, pimped out her SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o - she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew in each state
Now I got 2 in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models
Larger stakes on large estates

I had a whole lot of bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game, always say the right lines
Had a few prostitutes, and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you!
She ain't no sucker. I know that bitch, man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman loving a rich man
Now here you come, drop top riding
You ain't no pimp, fake nigga, stop lying
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that lived it
Street life, pimp shit, make the ho respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick, that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figure
She left you cause you couldn't be like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average simps, found a badder pimp

Crazy ass man
I never would have bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that ho, man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the ho!
Man I'm 30 years old, nigga
And that bitch was hoin' when I was in 9th grade and shit
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' with you cause you had a good ass job, nigga
Nerd...treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga. She ain't nothing but a ho!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a ho into a housewife, fool
Every time you turn your back, that bitch is fuckin' with them gangstas
Eastside, Westside - these are my partners
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin' bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man, yeah I know a few, shit
Beyotch!

Notorious
Grab your gat
Call your clique
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip

Spit your game, talk your shit, Grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks
Pass that weed I gotsta light one

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins, and violins
We just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew, what this game'll do to you
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Sure caught beef with you know who
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick, cause

Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
All them niggas I got ta fight one
All them hoes I got ta like one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?

Making money, living marvelous
In God we trust
Don't too many niggas wanna start with us
Got big guns in the cars with us
Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us
They really wanna show you what a G.I.B
I'd rather be sipping Remy in V.I.P
We can hear the music and that'll be by me
Brooklyn to K-Town, when you checking out the flow
You know it's gon' reign with persistence
Two legends on the same track, two different planes of existence
Let's get it cracking, I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back cause I love to fuck ho
Do it for the city, I love Chicago
You think you could spit on the mic like you Biggie and flow just as steady as I
Shit, it's real, you know you love em, you ain't got Ready To Die
Life After Death, give it to you however you want it nigga
Got it, they got ya, give it to you, however you want it nigga, Huuuu
Cause the shit it get deep
So I carry big heat
Screaming "come and get me"
Free mils, I love to make one
All these cars, I love to ride one
All these hoes, I love to cut one
A tribute to Big, I love to bust one

In the middle of it I'mma
Bring niggas more drama then they baby mamas
Nigga wanna battle I'mma bomb ya
One man, but attack like a pack of piranhas
Like terracotta, niggas always ready for the war
But they really don't wanna see a nigga though
We can get em in a minute then we finish with the venom of the rhythm of a nigga with a sick-o-flow
Doing it with Swizz, oh no!
You niggas is in some trouble
Nigga y'all heard of me
Wig splitter, killer nigga, word to me
And I'm classic like Bird and Magic with a tactic to snatch his rep back and stack some platinum
Dumping on them at random
With the bullets I brand them
I'm heavily heated, it's easy to see me

You just heard the sounds of the King of New York
There's only one crown

Uuh, yeah, uh, oooh, oh yeah, mmm, yeah
Oh fuck me you black mothafucka, oooohh yeah!!! MMMMMM, Aaahhh
Oh fuck me you black Kentucky Fried Chicken eatin'
Ohhh, ooohhh, yeah
You mothafuckin' gangsta killin', mutha fuckin black mafia ass
Muthafuckin, you, ohhhhh my god
You chronic smokin', Oreo cookie eatin', pickle juice drinkin'
Chicken gristle eatin', biscuit suckin', MUTHAfucka
V8 juice drinkin', slim fast, blendin' black greasy muthafucka
OOOHHHHH

Biggie!

Oh yeah

The motherfuckin shit just get me so motherfuckin' mad
‘Cause, you know, that was my nigga, you know
I knew the shit was 'bout to go down
And my man was like hyping me
Me and O be together, and the nigga be like
"Watch, I'm telling you when my man get on, it's gonna be some shit, we ain't gonna have to sell this shit no mo'
That shit fucked me up ,man
That was my motherfuckin' heart

Yeah, dedicating this to my nigga O
We miss you, nigga
Going out to all the young niggas that died in the struggle
Word up, shit is real in the field
You know, sparkin' blunts to all you niggas; word up

Each and every day
The daydreams of how we used to be
See your family
And that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away?
I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're going through, oh yeah

I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, reigned on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin
In '88, when Kane ruled with "Half Steppin'"
A .38, a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings till the D's crept in; and now I'm missing 'em

Ooh, I'm missin' you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why

We work all week, weekends we play the movies
We rocked flatops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin', even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me
Fuck it! Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops coming, sick of throwing jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em "Go that route!"
Few months, he got his brain blown out, now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy; you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in N.Y.?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I'd look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye; damn, I'm missin' him

There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin', but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin' with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby 'fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheating
Now Drew, she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived – what my baby had to die for? Missin' her

Beeotch!
Talk about these hoes Big..

I got a bitch that suck my dick til I nut
Spit it on my gut and slurp that shit back up
Fuck for bout a hour, now she want a golden shower
Recognize G, straight up, I can't knock ya
After Big Poppa, fuck ALL of Junior M.A.F.I.A
The whole clique, dick sucked, ass licked
Leave your number by the phone, bring yo' ass on home
I roam in Lexuses and Benzes, the fly way
My way deep throat on Luke's boat
Just the way players play
Sucked all day, smokin blunts, countin cheese
Fucking bitches til they assholes bleed
What you say ba-by

"Don't take em to the crib unless they bonin"

Uhh.. uhh..
Biggie bag bitches from barbecues to barmitzvah's
I'm feelin kinda itchy for a quickie
Don't take off your coat, all you got to do is lick me
Me eat you, I beat you, then greet you to the door bitch
Cause I don't love you no more
Which one of these hoes in the lobby wanna slob me?
You know me, I like my dick Brown like Bobby
In the duke shoot, then the bitch get the boot
Unless she lick ass and blow dicks like flutes
I like em cute, round tits and fat asses
Educated, so I can bust off on they glasses
I wanna cum on your tongue and gums, all night
The bitch drink nuts by the pint

Drink it bitch!
All of these hoes do that shit

It's after midnight, it's time to come up
Fuckin with some sluts tryin to bust a nut
I ain't seen this many hoes in a long time
But it's gettin kinda late, and I cain't wait
Bitch fuck a first date
I pulled out my dick, she called me rude..
Then she noticed the limp and the whip
Recognize game, you've been pimped by a pimp
Throw all that trick shit, out the window
You come up short tryin to doubt the pimp ho
Too $hort baby, straight from Oakland
Ho money is my fix and I can't be broken
Freak bitches all on my dick

Tell you anything you wanna hear right about now
To the spot, that's where we goin baby
See we goin to the spot
Do our thang like we always do
You ain't know?

Yo, check it, Call Lil' Cease
Tell that muh'fucker to bring me some muh'fuckin weed for this hospital
Man fuck that
Tell that reporter to go pick up ten thousand from Dez
And go take about like twenty G's from Gino
Tell that muh'fucker get this nigga next door up out of here
Call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick

The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin me
Sayin the best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast, and givin me a sponge bath
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga I'm gettin high, gettin head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
All the time, Big Poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

C'mon.. we are, we are
NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!
He is.. he is..

This for my niggas slingin thangs, had my ring encaged
Truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
For the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
That shit with the V-trim that win
And the enormous fields disperse of rap
On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggas to kill, than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
Hops, out the truck like, "Trick, what up?"
That's the end of us, get your friend to fuck
Funny how quick these pricks forget
Actin like I ain't the reason they traded they shit
It's all good, you know who the clone is
Fuck the Joneses, niggas tryin to keep up with the Combses

C'mon y'all..

Who that queen bitch, keep her glass filled to the rim?
That's me, on MTV, no doubt
Titty out like what - I don't give a fuck!
Y'all know my attitude, can't stand my cologne
Then stay your ass home, you and your chaperone
Things done changed, but we continue to reign
As the King and the Queen of hip-hop, me and B.I
Sexy, young thing, from the ghetto
That bitch rockin mics in high heel stilletos
We takin over like Francis
Switchin our styles like the hottest new dances
See, I let y'all live to stack a LITTLE paper
Be glad I pushed my album back, I did y'all hoes a favor!

She did you a favor, c'mon now, yeah
Bad Boy baby, D.R. c'mon
We are, we are ..
Queen Bee baby, we are, c'mon
Bad Boy 2000
And he won't stop
Cause he can't stop, yeah, uh-huh
He is, he is..
We are...

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
Do you cut that hooker off and find someone new

Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you would be the right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, when she beep you, don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We'll be all fucking tonight, knahmean?!", uhh

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
'Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho
Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh
What about the fight in The Mirage
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Q.B. hanged like plaques on the wall with your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat of the Nautica Jeep
We've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', "Kim you need to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' bout the bitches I fought over you
Nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach

Can I live til my last day
Hittin honies that be na-sty
Gettin money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

Yo what's beef to you, three niggas with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The LOX get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
LOX and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggas under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, Sheek Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all

You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kickin the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam, the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
LOX and Poppa,turning niggas into Jim Hoffa
Who gon' stop us? Your last joint double copper
You gettin money or your runnin from the Feds
Ain't nothing over here but 16 with one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggas out there got a problem this year

Before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deep and you drown
With no soul, many niggas roll with no dough
Even the small gun got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
Niggas is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to blame
There's a lot of dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better give with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes devised, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind thug'll fall in love with a whore

Uhh, uhh, uhh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin
Analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shine to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need four mo'

Yeahh, worrd
I remember I met this one bitch
Cause you know me I don't see how I'm the nasty motherfucker
I meets this one bitch, I comes up in the spot, or whatever
The bitch got the candles lit or whatever, so
She tell me whatever she wanna get her freak on whatever
So I'm like WHASSUP whatchu wanna yaknahmsayin
Ya know shit I was like whatchu mean shit?
I mean I might shit on you after I, hit it I won't call you no more
She talkin about no she want me to cock over her
I said bitch what the, what the fuck??
What the fuck I'm sposed to do after I after I shit on her
I'm sposed to hit that after that?
She's just wilding out so after I shits on the bitch right
Ya know I shit, after I shits on the bitch
The bitch, ya know, washed that shit off or whatever

This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Representin on the freaky freaky
Fuck em all day fuck em all night
We don't love these hoes

Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin'
Easy, call em on the phone and
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O
She starts off, "Well I don't usually"
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work

You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin for the semen
Me bein the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron'chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfying all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What?

Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you're fat
Keep a gat cause cats try to test me
They just fans like DeNiro/Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal till she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, iceberg apparel
Call me Cease cause I keep em, we can go freakin
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin? Uhh

"Well it's the Funk Docta Spock.."
"Meth-Tical.."

Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high

Yo.. yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggas since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high

"Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin" -
"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.." -
"Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon" -

Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off "Get Money", "Player's Anthem"
Don't forget, "One More Chance" and, my other hits, other shit
Niggas spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
In and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer

Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
That's infinity -- too many sick niggas, nickel nines;
Bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
And three charges, I got to "See-three-P.O.'s"
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggas swingin swords in the WAR
That's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie? The Notorious
Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador

Good evening, and for my last hit
I'd like to take you back to the classic
A-hem, B.I.G. style of course, uhh

Lay on the ground, you've been robbed
Lay on the floor, you've been robbed, uhh

You know, we need this money
And you, yes baby, you, should just roll with me
Let's go off, together
On this robbin' spree, we'll make money, uhh

Take off that crown, you've been robbed
Don't cry no more, you've been robbed

You see, there are two kinds of people in the world today
We have the playas, and we have the playa haters
Please don't hate me because I'm beautiful baby

Hear what they talk, about me
But my crew so deep
You can't do, a damn thing, to me

Lay on the floor, you've been robbed
You fuckin fools, you've been robbed, uhh
This is a robbery, nigga

Playa hater
Thank you thank you far too kind, far too kind
Thank you, thank you very much

*Curtis Mayfield - "Super Fly" plays over this*

*Sugarhill Gang - "Rapper's Delight" fades in*

God damnit Voletta, what the fuck are you doin?
I just saw Mr. Johnson, he told me he caught the motherfucking boy shoplifting
You can't control the god, I don't know what the fuck to do with that boy
If if you can't fucking control him
Bitch, what I say, I'mma send his motherfuckin ass to a group home goddamnit, what?
I'll smack the shit outta you bitch
Motherfucker, you are fucking up

*Sugarhill Gang - "Rapper's Delight" fades out*

We need to get some motherfuckin paper nigga
All you motherfuckers get on the fuckin floor! *blam blam*
Get on the motherfucking floor!

1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somthin'

1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
No spouse in the house, so she rolls herself
Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."

I remmember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
Let me take you back in time
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse, that I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum

Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

And I knew that I was going somewhere
Ooooh, oooooh

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up north, bound first stop for the town
Of Fishkill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-Hah! Yo G, pass the buddha

Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

The hotel guest that you have called is unreachable
You may leave a private recorded message at the tone or press zero and a hotel operator will assist you
You may start your message now press zero to return to the attendant
Ayo big whats up men its Shawn men heard you are in miami boy give me a call i got some bitches men i got eight bitches
I got some crony i got some kid that looks crib nigga that nigga ain't goina be here for two weeks hit me up nigga hit me up its shawn its shawn

Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
That's the one I gotta get with

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

She said "If I get with you
I gotta get witcha whole hood rat crew, whatcha I think I do?
Sling skins for a living,my name ain't November
This ain't Thanksgiving, you ain't Michael Bivins
Mack it up, flip it, rub it down
Do me baby, I ain't down
My name ain't 2Pac I don't "Get Around"
You hitting this nigga, how that sound?"
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

Can I get witcha..
Cause I got a big B-U-T, T, see

I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said "I don't care, so don't be acting silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, "I wanna get freaky with you"
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you
Michelle I'm glad I met you
You make the head feel special
Now I know it's official
That I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh

Bad Boy in the house for the '95
Big shout out to my man Mel Smith, my man Don Cee San in the house
What's up Michelle Ray, what's up boo?

Sick of mama screaming that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in a hooptie
Whispered in his ear "This is what we got to do, G"
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby-mama screaming "Your daughter 12 months"
Can't live life slinging rocks and smoking blunts
Hanging wit the niggas don't pay the bills
And being broke at 30 give a nigga the chills
So what we gotta do is creep and see a sweet vic
Columbian, Dominican, yeah whatever
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys, 20 G's, nigga please
Blew his brains out cause witnesses we don't leave

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing

After mad blunts and gin we had the plan made
I bought my wifey a crib, I bought the MAFIA an arcade
A little extra chicken loot be comin in handy
Check it, got on some '95 shit, sold the 5 bought the 6
Delvecc, copped the lex, we was set
Nino had work all in the projects
Niggas slingin O's he kept the profit, no one could stop it
We was livin it up
All the sexy young bitches ain't stressin givin it up
Same bitches suckin' dick tryin' their best to thrill me
Said the niggas I killed is out to kill me
Soon as she spoke, on that note I saw trenchcoats
One had a mac spittin', all I saw was gun smoke
The other had a shottie, I was shootin' everybody
And I wasn't missing, had to get out this position
Niggas still hitting, feel the hot ones in my back
Licked six shots, smoked the nigga wit the mac
The nigga wit the shottie still busting, cussing
Maricons and putas
All I'm tryin to do is shoot ya, two shots in the ruger
Booh-yeah, blew his ass out

Bad Boy in the house, for the '95 peace
Real niggas, aight

Yo check it
Call Lil Cease, tell that motherfucker to bring me some motherfucking weed to this hospital
Tell that motherfucker to get this nigga next door up out of here, that nigga be snoring all night I can't sleep
And call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick

But the nurses is lovin' me
Saying the best part of the day is my half
Feedin' me breakfast and givin' me a sponge bath
Nigga, I'm getting high getting head on the beach
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks
Any repurcussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips
All the time, Big Poppa kick the raw rhyme

Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing

Previously on Ready to Die

... me and her sister had something going on
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
*BANG*

*heartbeat slows, sound of ambulance sirens*
*sound of pulse monitor and breathing machine*

Damn... we was s'pose to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable!
The shit can't be over, no
The shit can't be over, man
I know you hear me nigga
I know you hear me
You got too much livin' to do
Too much unfinished business
It ain't over
*flatline*
Live your life

Yeah, ninety-six, for my Nostrand Ave niggas
Dangerous MC's

Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Oooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is...

Y'all niggas know the rules
I blast on niggas so --

-- my fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TaaDow!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, phrase raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches

C'mon, yo, throw your hands, c'mon
Bitch grab your tits, c'mon
Let me know you in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon
Thugs tote yo' shit
We bout to get mo' rich, c'mon
Let's blow the club, c'mon
Fuck the place up, c'mon
Shake yo' nasty ass
And make it swing all around, c'mon
Yo, make this money
Throw yo' loot on the ground, c'mon
Bounce in your whips, c'mon
Bitch lick yo' lips, c'mon
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon

Uh-huh, make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chickenhearts don't exist
Settin' up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes
You know the streets and it's real as shit, c'mon
Niggas grab your dicks, c'mon
Bitches rub your tits, c'mon

Awww nah, big Snoop Dogg
Slap you with my paw, all across your jaw
Break fool on these bitches while I'm breakin' the law
You come up in my room look bitch you takin' it off
Follow me, I slip em slide em rip em ride em provide em
With that West coast G shit, L.B.C. shit
We dips to this, make chips to this
My, Eastside lifestyle is way foul, move the crowd
Point a pistol at you bitch niggas, BLA-DOW
You got stuck and fucked, Doggystyle
100 spokes Day-tonas, bendin' the corner
All up in Crooklyn, bad bitches are lookin'

So you lovin' us so much this shit is bleedin' through you
If I worked in a restaurant, I'd shit in the food and feed it to you
Most of my niggas cuckoo, easy to gas to shoot you
Even all of them Haitian niggas won't believe this voodoo
Can yo' pussy be chaka, don't let me speak in pat-ois
And kick you in your face like we playin' a game of soc-cer
I love to cock the Glock-a, stack up on loot and vod-ka
And fuck your crew because all of y'all niggas full of ca-ca
The way we doin' damage tell me how the fuck you manage
With my niggas who marinate on foul thoughts and think savage
Them niggas'll throw you in a manhole
And push they hand in yo' ass
And pull yo' head right out yo' asshole!
Parkay nigga we rugged all day nigga
You ready to fuck bitch? Fuck the foreplay nigga
This me for all consumers, my nigga FUCK the rumors
Three in the worst way of pure coke for all you DRUG ABUSERS

Queen Bee, and Notorious B.I.G. nigga
The best that ever lived, the best that ever did it
The best that ever lived it
Cocksuckers, What's his name, huh?
That's how we do it ya'll
To all my niggas in the house
Bad Boy, Who we die for
All day, everyday nigga

For the love of BIG, we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why ya'll niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
Niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
Niggas stay yappin when there's always somethin funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
A yo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel

To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name..

I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for..

Mafia

Representin Bucktown
Mack 11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring

For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name

For BIG I grip the Sig, put six in your wig
Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and thats the way it is for..
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep...
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggas nuthin but squirels, they know we rep...
Niggas tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat and bust for my nigga...

Now when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z
Make you drop to your knees, barely able to breathe
My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn
One for Mafia so take that, Uh, and this one's for...
You know Frank kept me iced out
Mink dragon, seven figures in my bank account
All that material shit, ya'll still tryin to get it
Uh, you fuckin pricks, get off his dick tryin to be like...
All ya'll lame ass niggas keep my man name out your mouth
Or get this shit right, check it, it's the B-I, double G-I, E
Ya'll niggas can't see Poppa, nor the Big Moma
Who you love... for the Y2G, the two ten
We got it sewn, we don't need ya'll help, we hold our own
Cause this goes out to cats not tryin to give it up
BIG lives in us, shout him out...

Akon and B.I.G. yea

Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Cristal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker
Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know I treats my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana drippin'
Big Poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogota
With Colombian niggas named Panama
And Englique and shit
Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped
Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin'
From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
VCR's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sands
Discussing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

Eternal sunshine in this elevated world of mine
Looking for this hour glass of time
Trying to find my purpose on this grand design
Is there anybody out there living?
4-5-6 is on the streets, they shootin
Is there any money out there for me?
You just listen to this husler's story

Picture me, a product of the zone three
Scared lost, don't know what I'm suppose to be
Shit cost, money never came to me
When shit short, I suffered unshamelessly
The lord humble niggas 'specially if they act like
They too big for they draw when they stacks right
Think I'm bullshittin'? A bunch of niggas back like
Right back hungry, stacks gone, they forgot Christ
I know a nigga sold his soul for a nickel rock
I know some hoes for the dro you can hit the cock
I know a nigga workin' 9-5
Been on 15 years, ain't got a car to drive
I know some nigga wanna act hard, flicks pitch
Fake jack boys, can't rob, get killed
Got kin folk backyard big whips
Escart that lift my homeboy this year

Akon

While B.I.G. sittin up with Englique
I'm on the coastline politickin' wit Jose
We got the birds flyin' in the coupe all day
Tryin' to find a new way to smugglin' pure yay'
We bout our business, ain't know small time fees
If you ain't growin the 'caine then we ain't gon' meet
See I'm the one when things get deep
And my Africans will put yo' main man to sleep, now
And Mexico far from the block
Tryin' to figure out how many Glocks to a box, now
Sellin' arms as well as rocks in my socks
If you could show me the money, here's the ki's to the lock, now
Hey, you know the streets is my territory
Ain't scared of nothin, let you fear it for me
Hey, whether win, lose or draw
Believe that death is waitin for all

Niggas is quick to chop rocks and hot hands
So the whole time, I been plottin' on his man
Caught him slippin' and sleepin', I hit his ass wit the can, and
Here's somethin' that you can't understand
I'm on some get back shit, there comes a time
In every man's mind when it's deeper than dollar signs
I been on the grind, got homies doi'n time
Behind niggas actin like bitches and bitches droppin' dimes
I'm duckin' indictments, pussy just wet and wise
Niggas just ain't tellin', no, they know we let it slide
But nah, we gotta ride and him, he gotta die
So if you catch up to his ass before I catch him, give him mine
The rats one thing a real nigga here despise
I'm a five K one killa, I set his ass on fire

Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggas

There's no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell me what's happening to me

The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the 8-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots
Niggas dropped quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain

Is anybody listenin' and tell me can you can see this darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin' hard to breathe
Visions gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried cause it's gettin' hard to see
When your livin' in the house of pain

The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses is to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AKs headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skin headed bitches let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the house of pain

MJB, be worried niggas, yea, Nas

Wendy Williams say I stayed dusted maybe I should
Cuz these rappers'll have your phone tapped like Savion Glover
And on the West, yo, police corrupt, some are bloods
But these Teflons I loaded explodin' some mugs
I'm like Furious in "Boyz n the Hood"
But at the drive through I ain't runnin' I'm dumpin'
Crazy like a Piru and locc'd up, know how Nas do
I'm callin' Henchmen and Conception, to organize a black truce
And we party hard, party wit Nas
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Ya'll yellin' my name but y'all soon dyin'
Tryin' to portray real but they be ly-in
Cuz they want the real niggas to die so they can gain
But never that, this ain't Everlast, this the House of Pain

Uh, it's going out to all the pimps and macs
Y'all know the flavour, Brooklyn style
You know how we do, uh, yeah
All the macs and the dons in the house
Playa playaz, playa, playa - let these hoes know

Is it true, all I wanna do is screw?
Drink brew, with the crew, on the avenue? Ooo!
I flip skins like Mary Lou
I got girls that look like Toni Braxton
And give me the skins without askin'
When I'm relaxin' on my back and you know what time it is, uh
But if it's red man, I'll leave it alone
She can call me on my cellular phone
And I mess around and pick you up
Take you to the crib, stick you up
Put on my Silk CD and lick you up and down
Til you say stop, hit the twat, til your pops call the cops
And when I make bail outta jail, I'mmma wail on that tail
Because the sex never fails

I am, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing - and I been waiting
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons

"What kind a girls do you like?"
Well, that's various
I like long hair or them Halle-Berry-cuts
Real big butts, yeah, thick with lip stick
Cause when it come to girls I'm optimistic
Like the Sounds of Blackness
I don't need practice in the sack it's natural
I break your back in
I pop coochies like my homeboy Luke
Guaranteed to knock your trees off your Timbo boots
You don't get pussy whipped, you whip that pussy
Hit it from the back til it get real cushy, baby
Good sex is what I'm startin'
I get the skin so wet, I make the ass start fartin'
And I pray that dick don't slip
And then I just ride til the sun rise
And when I'm done I whipe the cum on her thighs

This is going out to the pimps and macs
That hit skins 'til their broad catch a asthma attack
But not even Pamatti Miss could resist
The way I jumped up and diss the clitoris
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom in the boom poom
Smoke a little boom, get some head in the bedroom
And then I whisper soft in the ear
You ain't got to home but you got to leave from here
Simple and plain no strings attached
I'm lettin' you know that I'm a certified mac
I hit skins til the leg cramp
So, on the first I can get half the check and half the stash

Something D full effect, baby, baby
Uh, uh yeah, fuck all you bitches

Hey yo, Enuff, man! What you got to drink up in here, man? I'm thirsty

Big slam, quick slam, tin can, whatever
Whether too cold or too hot, you got to keep Pepsi in the freezer
I keep a 3 liter for my crew
My girl like them diet joints too
For when she watch her weight, crack the top I can't wait
Other sodas taste the worst -- I don't even converse
If it can't quench my thirst what you in my fridge for?
What you wanna live for? Life with the dry mouth
Hot like the south, flash out ya 12 ounce and renounce
Nothing can beat the P-e-p-s-i
Yes I drink it constantly; cop it by the case, tastes great, less filling
Non-alcoholic I can feed it to my children
Tell em Biggie said, "Drink it all"; don't test me!
Nothing else beats a Pepsi, if it is, let's see..I'm thirsty

You're now entering the mode of the Notorious Biggie Smalls
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, representing
This one going out to Brooklyn
Ya'll know what time it is
It's going out to all the gangsters
All the pimps, players, hoes and bitches
So this what I want ya'll to do
I want ya'll to grab your Dutch Masters
And ya'll White Owls and ya'll Phillies
Umgh, get you a fat sack, pint of Hennessy and lay back
Gonna do this one for my man Mister Cee, representing all day, every day
And all you other tape niggas and bootleggers, stay in the house
Cause Brooklyn got this shit locked down
So any time you're ready Mister Cee
We gonna get hardcore on these homos

Like I said before, Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, hard-core
Uh, representing, Biggie Smalls in the house, uh, check it, uh
Biggie Smalls is the wickedest
Niggas say I'm pussy, I dare you to stick your dick in this
If I was pussy I'd be filled with syphilis
Herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, getting rid'a ya
Got it locked like the penitentiary
Niggas mention me for MC execution
Who ya choosin, the wack MC
Or the Black Fat MC
Jack Dempsey will start shaking
All it's taking, is some marijuana and I'm making
MCs break fast, like flap-jacks and bacon
Back spins, the windmills, who's still the gin-drinker
Ill-thinker, exploding when the paper hits the ink-ugh
Take the Gangster Chronicles, turn to page 6-6-6
Holocaust, B.I.G. the merciless
Niggas press they luck-and
They get a butt-fuckin
Straight up the ass
Raw dog with the rash
And I don't fuck with the condoms
The condoms is a problem from the AIDS getting sprayed
Diseases, B.I.G. pleases
MCs across the seas is just the way, I crush my prey, hey
I'm crazy and deranged
Blowing niggas out the frame, simple and plain
But getting back, to the black rhinoceros of rap
B.I.G. took a loss, how preposterous is that, nigga

Recognize
Notorious Biggie Smalls, '94 Ready To Die

Uhh.. UHH
Yeah..
Uh! Yeah.. yeah..
Uhh..
I'm on..
Fuck em.. yeah, uhh..
With my hands gripped.. praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Our father.. uh-huh..

What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake

Our father.. if I should die before I wake

Fluck that
Snap a nigga shit, smash him with the fifth, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the Glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher; mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
Recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin my niggas thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, hop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga.. whoah..

Yo when you fuckin wit Mac, you fuckin wit the best
Still going to war with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggas get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin -- from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggas start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
Or I sick two pits to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbin my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggas takin some shit
Picture niggas takin my shit

Niggas never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
In the year 2000, all drunk and pissy
Off whiskey, you can miss me, actin gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A
Doin it the O.G. way; it's sorta like
The Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
The Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and seperate yo' head from yo' spine
So, "Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop" and
Fuck you niggas that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy, of this nation, for assassination
Of the young black male in this black hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
That you and 2Pac got yo' shit together
California Love

R.I.P. Big
We some niggas that's gonna make you proud of this game
Smell me? Jones, Capo
Cash Money, Santana
Dipset, Lil Weezy
Let's ride, Let's ride
Cause real Gs know the feeling
It's hard body, no remorse for the killing

Mad trees and bitches in dungarees
The city under seas, kitchen hundred degrees
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it 'til it freeze
I'm from another breed, them s-s-southern Gs
I sip promethazine, I lean, I stand tall
I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball
Steee-rike, yup, so get it right
Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
And a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat pork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'mma shoot it out if I'm facing the L
Yeah, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby, nigga, nine to five, ten to six

All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, it'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn

It's showdown time, throwdown time
Safety off, four pound time
Clack clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine
Check it man, I'm with whatever
Goodness gracious, the paper
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred
Keep it coming 'til I'm full on my stomach
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my haze
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga
Trying to get rid of the life, alright?

As I grab the Glock, put it to your head piece
One in the chamber, the safety is off, released
Biggie Smalls the savage
Doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material, for the imperial
Mic gripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drop with you
.45 Glocks and Tecs are expected when I wreck shit
I got techniques dripping out my butt cheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets
I'm ready to die, and nobody can save me
My life is played out like a Jheri curl
I'm ready to die

A whole lotta niggas want Big to make a demo tape
'Specially that, BUM-ASS NIGGA uhh
This goin out to you nigga recognize
Yo 50, what's this?

Microphone murderer, mass mayhem maker
B.I.G.'s on the mic, call the undertaker
Make an appointment, schedule a interview
Because you know what Big Man's about to do
50 Gran' on the Technic at the right peak
Brothers wanna hear the words Big Man speak
The microphone I rip it, the burner got the clip in
Slammin MC's like Scottie Pippen
Flippin on Old Gold, cold as the rhymes you stole
Puffin on dime bags and I been told
My words are harder than a brick, Chinese arithmetic
A thick stick and my dick
Makes me sick when you pick the whick-whack rhyme G
You get what you pumpin is Tic-Tac time Z
B.I.G. moves swifter than a ninja
Even on stickups I'm the masked avenger
Keep my eyes open and the case closed
No eyewitnesses, no names are exposed
Just the heavyset one with the big gun
And a sweet tongue shakin down everyone
Loot like Michael Jackson kicks like Bo Jackson
Benz like Freddie Jackson, no need to ask in the crew
Oooh! No frontin, no fakin moves
Fightin or fuckin, resort to the stick and move
Smack the fool that disagree, recognize the pedigree
Rhyme is mine cause I said it's me
Step to a Big Man grippin the mic stand
Keep a bankroll and so do 50 Gran'
And, I give you my hand cause you deserve a pound
Tryin to blow up the spot, in my part of town
Braves, because you get no praise
I treat you like a derelict with AIDS
Recognize, I don't fuck with the St. Ides
B.I.G. down with O.G.B
Old Gold Brothers for the others that missed me
The crew stay deep on Bedford and Quincy
Rhymes in the pocket for a quick hand to hand
You want it to be on, there's a Tec in the garbage can
I pull bitches like Kim Fields, Brooke Shields
Shelley Long, Connie Chung, I can go on and on
Word is bond I'm a don~!
I split 'em and run up in 'em I fuck 'em and then I duck 'em
I hit 'em in the shitter and forget her, and it gets better
B.I.G. are the letters
Niggas know the pedi'...

That's the end!! What you want me to do? DAMN~!

C-Gutta, where you at?
D Rockafella
Caesar Leo Degenero
Blake C
Money SL

B.I.G. is making this cream
Bitches always say what the hell does that mean?
B is for the bitches, who can't understand
How one fly nigga became a man
I is for the way it goes in and out
One by one I knocks 'em out
G is for the way the game goes in the gutter
Other MC's man they ain't sayin' nuthin'
Rockin' on, to the break of dawn
Meet the bitch, get the pussy, get the math, I'm gone

It ain't no more to it

Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah, ya'll, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop
What you think, I'm stupid?
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep

I throw a bomb through your window
Burn you up and your ho
I catch your mama going to therapy and cut her throat
Your little sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit your park close up with the Louisville Slugger
B.G.-zy is the hustler, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head-busters
Cluckers, you know I got 'em, two for one, my nigga
I'm on V.L. if you want me, get some my nigga, come on

Thugging is my thing; if I'm beefing, I'm banging
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like 'em; bitches, I don't trust 'em
Niggas, I can't stand 'em, I creep down and pluck 'em
Strap stay in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, "pop," goes the nine
That's how it got to be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play the game for keeps

I remember when niggas slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room, bitch
Want some old nigga? Fuck with me, I'mma do 'em, shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in their rectum right after I dome checked 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gonna mention me
I been out doing it for years--since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consists of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, cause that's what I love

I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Dont have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fucking with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
And trust that, ain't bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with a .223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move cause somebody fixing to get split

Na, Na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip'em and reverse'em
I'm coming so alert them
You haven't seen the worst and
I'm right near you and my gun blast quick, dog
Could kill you so run, dash, get gone
Wodies movin slow around this time they got bricks dog
I ain't got bricks dog, nigga break it off, what

Un huh, B.I.G. with the Cash Money Millionaires, forever
Juvenile, Lil' Wayne, Baby, Turk, B.G., Manny Fresh
Slim, CEO, and me P. Diddy, B.I.G, Born Again
And we won't stop, get money niggas

B.I.G. 2000
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again
Come on

The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?

While I take tokes of the marijuana
Smoke
Throw you in a choke
Gun smoke, gun smoke
The rap slayer
The hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers
Hail Mary, full of grace
Smack the bitch
In the face
Take her Gucci bag
And her North Face off her back
Jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh, you got him mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya
I just want the paper
The Visa
Kapeesha?
I'm out like
"The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho
Swift fist like
Cumacho
I got so
Much style, I should be down with The Stylistics
Make up to break up
Niggas need to wake up
Smell the indonesia
Beat you to a seizure
She don't remember shit
Just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor
And me hittin' the clits
Suckin' on the tits
Had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't, ugly, love
My dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House Of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jump-in Around
She said, "B.I.G."

Human sacrifices, canibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit, I just
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pocket, and baby I'm just
Dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war
I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz is as
Heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread
Red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wet on the third, then she's dead on the fourth
I'm dead wrong

How many nuts to the center of your booty hole?
Hold on, shorty, cause I'm about to slap this groupie nigga
Jab this fluesy nigga, watch 'em bleed, then shit dookie, nigga
Spooky nigga, you gettin' skinny like you Pookie, nigga
Blood spill got you laggin' out like that soupie nigga
Smoke this Lucy nigga, time passin' on the frank mic
Watch 'em dyin' slow, then see ya skin, you start to change color
My goons lay the flood, leave you layin', drippin' blood
Then ended up fingerfuckin' your mother at a strip club
We dead wrong for how we gutter like how in the sudden
Fascinated how all of this street shit, we straight mother
Fuck it
We thug rugged to the tenth power
Like B.I.G. was listenin'
So Gimme The Loot for the past ten hours
Another dick
Hear the click of my gun cock
Same mentality when I was scheeming on a lunch box
Gimme that!
Twenty-focused and I'm sorry Campbell

It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many piggybacked off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lives
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling "God bless"
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'mma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest

Throw your hands in the sky, nigga...

I'm stickin' ice picks on the tip of ya dick
Give your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?
Am I hard hard core? Harder than the Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with a spliff
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized cause I love to see niggas die
Brains all leakin' out on the street
And the pastor preachin' "He was a good man."
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singin' sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, bout six cross the pelvis
You fuck with the high guy, ya die
Yeah the same motherfucker yellin' "Look up in the sky!"
I'm on some old neck shit, Suplex shit, hardcore sex shit, and Tec shit

What you want, nigga?
What you want, nigga? What you, what you want nigga?)

A repetitive loop
All I need to destroy a soloist or group
Huh, I put it to ya boy
Hope you got the scoop
Biggie Smalls, the rap genius
I keep the Glock by the penis, the cleanest cut
Fuck the sluts with the big humongous butts
Huh, I use a rubber, but
My style is gushy like the hooker's pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk to push me
Into flamin' 'em like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium
Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggas in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggas don't want the friction
Told you before how I bring the dra-ma
Slam Larry Johnson and his Grandma-ma

Aye yo
Time to reunite 'em

It's the Commission, niggas
B-I-G lives on
No more music, Brooklyn
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Let's go!
It's fuckin' deadly

Lucky Lefty of the Commission, bow down
By now you fuckers know this is our crown
Bucktown bullies, Brooklyn Biggie
Bedstuy Hov like Bedstuy Gold
Bentley drivers, Louis Vuitton buyers
Jet fuel abusers, sippin' Petrus
Once Upon A Time In America's muse
You based on us, you fiction
Ya eight's don't bust, you a constant contradiction
Ladies please use contraception
Conception's at a all time high with sexin'
Use protection
You fuckers shoulda never been born, shoulda never got signed
How the fuck you got on?
How the fuck you got Shawn?
I'm too advanced, the Lance Armstrong of the dance
Rubberband man before T.I. was
King of New York like B.I. was
B.K. all day, it's in my blood
You wanna see my mask and gloves?
What the fuck you want?

Two of the world's greatest
Brooklyn's Finest
The Commission lives on
BIG Forever
The Biggie Duets
Let's go

Venue after venue, I've been through
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired
I'm a roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left
Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu
Beautiful, that's how the night goes
Get out them tight clothes
Get in some night clothes
I invite those girls that smoke lye
Keep it real with you
You keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screaming "Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance"

These hoes don't treat you like I treat you
Like my contacts, I can see right through
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?
Queen Bitch means number one and two
Wifey, ya'll ain't got to like me
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one
Y'all know where I'm from
Bucktown, lay your ass down
Probably just mad because Frank chose me
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie
Girls call my telephone just to hang up
While me and you is in the crib, laying up
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together
And that we gonna have a kid together
Whatever, me intimidated, never
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim
Anyway, I fuck better than you
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?
B.I.G. kept it real with me, and that's that

Allow me to lace these lyrical dooches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' Moet is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin, music blastin'
But I just can't quit
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benz's
C-Notes by the layers, true fuckin players

Throw your hands in the air, if youse a tru playa
To the honies gettin money playin niggas like dummies
If you gun up in your waist, don't shoot up the place
Cause I see some ladies tonite that should be havin my ba-by
Baybee, uh

Straight up honey really I'm asking
Most of these niggas think they me mackin', but they be acting
"What's your name, what's your sign?"
Ask you what your interest are, who you be wit?
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Or three o' clock, Lil Ceas pull the truck up out the parking lot
Roll a blunt cause he like to spark a lot
Steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs, and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do
And watch a movay, in the jaccuzay, bay-bay

Nigga, Versace down
Donna Karan, Diamonds glarin', Niggas starin'
Now I got my pants draggin in the Benz wagon

Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep

Been caused the death of them
These dudes don't want no more, shit is affecting them
Tops popped off, them niggas from the bridge

Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow they shot 'em in their cars

And the niggas that took the hits on my niggas you been warned
P's not the one, Hav not the one
You try to run up on us, we already busting the guns

Tie you up, cut your balls off just for you

Attention MCs........Attention MCs
Beef doesn't happen on records
Beef does not happen on records
You don't want no beef you fucking fake studio ass gangsta
Beef is every so-called ghetto superstar that rose
On some bullshit
What's beef 2006?
Bad Boy Bitch we still here

Yes it's me, the B.I.G
Competition ripper ever since 13
Used to steal clothes was considered a thief
Until I started hustlin' on Fulton Street
Makin' loot, knockin' boots on the regular
Pass the microphone I'm the perfect competitor
Jewels and all that, my clothes is all that
Chumps steppin' to me, that's where they took a FALL at!
B.I.G. without burner, that's unheard of
I stay close to mine like Tina on Turner
Quick to smother, a punk motherfucker
Undercover, word to mother, I'm above ya
And I love ya, cause you're a sweet bitch
A crazy crab, the type to make my dick itch
I flow looser than Luther, words ya get used ta
B.I.G. is a born trooper
Like ice cream I scoop ya, my music you wanna get loose ta
Stay pimp, and I'm not a booster
So what'cha got to say? This mackin' word is bond
There's no other assumption, I got it going on
I'm not conceited, my friends tell me this
Even my mother, be noddin' her head to this
Makes her proud to see her one son get loud
Flip on a sucker, and bow to the crowd
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4

Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?

1, 2, 3, and...

Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, Henny gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coup's up take the new Lame for a sec
12" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer in a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzzi

They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it cause she running her mouth

She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Next who wanna move is getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I +Marked For Death+, +Hard to Kill+ like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

Ah, Yo
Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crack music and the kings of the clubs
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dieing
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach
Snoop, Fab, Big and Bust of the stand if you can't reach

Uhhh, uhhh
Fox then B.I.G
Who fucking with Fox, who want it with I
Bust a shot for me and Big from the villfredo sky
Got my joan fross shit on, hop off my dick
Canary bangle-round I ain't gon' 20 carrots on this bitch
Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch
From the Bentley blinds spur kill 'em with the six
Bedstuy what up y'all, what up with your girl
How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
On Nastrand Ave, ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled
Ill Na Na - squeezing the lhama
Bog roll dutty, Foxy and Poppa

Run for your gun you suckers
B.I.G. I'm a get them motherfuckers
Don't you worry about a thing, bang-bang-boogie
I got a few chickens that's gon' work that noogie

Gun in your mouth, motherfucker quit running your mouth

What you really want from a nigga?...

Chill Twan, damn man!
That nigga Big got somethin to say?
Yo Big, what'chu got to say Big?

Special shoutout to my man
MC Homicide and DJ Fatal
Twin one and two my man Milk
My man Fred Dawg, the O.G.B. crew
Y'all know how we flow
And I'mma drop it like this y'all

Oh what a feeling! Drivin' in my four by four
Girlies galore, B.I.G. on the door
Chrome trimming, with the smoke tint
Givin' chumps a hint, as I count my mint
Stacks of doves, half my man's is C-note
All from sayin' rhymes that B.I.G. wrote
Blunt, I take a toke, but only if it's weed
Skunk with no seeds, a sip of Hennessy
Pass to D, or maybe movin' solo
Never with a skeezer by my side, that's a no-no
Tell me I ain't the flyest nigga that you ever saw
Live in action, guaranteed raw!

Bed-Stuy Brooklyn where this rapper was originated
Your rhymes ain't shit; they must be constipated
Many awaited, the heavyset brother from Fulton Street
To drop a rhyme to a funky beat
Expellin MC's as if I was at Sarah J
Or boys and girls at any school around the way
Opponents, pupils, but I'm the principal
Hard to beat, damn near invisible
Niggas wanna know, how I live the mack life
Makin money smokin mics like crack pipes
Flippin' bombs, stayin' calm, givin' my people my palm
And sayin' rhymes to set off the alarm!
Used to steal clothes, was considered a thief
Chumps steppin' to me, that's where they took a fall at!
A crazy crab, ya might make my dick itch
B.I.G. is a born, trooper
Stay dipped, and I'm not a booster
There's no other assumption, I got it goin' on
Live in action, guaranteed RAW
Round two the rhyme regulator here to roast ya
As ya follow this yeah, I gave a toast to ya crew
See, they popped on ya like a kernel
They didn't realize that the beef was eternal
Internal injury that's what you're soon to see
B.I.G. keeps company
Sometimes in my waist, if they come opponent
Run upstairs, change my skimmer and my coat and
I'll be floatin', to your punk part of town
Anybody fronting, they better duck down
Don't get mad cause I grazed ya
You jumped in that 4-door Blazer, quick I couldn't get a good hit
Shit, I was aimin' for the melon
But the kick of my three-pound auto there's no tellin'

And you don't stop, and you don't stop
You keep on
To my man Milk, and Thai
Like I said before the whole O.G.B. is in full effect
Most definitely
Sent a shout on

Hey what it is pimpin
P.S.C. pimpin!
Y'all already know what it is man, its a bad boy thing man
Grand hustle collaboration, Y'all already know man
A-Town pimpin!

Slim Thugga!
I roll strapped Glock 40 in my lap
I rap but still think like I'm grinding in the trap
Trying to adapt to the change from the streets to the game
Can't be selling CD's and still selling dem thangs
Cause snitches drop names and bring alot of problems
And putting somthing in they head the only way you gonna solve em'
Jackas stay plotting watching your every move
And the minute you snooze will be the minute you lose, dude
Thats the rules so I cruise with the tools
To fix the damn fools that think I'm slipping with my jewels
Breakin old habits so hard to do
Thats why you see me on the same block with the same crew
And everybody sitting fat living good
And I'm the only nigga that be rapping in my hood
I was raised by the hustlas, and ganged by the G's
And taught by the bosses how to stack that cheese

You got rich and G shit is still a part of you
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
You still watch for the haters and the robbing crew
When on shot that nigga like I started to
Fresh out the dealership crackin open cigars in the coupe
Man cause breakin old habits so hard to do

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
Than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggas with punany, like Connie
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flying in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rentals

I used to drive a Chevy Monte Carlo, bricks of blow all in it
I was taught to sell the shit, you put your nose all in it
Let my bitch drive the Benz but the Rolls off limits
How you call yourself pimpin, with hoes all in your buisness
What it is, the music business or the streets make a decision
I do this in my sleep, and you way out your division pimp
This game we play for keeps, and the rules remain hidden
This ain't a place for lames and that snitching shit is forbidden
After sitting in the kitchen and whipping with hopes of getting back
All that off a brick to go blow it, so it even 50 stacks
And now I'm sitting back, thinking about a time
When a nigga get a 100 g's, think he went down
But now look for loyalty in the game, it ain't there
And things ain't the same they changed it ain't fair
Real niggas dead, doing their time and ain't here
You commit the same crime and come home the same year

Wooo! There's gonna be a lot of punchin' in this motherfucker!
Y'all better be swift with that punch button, Jack!
Biggie! - Biggie!

People look at you like youse the user
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D that's why my mom's hate me
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
You better have your gat in hand cause man

Come and run with me - I really wanna show you
How I run the streets - I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's - I really wanna show you

I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I told her she could be Lieutenant
Bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin' black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
We got infiltrated like Nino at the Carter
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
Conspiracy - She'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me! Blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black
Man turn to John Gotti

Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin'
Take ki's til' they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his crib raided, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam; moms sister his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin up coke a fiend holds it in a seperate car
Cooks it up til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggas die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin my weight in they titties and drawers
My bitches out of state get bust while they pushin my cars
Callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' stay nasty, push the dash
For the stash box is where the cash be; watchin for task force
Cause I know they comin but I'm reachin my goal
Fuck bummin, I'm makin sure I leave this whole game wit somethin
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby

To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcholic man
Inject a tall can to his blood stream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I better fuck it up
Ask the hooker, If I didn't jug her
She try to front, then I put the Chucky Booker on her
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggas on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree, you better be
Filled with energy, niggas never gettin' me

Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life

It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man, I done learned from the
Best of em; Took the first slot, niggas still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stresin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em , outflowed the rest of em'
Cuz everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bullshit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Oprah
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggas that don't know no better
King like Coretta, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times

To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!

To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker HEAR??
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin HER
The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
"Why you wanna...play your games on me"
Bitch, you crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real bloodspill shit
My rap-pin tac-tics are drastic
Stretchin motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigreeeee

So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Hahhhh, AHHHHHHHH HAH
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Yeah, yo
Asked me the reason, and I said loot
Man that's all I'm here for, therefore
When death declares war, you know what to prepare for
Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggas shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha ho I might slide
Runnin' wit' this big guy, y'all niggas is pint-size
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound
And show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground
Just let me get down

I be like WHAAAAT? Let me clear my throat
Break the smoke, Missy gotta hit some high notes
HEYYYYYY! Yo, from coast to coast I burn like toast
So dope that I floats through snow, nig-guh
Oh, you don't wanna battle me
The agony be like, "Somebody help me please!"
Feel my pressure, never could a bitch flow better
In any weather, I biddy-bang-bang in ya, nigga
Ah-huh, I used to be the chick to lick the lollipop
Now I pop through your body parts
BLAOW, BLAOW, you like the way I interact
Proceed to smack, any MC that's wack

Give it to me, OHHHH, send it to me, OHHHH
But before I get down, where's my money?
Let me get down

Mack, feelin the funk)

Bringin it live to you bitch ass niggas

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
Nigga please, blood floods your Dungarees
Laugh now, cry later; I rhyme greater
Than the average player hater, and spectators
Short-change niggas, snort-'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range, nigga
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Move from BK to New Jeruz; thinking 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
I want my spot back--take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Slugs missed ya; I ain't mad at 'cha
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smoking something
I laced it with the basic, six TV's a system
Knocking Mase shit; face it, we hard to hit
Guard your shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss

Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right

Niggas playing they hands wrong
That's why they won't last long
Finessed what I was dealt with from the day I was born
While you bent up on that corner, niggas plotting and scheming
Up in them little holes, be creeping with Mac demons
Niggas know not to fuck with my dough
Niggas know not to fuck with this little bro, I'm ten seconds hit'n'go
Black mask, black truck, chrome rims, Chuk' Timbs
Enough to confuse any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel with
You gotta get hit, your man dead, so you got a hand in it
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggas with the biggest balls set the new laws
And flip fours, have 'em washing drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearing niggas situations, singing like Lou Rawls
Sitting on the stand with no remorse

Yo, yo, how we do niggas, I don't beef, I shoot niggas
If I can't get the main character, a few niggas then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carhartts, it ain't hard to get em
Like blaow when I hit em, the nigga shit his drawers
When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggas thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin' put holes through your Range Rove'
Cocksucker, beat it, while you bleedin' on the dashboard
Niggas get, what they hand call for, I'm gettin' rich
You get deaded, I get erections over revenge, kid
You get a quiet spot in the shade, for a grave
I'll lay a nigga down and steam roll away...

But I would've loved to hear
A Big Pun and B.I.G. collabo
That shit would've been incredible

Aye you know what I'm sayin, it was just happen
We have our day, you know?
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?
We keep it, keep it, keep it going from there

Uhh, I drink filthy
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD
Cryin, know my friends is lyin
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Apoligies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest

Nigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap
You keep your chrome cause the streets is chilly
Now get your grind on
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin mo' stressed
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor
Cause the streets are killin

Yo, yo
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggas talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin nuttin
If ain't blazin somethin with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills
We blessed with the will to never surrender
Cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja
It's my world

I got that new F-N, call it that faggot nigga gun
Couple of hollow tips make you faggot niggas run
Crack pull up, everybody clear out
Anybody pumpin that rock is gettin aired out
I'm in that caddy with my bitch in the pack
Your mommy got a body but she itchin to clap
And I know you pitchin purple but we switchin the packs
Listen, don't make me hurt you I'm just givin the facts
On that I 9-5 swirvin to a town near you
My niggas watch out for that Black Surburbans
And no it's not the Feds, man papi's home
And papi got it good, he could put you on
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops
Just to see my niggas eat and shit and huggin the blocks
Crack a chestize 'em, right besides 'em
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up
And niggas get shot in broad day cause we don't give a...
Fuck little niggas on bike and just shoot you
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shits brutal
I done seen fiends O.D., shot the wrong pack
Then they call the shit the bomb smack
Word to Crack, the god body, the hard body, the realest ever
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? Never

Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
Be Mor-gan than Freeman
To old school cats that call gats toolies
In killin wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin, shit
When Frank start bustin, Frank start somethin
Killin ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks

All it's takin'
Is some marijuana and I'm makin'
MC's break fast like flapjacks and bacon
Back spins to windmills. Who's still the gin drinker?
Ill thinker explodin' when the paper hits the ink
Grab your gangster chronicles and turn to page 6-6-6-
The holocaust, BIG the merciless
Hurry up and close the gate when my freestyle escapes
I'm giving young minds statutory rape
Mothafuckers thought I slip bust my lip, right?
You didn't know the extra clip's on my hip
Don't tempt me, you don't wanna fuck with M-E

Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin' where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitchin', button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin' is a can of ass-whippin'
Hey, I'll be kickin', you son, you doin' all the yappin'
Actin as if it can't happen
You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin'
Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin'
So what cha' want nigga, ya won't nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw

And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Meth-tical, puttin' niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted true, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin' down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin' carpet get
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!
Baby accept it, utmost respect it and

Welcome to my center
Honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Ricochet off the vertebrae then splat where your heart be at
Now starts the cardiac arrest Where's your vest?
You forgot now you slowly drop cuz your heart stopped
Beaten, your bitch-ass crew is retreatin
Niggas left you, fucked up passed out with your ass out
Pockets ran through stripped with your brains bashed out
Niggas wanna do me slugs just run through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin' rap phenomenon, plus
Nigga touch me you better bust me
Tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so

Motherfucker uh

New York to Chi
Perfect combination
Kells, Biggie

I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-Tang
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete
Don't sleep! Banged the skins in a week
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee
Now she fuckin him and fuckin me, see

I ain't lookin for no wife
Hit the club, drink, dance all night wit cha
Do the pussy good, I might do anything for ya

Now I play her far like a moon play a star
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her
Pimpin hard with the female passenger
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
She's sayin I dissed her cause I'm fuckin her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me?
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit yo' nasty ass

Red bows, stilettos do please
Hit fellas to show off yo' booty
I'm hangin wit the best of them, sweet
If you wanna, I'm a veteran
Just someone to make a friend of mine

I roll up, the black Impala
I'm so high when I walk in the club
I see this chick that used to get the dick
Now she freakin on the floor, make a nigga reminisce
Ah, wanna back in my ride again
But I don't want no girlfriend
See I just wanna hit it and we can be cool
We can do this if you feelin the same way too
Come on girl, lets go to my hotel
After party all night in my hotel
Pop mo', smoke 'dro in my hotel
In twenty minutes, girl hit me on my cell

And ya don't stop
Hit it
Mumblin and whisperin is what I hear
When b.i.g. appear on the scene niggas get scared
Why? I'm not the stick-up man
I don't want the rings on your hand I don't understand
When I come thru the avenue I must know voodoo
Cause all eyes are on you know who-- huh!
And my so-called friends beg for ends for me to lend
But this bankrolls they won't spend
I don't need em let the welfare feed em
When it come to wassup the peace sign is how I greet em - uh
Sometimes they won't get that, sweatin me for some chit-chat
Bite my lyrics like kit-kats
Open your eyes, realize ain't no sugar in my tank
Out of all my friends, there's just one I want to thank
My man Big D taught me a lesson that was great
That good things come to those who wait
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dip, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rapping is my speciality
And the best is me, so the rest will see
BIG don't need to practice
I'm like a sharpshooter shoot the needle off a cactus
Only thing I lack is stage fright
And conceit? I completely defeat the weak -uh
Even the strong don't last long
Cause I'm Brooklyn born, bay-bro
I'm not a paper gangster of no sort don't smoke newports
When I get stressed I grab my vest
Put a MC to the test quick specially if he talk slick about who we flipped then whipped
I tripped the competition, stepped across the step to the big boss
You know, of course, they took a loss
Steppin to big and a hitman 50 grand
Like sinkin' in quicksand, ya need a hand my man
Damn, tried to give you the warning sign
When I said chill, I wasn't sayin' LL rhyme
I was telling ya not to flare up
He's about to tear up, I'm telling you not to erupt
Cause he just as corrupt as a DJ should be - huh
50 Grand, and I'm the BIG
Mister Cee..

Yo, here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go motherfucker here we go
Can ya withstand this kind of a man
Gettin in your ass like sand
But this ain't a date at the beach lil each
And every mc in the place check the speech
And i'll bet the dough from my show they can't get wit
Mister Cee on the flow till I get bit

Try to get props on the brother, that pops the most
And clocks the most, drops the most shit like a pigeon
Listen, to the words I'm slippin' through saliva
Ain't a MC liver, I'm the rap MacGyver
Doin' tricks with my lips so quick
If you blink you would miss the great style of Chris
Don't try to diss, cause I dismiss, dissaprove, dissapoint
Rappers that think they the joint
Huh, they'll get the point quicker
Faster even, MC's I'm leavin' until you can't breathin
You call it a homicide, I call it a suicide
Try to battle me boy ya deserve to die
Punch ya in your eye, before I blade ya
To let ya know that I can fight before I slayed ya
Call me Chris, this I insist
Anything different will lead to closed fist
A wrap up. you don't wanna get tapped up

Instantly we blaze trees, before these hoes swing low on Lil' Cease
The friskiest mc quick the mix D.C. and Pepsi
Have you broad trippin in my Ford Expedition listen
Diamonds and rhyming put me back on top
I pop wine with lime ins and the platinum drop
For players at them drop ya was like looking shorty chocolate roch
I suggest you jump out them clothes too
We can go on and on like Erykah Badu
Or we can get freaky in the Lex 450 while you lick me
I'm doing sixty quickly, females and black tails down they hustle up
Wanna cuddle up, you shy I'm your comforter, I know you love it huh
I make you feel right if it's real tight young ho' aight?

When I release you lose teeth like Little Cease
Player please blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half for my warpath
Laugh now, cry later, I rhyme greater
Then the average player hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice they see me in the streets they be like ''yo he nice''
But that's on a low doe be the cats with no dough try to play me at my show
I pull out four fo's and go up in there clothes
Short change, slut came, abortion came quicker
Bought the range nigga. They still tickle me
I used to be as strong as ripple be, till Little Cease crippled me
Now I play hard like my girls nipples be
The game's sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Moved from B.K. to New Jeruz
Thinking about all the plains we flew, females we ran through
Now the year's new I lay my game flat I want my spot back take two
Mad because I blew players envious to many players on my...
Shit strenuous when my men bust you just move with such stamina
Catch cases come out frontin, smoking something
Sippin white Russians bitch in the Benz bumpin
Laced it with the basic six TV's a system knocking mase
Face it, we hard to hit, guard your shit, before I hit you
With your re-up light the P up, licked shots, woke your seed up
Went in the ashtray sparked the weed up, long-kiss

I'm flaming gats, aiming at, these...
Maniacs put my name in rap
So part the game is that like it hustle backwards
I smoke blackwoods and dutchies you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go touchy touchy
You bleeding lovely with your spirit above me
Or beneath me your whole life you live sleepy
Now you rest internally sleepy, you burn when you creep me
My nine flies baptize rap guys
With the holy ghost I put holes in most you hold your toast shaky
Flip and try to break me, look what you made me do
Brains blew my team in the marine-blue, six coupe
Skied it out weed it out...
*Laughing *

Yo man I can rhyme all night man
Ay ay do your thing!
I wanna curse man!
Ay do your thing man!
It's late man
Go ahead man
Ay just do your thing man, do your thing man

Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Hitting fannies, spending chips at Mannies
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Mwa, may you rest in peace
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
There's my pilot, steers my leer, yes my dear
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear
The kids the dog, everybody dying -- no lying
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a little to Vicious
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

Its Bad Boy bitch
Scram Jones... the Clipse... B.I.G

Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Muah!, may you rest in peace
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all

Do you know where you're going to
Just a memory...everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills you

Do you know where you're goin to
Just a memory...so you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
You're nobody till somebody kills you

Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if it's on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, you're nothing

Ha ha ha ha ha check out the facade
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was loitering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh

Biggie Duets...
Born Again...
Life After Death...
Legacy lives on..and on, and on
These motherfuckers still can't see you BIG
Shit you ain't even here..
Motherfuckers better step their game up..
Greatest of all time, Greatest of all time!
Motherfuckers...

Ummm, one of the most talked about parts of your life, your relationship with faith. How are things?
I mean, We ain't together no more, she just had a baby from me, we cool though, we tight

It's that Faith Evans right here
Biggie Smalls, hey Faith you ready? You ready?

Venue after venue, I been through
Come up to the telly so i could bend you
Jealous females call you sluts and whores

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the beat, you locked the flow

You twist up while I whip the bourbon
You teach me while I'm steady learning like

And I knew..
I knew from the very first moment
That you were a king fit just for a queen
And I can tell from day one you were for me
Who know that this love be the legacy

And I'm so happy to say that I know you
My whole life was changed instantly
And I was willing to play my position, yeah
When you made my wife to be
You are here by my side
Through all the changes
We've been through everything
So far from strangers
You more like my best friend
My perfect angel
I rock you till the end
I love you till the end

Sometimes I get caught up imagining
The way things could’ve been
And there’s no way that we can press rewind
We can’t go back we can’t turn back the time
No, no oh we can’t turn it
We can’t turn back the time

You know, we gunna always be together ‘cause you know, we got a little story together

It goes B to the I to the G so proper
Call us chief knockers

Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby

Don't you know I'm the ultimate? To get this nookie, be fortunate
Just like tastin pussy with pork in it
People stop when I'm walkin in, I'm twist-in twistin 'em
Back on ten, I'm talkin 'bout like when Mase come back again
My ski's is immaculate, my paper stackin keep trackin
I'm mackin yo slackin, reaction makes ya'll dicks grin
I'm mo' better than gold diggers with figures
Mo' bigger than Jigga's and even Paris Hilton's
Damn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines
Me won't give you none
Sent amilia, all you wanna do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, get high baby
The ultimate rush, the drugs baby

Now Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love with 'em
Hit 'em and forget 'em and go handle my business
I like the kind of whine and dine, who grindin' all the time
Yo ex girl was a fly, but now lucked up on a dime, nigga
What is it with you, all you wanna do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play around
I like to lay never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I go search matchin' shoes for my skirt
Tuesday I saw you on the zee, but you still wanna get wit me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
Me and my friends got your Benz, attractin' mens
And spendin' dividends, blowin' like the wind

So I guess you think I'm slippin' cause I ain't flippin'
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be trippin'
I ain't trippin' nor flippin', I'm just liquor sippin'
At the bar, tippin' wit your money, can you pay the difference?
It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jump in every car, except for mines
Nigga, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way to flaw, you should hang me on your wall
All I do all day is drink Tanqueray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, me look cute down to them features
My waste, my physique, me don't want freak-a-leek
Should I wine and dine? You put ring on your fingers
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers
Sex will never linger, hold up, put up the blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give yo ass the middle finger
You better slow your roll baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pin number, just page me when you will baby

The lesson from the Smith and Wesson is depressin

My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!!

On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die
If he start to cry, ask why?
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
You herbs get, stomped quickly for raw T's and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them
I think they got cumin, cause they nothin but bitch
Tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke, but yo I rock diamonds that's sick
Got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
I know you playin you was rich
Fuck you prick, when I see you I'ma..

When I see you I'ma.. when I see you I'ma..

Brooklyn X4
Bronx X4
Queens Bridge X4
Uptown X4

YEAH
Where Brooklyn at x6
Lean back lean back

Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezin asses
Smokin blunts was a daily routine since 13
A chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey deuce and a deuce deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the mac in my knapsack Loungin black
Smokin sacks up in ac's and sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys wanna chat but all we wanna know is where the party at
And I can bring ma GAT, if not I hope I dont get shot
Better throw my vest on ma chest cause niggas is a mess
It dont take nothin but frontin for me to start something
Buggin and buckin at niggas like I was duck huntin
Dumbin out just me and my crew

Ma niggas dont dance they just pull their pants and do the rockaway
Say Ma niggas dont dance they just pull up their pants and do the rockaway
Lean Back, Lean Back, Lean Back

Hugs from the honeys, pound from the roughnecks, seen my men sayd that I knew from the
Projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had ma piece
Sure do two 22s in ma shoes
Holla if u need me luv, I'm in the house
Roam and stroam, see what the honeys is about
Moet poppin ho hoppin ain't no stoppin big papa Im a bad boy
Niggas wanna front who got ur back? Biggie
Niggas wanna flex who got the GAT ? Biggie
It ain't hard to tell Im an eastcoast overdoser
Nigga u scared ur supposed to
Nigga I toast ya put fear in ur heart
F**k up the party before it even start
Is he drunk over henny and skunk
Or some brand newbian shit beating down punks

In a tight dress I think I might just
Hit her wit a little Biggie one-on-one
How to tote a GUN and have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation, ma men big Jock got the GLOCK in his waist and was smokin
If money smell bad then this ni**a biggie's stinkin
She grabbed ma arm and said let's leave calm
Im hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a heineken
Ni**as start to Loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a F**KING fight broke out
So I can put hickeys on ya chest like lil' Shawn

Grab the 9,2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets,a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run,so I grab my gun!

I'm sticking ice picks on the tip of your dick
Give your testicles a swift kick ain't that some shit
Am I hard-hardcore harder than the Plymouth
It ain't no myth. It's a nigga with a spliff
And a chrome four-fifth pressed on yo back
So what you want nigga?
How you wanna act?
I'm uncivilized cause I love to see niggas die
Brains all leaking out on the street
Now he's singing sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, 'bout six cross the pelvis
You fuck with the high die you die
You're the same motherfucker
If you look up in the sky
I want some old nex shit
Suplex shit
Hardcore sex shit

Grab the 9, 2 clips and run a muck!

A repetitive loop all I need to display
Solo is the proof I put it to you boy
Biggie Smalls the rap genius
I keep the Glock by the penis
The cleanest cut fuck sluts
With the big humongous butts
I used to rub a butt
My style is Gucci like the hookers pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk
To push me into flamin 'em
Like that little nigga Damien
Glock 19 to my motherfucking cranium
Gang-thight gun toting motherfucker
Niggas in they brains thought biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em, I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggas dont want the friction
Told you before how I bring the drama
Slaying Larry Johnson and his grand mama!

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga when I get busy, throw ya hands in the sky nigga I got the illest of the ill mentality
Niggas be grabbing me, knowing that they rather be stabbing me
All up in my back, try'na  take my track
A nigga front throw a gat to the fool next one to move is getting blasted
As I release Master piece it's like indecent
Stuck to your ass like tissue when you're wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believin'
I'm marked with death hard to kill like Steven

A fist-full of bullets, a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run, so I grab my gun!

Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
From staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the blue suits
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricks

They wanna bury me, I'm worried, I'm losing my mind
Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfucking mack, put the pistol to my head

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin' the dice
Now roll em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G

I live Thug Life, and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
Gettin' high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo

50-shot clip if a nigga want test
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor

They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down
And facin' me now, what do I do?
These things that a Thug goes through
And still I rise

Hallo?Oh scheiße nigga...wieviel Uhr ist es man?
Oh gottverdammt...nigga weißt du wieviel Uhr es ist?
Oh scheiße, was zum fick ist los?Alles ok mit dir?
Nigga was zum fick ist falsch mit dir?

Wenn ich sterbe, scheiß drauf, dann will ich zur Hölle
Weil ich ein Stück scheiße bin, es ist nicht schwer zu erzählen
Es ist macht kein Sinn in den Himmel zu kommen mit den Guten, gekleidet in weiß
Ich mag schwarze Timbs und schwarze Hoodies
Gott würde mich vielleicht wirklich streng behandeln
Den ganzen Tag nicht schlafen, ich kriege meinen Schwanz nicht gelutscht
Abhängen mit den guten, faulenzen im Paradies
Scheiß drauf, ich will Waffen tragen und Würfelspiele spielen
Mein ganzes Leben wurde ich als schlechtester berücksichtigt
Lügte meine Mutter an, stehlte sogar ihre Handtasche
Verbrechen nach Verbrechen, von Drogen zur Erpressung
Ich weiß, dass meine sich Mutter wünschte, dass sie mich abgetrieben hätte
Sie liebte mich sogar nicht so wie sie es tat als ich jünger war
Saugte an ihrer Brust nur damit ich meinen Hunger stillte
Ich frag mich wenn ich sterbe, ob sie dann weint?
Vergebe mir für mein disrespekt, vergebe mir für meine Lügen
Die Mutter meiner Kinder acht Monate, ihre kleine Schwester zwei
Wer hat Schuld für beide von ihnen?
Ich schwöre bei Gott ich will meine Pulsadern aufschneiden und den Scheiß beenden
Magnum an den Kopf halten, und drohen die Scheiße durchzuziehen
Und drücken, bis das Bett, komplett rot ist
Ich bin froh dass ich tot bin, ein wertloser scheiß Buddha Kopf
Der Stress baut sich auf, ich kann nicht
Ich kann nicht glauben dass ich an Selbstmord denke
Ich will aufhören, ich schwöre bei Gott ich fühle dass der Tod mich ruft
Nein du würdest es nicht verstehen
Siehst du es ist wie das was Crack mit Pookie gemacht hat, in New Jack
Außer wenn ich rüber gehe gibt es kein Weg mehr zurück
Sollte ich auf den Bahngleisen sterben, wie Remo in Beatstreet
Würden Leute auf der Beerdigung so tun als würden sie mich vermissen
Die Mutter meiner Kinder küsst mich, doch ist froh dass ich gegangen bin
Sie kannte mich und wusste dass ich etwas mit ihrer Schwester hatte
Ich erreiche meine Spitze, ich kann nicht sprechen
Ruf mein nigga Chic an, sag ihm dass mein Wille schwach ist
Ich bin es leid dass nigga lügen, ich bin es leid dass schlampen glotzen

Ayo Big, ayo Big

*Herzschlag verlangsamt sich*
Bitte legen sie auf, und versuchen sie erneut anzurufen

What about ten years from now?

Ten years from now, where do I want to be? I wanna be...just livin' man, just
Living comfortably with my niggas man, in a pool and shit, smoking plenty indo
You know I'm saying? I got my wife, just lounging with my wife you know i'm
Saying?
With my daughter, her daughter, you know just laid back, just chillin
You know i'm saying? Living all my niggas is living where I think I be? Ten
Years
I don't think I will see it for real dogg for real man, that shit ain't
Promised man
I don't think my luck is that good, I hope it is but if it ain't, so be it, I'm
Ready

You got it going on
Your dead wrong....

Yo Bigs, man, what's wrong man?
You look like you got problems man

Hey yo man, psh man..
It's this fuckin' bitch, man!
Shit, I know I ain't s'posed to have no feelings for these hoes out here man, but
Yeah man... done wrote a rhyme 'bout the bitch man

Yeah, dedicatin this to you man
Cause my man 50 Grand told me straight up and down man
I ain't 'sposed to love NO ho
Knahmsayin? I tried to tell her 50
I got three rules in life
I'm not to be played with, played on or played out
I'mma drop it like this

Lyin' in my bed, I'm lookin' at four walls
Echo in my head sayin' I got a lot of gall
Grippin' my cap, my pen in my teeth
Thinkin' what this ho said, she called me a thief
She said I stole her heart, and didn't leave a trace
I told her I was sorry, and she said "get out my face"
Walked out my door with my Walkman in my pocket
Playin "Love Is a House," and thinkin how she jocked it
When she had the key, to open up my door
Adore, that Prince scan that bought me on the floor
I know that she loved me, I couldn't ever fake it
I say go buy a pie, the girl would go bake it
Makin' a record was important to me
More important than her that's what made her flee, see
The mistake was not payin' no mind
All her posse said we was "two of a kind"
I call her back twice, your sister said you're broke
She said "when you left, your ears was full of smoke
Chokin' on a cigarette, you don't even smoke!"
Jumped in the train station put in a token
Coulda been my partner, amigo, my peer
Just waitin' for them three words that all girls wanna hear
"I love you," huh, you would start to cry, if
I would reply with I.L.Y
Then I tell your friends that you played me out
Said I wouldn't say "I love you" just to make you shout
So I, call up 7 digits that would pick up your phone
Your sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home
I heard you in the back cryin' up a storm
Screamin' how you wish that I never was born
"I hate him! I hate him!" That's what she kept sayin
She'll come to her senses is what I kept prayin'
But now I'm gonna lay the cards on the line
Just say that you hate me, or say that you're mine
I said, when I played ball you was in the stands
When I was sick, you held my hand
It was hard to say before, but now I can
Bitch, I love no ho, fuck ya!

I don't give a fuck about'cha
Take a long walk off a short pier, bitch
Tryna to take bankrolls
Bum bitches outta here 50, man
Now check this

Come to my crib, she say, "B.I.G. listen
I don't like the way you been dissin'"
Feel like I been kissin' other bitches cause my lips feel chapped
I tell you "it's from the blunts," you ain't tryin to hear that
Now I'm Henny'd like a fuck? What's the riff?
Who I'm sleepin with? I ain't got the time
To shoot the gift to hoes, I'm tryin to take bankroll
I ain't fuckin nobody, case closed
You hit the lights and decide to doze off
No kiss goodnight, didn't take your clothes off
And my dick is harder than a rock
Nobody to cockblock but you's a hardrock
The fuck you think I am, gay?
I ain't got no time to play I ain't got nothin' to say
Bounce out the crib, just to see my man 50
And what's up with B.I.G
And the O.G.B., you know they keep plenty hookers
And I ain't a bad looker
So I see one ho that I like yeah, oooh
Shit is cool

Trust no hoes, all they want is bankroll
That's what I'm tryin to tell you now baby
My man 50 done schooled me to all y'all hookers
Knahmsayin? I ain't lame to this
Can't spell game without me, the B.I.G

The weak or the strong, who got it going on?

Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
"Hail Mary, full of grace"
Smack the bitch in the face, take her Gucci bag
And the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken, honey
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
The head honcho, swift fist like Camacho
Her hitting the floor and me hitting the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humping around and jumping around
Jacked her then I asked her, "Who's the man?" She said, "B-I-G"

Put you in the back with the derelicts, yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits, no time for the crack rock and shit
Smooth as Teddy Pendergrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
For the burner, catch a body, I got styles like karate
Jiu-jitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe, hope you got a rope to hang yourself
What you think, I'm stupid? My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep, huh, yo, Big, you're dead wrong

Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
That told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin'
In front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin'
To make some money to feed my daughter
To all my peoples in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's all good baby, baby, check it

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine

Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky

Now honies play me close like butter played toast
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak

Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear

Now we sip champagne when we thirsty

Damn right I like the life I live
And it's all, it's all good

Not that it makes a difference, cause I'm mowing you down with the quickness

Then go undercover, we leave 'em in gutters, they claim to get down
But then who was the sucka that squealed on the murder?

Get 'em when I get 'em, Bone don't let up

We're standing strong, so come on, so come on, get your flow on, get your flow on, We're standing strong, so come on, so come on

Hi I'm Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mom
I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he liked to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the house

Even though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he chose

My son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my son's life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dying

We are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of that

He appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating

And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my son's life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in music

I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generous

The thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave

Huh, check it up, check it up now
Check it up, check it up now
Huh, huh, hm

I got a bitch that suck my dick til' I nut
Ain't that a slut? Hell naw, you be doin' too much
She even take it in the butt, nigga, yeah, yeah, what?
Boy, you know you love it when I call you Big Poppa
You talkin' shit but whenever I'm gone, you be ringin' my phone
Bring yo' ass on home
I roam in Lexuses and Benzes, this is the fly way
With the flyest bitch, gettin' head on the highway
Sucked all day, smokin' blunts, countin' cheese

It ain't never too much to freaky for ya
The sexy things you do, they put me in the mood
Can't get enough of the things that you do

Every time we touch, you givin' me a rush
Look in to your eyes, I'm feelin' your vibe
I'm losin' all control
You're takin' me to Ecstasy
Boy, you got that good thang, so come put it on me
I love the way you do it to me baby
Boy, I'm gettin' hot, can't wait to get you home
Let you hit from the back, sex game strong

That I ain't givin' it up to nobody but you

The big don’t fit, use your lips cause..
Fuckin' with me, you know what you get
You be havin' a fit over my lip, yeah
I'm feelin' kinda itchy for a quickie
Me eat you, I beat you
Baby, you can do whatever you want to me
These bomb-ass chicks ain't ready for you
Take it real slow, you can take your time
Baby, you know....

Flip funk in the UK...
Pass the ill fill...
And I can feel all the Flava...
Kicking from the US neighbour...
Kick all the Flava...
Do the Mack do, what you wanna do, you savour
This step is called the BOU to T
Bust the rhymes for free, I gets down
Mack is inside your town
Busting lyrics tourture like the missiles slow you down
Sup with B.I.G, pass the microphone to you so I can take a puff

Who throw gats to Guiliani?
Flows tighter than pigeon punani, try me, die G
Dangerous, since my daddy bust me out the tip of his dick
Biggie Smalls with the Wickedest shit
Spit clips, niggas split like bananas
Flavour like Tropicana; orange, mango, peach
I strangle each
Negro for they dough
Niggas get to bendin', got two cases, one pending
560 V-12 engine, niggas swimmin'
In 929 Mazdas, Tammy and Natasha
The menage-a-trois is at my crib
Like Ill and Al Skratch smokin' 50 sacks in the back of Ac's
Windows cracked, so sit back relax
Craig, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

Well, BANG! let's kick it off like a butt
More fakes than Allen front to leave you lost like a treasure hunt
From now on, y'all crossed the land
Craig Mack's the upper hand with more rhymes than the beach got sand
You're an MC, yo my original job is that mistaken raps'll guarantee you look like a slob
I got more rhymes than kids got the measles
You shooting needles, we are bigger than The Beatles
I crush , hush with the Super Sunday rap
We're trotting to the cot cause your style turns back to mush
I flip out the funk off the frame
Now you know my name- Mackalicious, ain't you got a king?
Shaking from here to back to Breckwood
On One FM rap show, the illest flow that you ever heard on your radio
Biggie Smalls, my motherfucking man, take the microphone and kick the wicked like a man

I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna KILL FOUR PEOPLE!
Forget the dames, gimme the range and the wain
My niggas up the pawn drop top jag walls
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's the superstar status apparatus, more wings than clutches
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Lick off the wine as my seats recline
I won a presidential Rollie
So I crush MC's, the guacamole making Robin scream "Holy Molly!"
Big Poppa, off the caper, I'm that paper crusader
Playing Sega in a widebody blazer
And if you don't know now you know, my flow you pick like an afro
Wet like Soul Glo

...You don't stop...

Big Poppa, throwing niggas off of cliffs, smoking spliffs
Disappear with my bitch in a Mitsubishi Eclipse
Read my lips, I kill you, blood will spill too
Did I say thank you? I grant you
Three wishes cause I be the genie
Niggas is ass out like fat  bitches in bikinis
Read between the lines, see what I see?
I see the diary of a sick bastard
Junior M.A.F.I.A blaster
Rugers on the hips, bought coke to fill chips
More burners to fill clips, check it...
Putting coke in corner store bodegas
In the back room playing Sega Streetfighter 2
I'm inviting you, get your writing crew and their dopest rhymes
I'll get up in that ass every time
Lyrically I'm untouchable, uncrushable
Getting mad blunted in a 600 Benz
Ask your friends who's the illest
Licking shots niggas screaming Biggie Smalls tried to kill us

I get ill...
It's time for a funk refill of rhymes that I kill as I shoot 'em in the grill
MC's, I'm not impressed
Your best don't just throw your chest
Where's the bullet proof from the wool vest, won't matter
Your chest will shatter
On the tip of my dick baby you are the badder
MC's I feel funktified
They tried but now they died

Biggie bring big bowls of beef
Backing bitch niggas down burners bring bundles of belief
Common thief slash drug chief, syndicated
Went from 10k to 24k, competition hated, J.M. sedated
Quarantine
Big for president, busting shots past your spleen
9 millimeter dreams, Mac 11 nightmares
Which MC's do you fear? Big Poppa, Junior M.A.F.I.A, nuff said
Niggas disrespect just I dead

Just I dead
MC's turn red from the shot I lick, Ceaser sick
Too much shagging, too much drinking, too much thinking
MC's are blinking the third eye when I pass by
Mackalicious got the sweet potato fried for you motherfucker, I... touch the microphone
I do or die, make the hardest motherfucker cry when a MC pass by
I flip rhymes off the top of my head just like Raid I spray MC's until they dead
A vocal volcanic microphone, robotic tonic atonic
The microphone is mine so MC's panic
I get down for my ground
You could see I met James Brown in your town
Flipping funk on a Friday on my malware
In the highway, takes MC's by the driveway, driveway
Slow ill flow, so you know, head to toe
Ill bend flows when I go...
From flow to top ten... to dough...
Flow ill flow, Badboy down said so
So Biggie Smalls my man, take command
Turn each MC you see into sand

I stretch the funk like my name is Plastic Man
Eating MC's out the can in my hip-hop wonderland
I got the venom like the snake's got the venom, I put it in 'em
Faces turn bluer than my denim
But don't look down though my name is David Banner
Flipping green on the mic cause they can't control my gamma
So stop hogging us, Mack's the erogenous
So rap full grown, see us the acrogynous
There ain't a rapper liver than the rebel
My boys don't carry treble, eat MC's like a vegetable
Crack a few stepping on the pedal
Heavy off the medal, life's stronger waiting for the sun to settle
King MC, for that I thank the LORD
Your vocal chords sometimes you get the style bored
As we break it down, Biggie Smalls represent Brooklyn your hometown

Giving pleasure in the Benzito
Hitting fannies, spending chips at Manny's
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Mxwaah! May you rest in peace
.44 and 54 draws
As my pilot, steers my Lear- yes, my dear
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
I'm Big dangerous you're just a little vicious
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all

It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada
Fuck Poppa, you got to call me Francis M.H. White
Was told in shootouts, stay low, keep firing
The most shady, Frankie baby
With my man Capone, dumbing, fucking something
Went from 10 G's for blow to 30 G's a show
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious'
Make it hot like a kettle get
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure

You don't stop, then we won't stop
'Cause we won't stop if you don't stop
You can be as good as the best of them
And you know that I'm bad than most of them

Frank White the Desperado used to rock the all-black Movado
The all-black El Dorado
All that and a bottle of Dom P
All that, think twice before you try me
And I'm tellin' you, they better stay out my way
'Cause this is the last time I'm warning you
And I ain't gonna say it no more
Is Brooklyn in the house without a doubt?
I'm the rapper with clout everybody yap about
Check it out guns, I bust em
Problems with my wife, don't discuss em
Coupes and Learjets, I lust them

If I'm on top, then you on top
And we won't stop, we all we got

I display, Hot 97 rhyme-ready
Cocked Mac-11, line steady
Mama said "fallin' in love with a thug is dangerous"
And you know she say facts
Your mom's an actress
Yeah whatever, how you gon' talk that trash?
Matter fact, laid back, let's get this cash
Like Tevin Campbell, I'm ready
To do what I do, continuously to get money

Mic Check
Bigger than Fred Wreck
Uh, Check it out

It don't stop, It don't stop
Watch the hit, Nigga

Smoking Spliff's, Disappear With my Bitch
In a Mitsubishi Eclipse
Read my lips, "I kill you"
Blood I'll spill true
Did i say "Thank you"
I grant you
Three wishes, cause i be the Genie
Niggas is Ass out
Like Fat Bitches in Bikini's

Read Between the lines
See what i see
I see the diary
Of a Sick Bastard

Junior M.A.F.I.A Blaster
Ruger's on the hip's

In the back room playing SEGA, Street Fighter 2
I'm inviting you
Get your writing crew, and They Dopest rhymes
I get up in that Ass, Every time

Getting Mad blunted as a 600

Benz, Ask your friends who's the Illest licking shot
Nigga's screaming, "Biggie Smalls, Tried to kill us"

Watch the hip, Nigga

Junior M.A.F.I.A, Representing Bucktown
Mac-11 Cocked back, Nigga's better duck down
Faced-Down, you know the routine the cream
Earrings the drama Biggie Bring
Lets get it

About Eazy...
Tell me how y'all felt, when you heard first that he had.. announced that he had AIDS, and then.. I guess...

When I found he had it, I was twisted. I was torn up for a couple minutes.
Just.. took me by surprise, because he was just with us, you know?
He was just with us, he was just hanging out with us. And I don't -- I didn't see..
I was not expecting to see a stamp saying 'AIDS' all on his body, but I couldn't see the man's signs, you know what I'm saying?
Nothing, not even a sickness, like coughs or nothing.
When I heard that my man was on the death-bed, it shook me up. S'crazy.

I know you're thinking, well god damn, What he drinking?
The crooked letter, no other beer feel better
I used to be a hustler, now I'm a, twenty-two brew guzzler
Other beers I'm not lovin' ya
Forget the great taste that's less filling
I'd rather have some Ides and some dimes in the crib chillin'
Or in the six relaxing, honey's in the back
Crackin' six-packs, rubbing my back
Big Poppa you all that
Thats what they whisper, hey mister
Do you have the beer with the eye on the twister
He points to the freezer, me being a playa
Big poppa, show stoppa, throw ya cans in the air!
From Bed-Stuy, to Van Nuys, St. Ides make eyes
Droop like chinese, so why try these
Other beers just dont pass the test
S-T DOT I-D-E to the S
And I'm out!

"Well, who is 'Biggie Smalls'?"

Notorious Biggie Smalls in full effect
Got my DJ Fifty Grand in the house, you know what I'm saying
I'mma nice LONG rhyme on this funky track
You know how we get down, yo

When the words from Big-man
Explode like an ash-can
While DJ Fifty Grand
Kick beats like Van Damme
That fighting ass nigga?
Yes, it's the B
I break with the bonus
Bumrush bums and bitch-ass opponents
Buck plugs out ya brain
Break your back bone
Send ya back home
Back to the wack zone
Try to underrate the heavy weight
But when I dominate, you couldn’t wait to play me on your tape
Press rewind, maybe two times or three times
Here to rhyme, to blind your mind like Moonshine
Biggie Smalls got bitches in Brazil, boy
Use a rubber if the bitch is on the pill, boy
The complete opposite of a kill-joy
Stick-ups, shoot-outs, hustling, I get ill, boy
Niggas run up, they say 'Big, I wanna battle ya!
I think I could burn ya!" from where, Attica?
Look at you, you're shaking like a pair of dice!
And when I rip ya, rob ya, roast ya then you'll say I'm trice!
Man, don't try to gas me or juice me
Smoke you like a loosie
I pack a MAC, you pack a deuce-deuce, G
So press up
Before you messed up
That's your best luck
The kinda sort, run you over in the 4 by 4
And the tag on your toe will read Derelict
Pass the blunt, I take a hit
Pass the drink, I take a sip
Pass the skins, I take a dip
Pass my loot, before I flip
Man, brother, man, brother man!
I thought you knew the pedigree of the B.I.G
Cut emcees like lumberjacks cutting trees
Rip microphones like Freddy rip kids
Like car rigs do bids
My burner's always there
To the back, to the side, to the front
Smoke a blunt, break ya like Ivana broke Trump
You little young chump
Yeah, reach for your gun
Make sure you get done
Be a ghost like Michael Landon
And the rhyme keeps flowing
Like the rabbit with the drum, I keep going and going
And showing MCs how to flow, yo
I smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffs the llello
"Be slow bro!
Slow down before you get slowed down, quick!"
Which burner you wanna get hit with, pick!
I'm the wrong nigga to be fucking with
So sit back and admit, Biggie Smalls got that hype shit!

Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!

Lyric enhancement is a must
That's why I bust
Dope raps like a burner bust caps
I'm used to making tracks
That's why my rap sounds like that
I get my props and all my pats on the back
B-I, double G-I-E Smalls
Who the nigga in the place? Watch him fall
Check all the pockets for some loot
Take the girl, knock the boots
If she's cute, I'm the pimp, she's the prostitute
Hey! Sippin' on the heineken
Ain't a rapper finer than
The B.I.G and Fifty Grand
Suckers better try again
Before you get lifted and twisted
You better smoke a spliff, kid I'm gifted
Fill it to the tip, with the dope shit
Nigga fifty-shot clip to my hip
Skip to my lou, special shout-outs to my crew
Fifty Grand and the OGB flucture through
I'm dynamite, out of sight on the mic
Three and two, Frank got ya sleeping with the night light
So wake up and smell the coffee
You're nothing but a softie
Rappers screaming "Biggie, get off me!"
Don't have me go off, G
Cause I'm just lukewarm
And I'm not the type to toot my own horn
But uh, toot toot!
I take my timbo boots
And just lose it
You fucking piece of bowel movement!
My tec got a long clip
Biggie Smalls got the hype shit!

Shout outs to Junior M.A.F.I.A, y'all know what time it is
My man Fifty Grand, and his man
Ayyo, my man Big O in the house
Recognize that OGB in full effect
I'm out

Ladies and Gentlemen
We're gonna ask you for some fanfare...the band fanfare because...ladies and gentlemen...sting has always gone ahead of itself
They have done it again and again and again
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten thousand fire sides
And if you know...and if you enjoy hip-hop...if you want one of the coldest brothaz out of North America...a brotha that gave you a song like
Juicy...
You hear a crew in Jamaica with something that goes like this
"Who the heck is this
Paging me in the morning
At the crack of dawning"
The Notorious....the Notorious...B.I.G...AKA bigge!

Hmmm, yeah

We take the good, we take the bad
It's not about what we had
We just tryna get by
We stay out of trouble
All we wanna do to get a little bit better
We take the joy, we take the pain
It's not about what you gain

Oh, this is the story of my life
Tryna keep the drama and the bullshit away
I stay so busy on my grind
I don't they even pay attention to the things that they say
Now we're makin' this money, gotta get it while I can
That's that nigga with the fake, bloaw!

We just tryna by

Pass the blunt
No matter how I did it, I had to stay winnin'
Plus I'm fuckin' bitches, ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'

We just tryin', tryin', yeah

Uh, uh, it's cold outside
Bad boy, bad boy
Uh, yeah
It's cold outside

What's going on?
What ya throwin on?

Biggie Smalls, who you represent?
The Brooklyn clique
Where the boots is tied tight, and the jackets is thick
Represent them thugs
Not them shearling rugs
Leathers that fasten
Sean Combs be lasting
1x to 5x, so no need for lost weight
Affordable, way more cheaper than the North Face
Flavors in the bubble-goose, so let your trouble loose
So no-one be seeing them thugs that's demeaning
The flavors in the city, it's a pity
Them other damn jackets don't fit me
They just plain itty bitty
Why can't a big guy stay fly?
Listen up, Polo Grounds down to Bed-Stuy
Stay fly in that Brooklyn Mint
And here's the main reason
Sitting in that jacket, man I know you be freezing
Flavors in the vest
Bulletproof on the chest
Keep the burner on the waist
And still dress to impress

Y'all should know this rap thing, I got it down to a size
Big goose underneath it, that's the metal appliance
And if we don't bust a cap on you so called gangsters
Don't front, you a little bit scared now, ain't ya?
Now this is '05, it's a brand new thing
'Bout time the rap game crowned a brand new king
I been sitting here squadding on this Tidal belt
When I drive it, watch how my rivals felt
It's the second coming of Black, so run and get your raps
And do a couple of dips, and run a few laps
I stay in first place with the style of a Lear
If you try to battle the kid you really gon' need a
Whole crew, not 2 man, 3 or 4
You gon' lead the whole posse, a masimore
Even then B, ain't no chance for ya
You fucking round with the rap gargantuans
Bad Boy, man easy pimp
When I'm dishing out the pain nobody exempt
You was good 'til your scam uncovered
Who the man in fatigues with the blicky?
That's the god, belove it
And he cold like a bitch's heart
Yeah he cold and ridges hard
You don't want beef? Shit, don't start, man
It's B. Rob, I'm taking it back
D got Kim with the product, we cookin' crack

Pop off 'till I'm hard and grey
I'mma even see Al Green get shot down like Marvin Gaye
No disrespect, pardon me
Lotta dudes got locked down but few had heart to stay
Puff couldn't take Marph's demay
Sit your five-dollar ass before I make change, stay in your lane
'Cause only champs sip on pain
You the type to like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain

We up in the basement, you know what I'm saying?
DJ Enuff, my man Fresco
This is just me, the Notorious Biggie Smalls in full effect

Guaranteed to make heads rock, tote Glocks
Drop cops that mistake me for Rodney
Strictly head shots, I knock the twist out your dreadlocks
Who got the props? Biggie Who got the Glock? Biggie But who is he?
You can't get my description, you need a prescription
Two doses of the ferocious
Feel the weight when I'm crushing 'em, bumrushing 'em
Stuffing 'em, I put the pressure on em, hon
Lord a mercy, Jesus Christ, He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
It's me, the Notorious B.I.G-G.I.E Smalls, yo!
This is for chumps that don't know who I am
I had a song on the soundtrack "Who's The Man?"
The single was dope, but the movie didn't slam
Emcees is like JJ's moms, "Damn, damn damn!"
Is it because I rip the props or beat the cops?
I got more dough than a pizza shop
Your style is played out like Arnold and that "whatchu talkin 'bout Willis?"
7 Mac Elevens, 8 .38s nine 9s, ten MAC 10s, the guns never end!
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K!

Black Cadillac, on vogues
Sittin' back thinkin'
Thing ain't the same no mo'
We want Biggie
Big up to the east-coast Brooklyn don
Heads still bouncin'

So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screaming
MC's got to feel one
Caps, I got to peel some
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
Says who - says me, the lyrical
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glocks

We want the funk!
Live and die for the funk

Aw, it's nothing but funk in this motherfucker here!
Ayo, it's Redman dog, you know the deal
I'm watching New Jack City in my steering wheel
Man I love for the funk, I'll kill that wheel
Nigga fucking large I'm in the NFL
Killer, the man on fire like Denzel
I rock steady, my heat'll make your wind-mill
That's real, dot, R-A-W, straight out my mother womb
Right to the rubber room, I'm psycho, automatics
Since a younging, blowing funk boosts with half-sticks
I ain't give a fuck, now I'm trying to own a mountain
Standing on it yelling "regular!"
B. Smalls, Nate Dogg on the same beat
We fuck hoes, send 'em home like the Yankees
Brick City, yeah nigga, a threat
That's how I act when Bad Boy cut Killa a check
Yep, haha

Real talk, nigga, Flip Mode Squad's in the building
Put your ones up, tribute the god, look
All gathered around, bounce to the funk
Got the whole club stink with the aroma of the skunk
Now, bang it out the trunk, nigga, ain't nothing change
Rep Big in a horde, like he still on St. James
Check it, nigga gon' see why we try
We continue to rep the funk in the name of the god B.I
Get dressed, mamis try to step up in the spotlight
We honoring one of the greatest,  yes we gotta rep him right
Homie I ain't done, let me keep giving you funk shit
Busta Bust does just what he do, now let me run shit
Yeah, peep heat we bringin', rep the funk to the fullest
Still, keep we keep drillin', niggas all up in they head
'Cause I said we always will, and
Put it down for Big-Heavy, still B.K. swinging

Who shot ya?
See your niggas running without ya
Because the AK-47 sing like Sinatra
You know these niggas really give you no option
Now you sitting there, left behind like an abortion
You know NY do not give a fuck about beef
You know why? Because we started the rap scene
Rapping so dirty with that flow, you niggas sound clean
I was up in New York until I was a preteen
I do damage with that Uzi in my mouth
But the average rapper do not know what he talking about
And I guess it’s because rap changed
But they would never last back when the ‘90s reigned
I know that I’m really just ahead of my time
And I know these other niggas really looking for mines
And I’m the realest on the line
Niggas get lyrical like the holy Qur’an
I’m really looking for that good shit
Other niggas looking for the stereotypical hood shit
So what’s good? Is you strapped, motherfucker?
Is you “that” motherfucker?
Is you rich, motherfucker?
How many gang wars will it take before we lose another brother by mistake?
And If you don’t like what I say, I don’t give a fuck
Press rewind so you can hear it again

Clip to Tec, respect I demand it
Slip and break the, 11th Commandment
So you know where to tell jake, lame nigga
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Bailey's

Open your fucking mouth, open your, didn't I tell you
Can't talk with a gun in your mouth huh?
Bitch-ass nigga, what?.. Who shot ya?

Light Speed, blazing Chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate thai weed
Or we might be sipping on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas

Notorious B.I.G, lyrics cold pushing 'em
MC wanna get with me, but they're pussy, I'm douching em
Yes, I got the ridiculous conspicuous hardcore flow
Don't ya know?
Don't ya know, in the house let me introduce
The hardcore nigga with the timberland boots
Tied up to the top, but when I drop
Oh, pass that nigga, don't stop don't stop

Ricky Ricky Ricky, can't you see?
MCs wanna flip on me
Why? Because I'm the B-I-G-G-I-E
Niggas wanna get with the nigga with the mad props
But my timberlands are cocked up
Niggas wanna get locked up
But when they get fucked up they get cut up
They bleed when I retrieve
My MCs don't want nobody's problems
The notorious!

Alright, recognise the pedigree
Here to let you know, if ya
Feel the funk just dripping to your buttcheeks
Grab a honey, if she don't wanna speak
Throw your hands in the air
Wave 'em like you don't care

Whatchu want, nigga whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Am I hard hard core, harder than a Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with the spliff
And the pastor preachin' "He was a good man"
Ya fuck with the high guy ya die

Time to bring 'em back

???, Brooklyn
Two Uptown bullies, Brooklyn Biggie
Jet fuel abusers, sippin' ?Patruise?
+Once Upon A Time In America+'s muse

The Fuck Happened to the home of the brave
Niggas running off headed to the grave
Black president, don't matter
Shit just getting worst life is shattered
A land of freedom is flipping out
All I want is a life without a doubt

Thug life, we all been through it
Life's a struggle though it's not split
Illuminati or whatever the fuck they go by
They the reason why the world so dry
I'm just a nigga tryna live my life
Everyday staying away from the tip of a knife
Or the the fire from a fucking 9 millimeter
This damn Gangasta life is that of a cheater
I'm starting to think we living in a trash can
Jus' waiting to be swallowed up bu the Klu Klux klan

Every night sleeping with a common dream
That everyone be on the same team
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
Bitch how could this get any worse than it is worst
America might as well be cursed

Let's say there are many times I looked
And saw reflections of my son
I argued sometimes, consulted;
I saw results, and said "Well done."

I thought of him constantly
And silently asked "Why?"
I tried fervently
And just cannot say goodbye

I lived with visions twined and twisted
Passion so cold
And withered thoughts, battered and shattered
I dreamed dreams
Cherished memories
Housed friendship
And promises that mattered

In the end
Time is treasured;
But love for my son?
It's everlasting

I'mma smoke this nigga, man..
What the fuck y'all doin' man? You fuckin' with the jam master
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight)
I ain't fuckin with you niggas, I ain't fuckin with you niggas
This stupid nigga, man
Fuck that
Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo!

The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Blood rushin', concussions, ain't nothing
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumping

What, what, what, what?
I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at, these fucking
You're bleeding lovely, with yo, spirit above me
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryin' to break me
Skeeted out, weeded out, cleanin' out -- the block
For distances, givin' long kisses bitch!

Frank White the menacing, Chron-Chron's the medicine
Slugs hit your chest tap your spine, flatline

Time, for you to die

Fuck that!
That nigga tryna be on that up and coming shit, FUCK THAT!
I ain’t the type to toot my horn, but toot toot motherfucker! I’m the nicest nigga in the game, man! Face the motherfucking facts man!
You fuckin' with the other side! You can’t see me! You can’t see me! In a fistfight you won’t SEE me nigga!
Sick of this bullshit
Only reason I ain’t naming no names, is so I don't give these  bitch-ass niggas a chance to make a record coming back just to sell a few units
Faggots!
Old dirty half-ass niggas, man..

1 Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
8 It's all good baby, baby, check it

9 It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine

13 Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight

17 Born sinner, the opposite of a winner

21 Now honies play me close like butter played toast

25 Livin' life without fear
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school

30 We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us

34Damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive

Brand new new Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Biggie!
They call this one White Chalk, pt. III!
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Put it on!

Here's the situation
Larce got shot, now he facin'
Heaven or hell
But he living to tell
Who fucking did it
I got my crimey down wit' it
Just a grimy as me, slimy as me, check it
I got a long list of names and addresses
Even know the store where his momma buy her dresses
She gon' be the first one to ride in a Hearse son
Worse come to worse I'll kill his sister
I'll know he'll miss her
They just a family, other half of me
Them niggas scared of me
I hope they prepared to be
Shot at, hit up with baseball bats
Thrown in the back of the Ac' with a trunk full of rats
Drive to Brooklyn and back
Way up in the back where the bums sleep at
Look him in the eye, 'You wanna die, don't ya?'
If you could change everything you did, you would, won't ya?
But you can't, 'cause my brother can't breathe
Watching him bleed in the hospital - I had to leave
All I wanna do is kill your crew
Your grand moms might get wet on the church-house steps
The beef is set, whatever, show you the meaning of pressure
You can't measure, the pain that's inside - homicide
You can run but you can't hide
When the Benz with the tint's in front of your residence
Everybody on the stoop getting bent
White Chalk

Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?

Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, If I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and im mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause im rappin'
They asking me what happend
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep they taking polaroids
And im tryna' use the phone but they making noise
Man I wish I had my Glock cause its major
Im making shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't, leave me alone thats my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfucking murder
Im making collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talking shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to be socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshitting bitches ain't changing me
I came straight up out of gutta' I was saved from hell
Im a thug I was raised in jail, now im out on bail

Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?

I'm sticking ice picks on the tip of ya dick
And the pastor preaching "He was a good man."
You the same motherfucker yelling "Look up in the sky!"
I'm on some old neck shit
Suplex shit, hardcore sex shit
And TEC shit, whatchu want nigga?!

Into flamin' 'em, like that little nigga Damien
I tricked 'em -- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
Slam Larry Johnson and his Grandmama
Whatchu want nigga?!

When I get busy, throw your hands to the sky nigga
All up in my back, trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack, I ain't have problems like that
A nigga front? Throw the gat to the fools
Tears don't effect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G
Disrespect me? My potency is deadly
Once the venom hits the cerebellum
My lips get chapped, and my hards start swellin'
Keep the nine millimeter by the Peter
To kill a motherfucker, don't a think feel sweeter
Oooohh, it make my head hurt, the blood spurt
The robbery expert's berserk

My name is Christopher C.J. Wallace
My dad was the greatest rapper ever!
And his legacy lives on

If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads, fuckers

Gold tooth shine like TA-DOW!

I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me

*Beat Fades Out*

Westsiiiiddee! Haha

Top Dogg, bite em all
Nigga burn the shit up
D-P-G-C my nigga turn that shit up

Thug niggas drug dealers yeah they giving it up
Lowlife, yo life

Taking chances while we dancing in the party for sure
Slip my ho a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches looking at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swanging my hair
Bitch quit talking, Crip walk, stay down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relieving your stress

All my niggas on the East Side, throw up your guns
All my niggas on the West Side, throw up your guns
All my niggas from the East Side, throw up your guns
All my niggas from the West Side, throw your guns up
Niggas from the East Side, throw up your guns
Niggas from the West Side, throw up your guns
All niggas from the East Side, throw up your guns
All my niggas from the West Side, throw up your guns
All my niggas from the East Side, throw your guns up
Ha ha ha, yeah nigga, Outlawz yeah, Thug Life
Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah, energy makes plenty of enemies, you feel me?
Throw your guns up!!

Uh, what)
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

Those the ones I like cause they don't get nathan but penetration
Gar-bage
I turn like doorknobs
As I lay down laws like Alan Kopit
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it?
The sex is just immaculate from the back
I get
And sing the break, uh)

One more
Give me one more
Chance, and make me

Death stroke—tongue all down her throat
I'm through—can you sing the song for me boo?

Biggie, give me, one more

Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in ’em
High fashion, flying into all states
Isn't this great?
Your flight leaves at eight

Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre` duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can i bring my gat?
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggas like i was duck huntin'
Cause all we wanna do is...

Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my peice
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love i'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a BAD BOY
Niggas wanna front, who got your back?
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat?
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks!

In a tight dress, i think i might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, How to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaician rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jacques got the Glock in his waist and
If money smell bad than this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin out my palm
I'm hittin' skins again
Niggas start to look out, a kid got choked out

So i can put hickies on her chest like Li'l Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Don Perrignon
That's that

Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit

Repeats until fade out

What advice would I give to young rappers? Take control of your shit, don't -- don't be the type of rapper.. Don't be a stupid rapper.

When you talk about... New York...
The first thing that comes to your mind is B.I.G., like...
That's the king! I don't think there's no other king out there
Nobody could take that, that, that crown from him right there!
The legacy of B.I.G. is something real deep, man
Go back to a bunch of roots, man, Notorious about family and keepin' it tight
That, that's one of the best that ever did it!
Represented what he represented, did what he did
Youkno'Imean?
He put Brooklyn on his back
He represented the hood, he represented New york City
Respect to my dude, man!
I love you man!
Just like you hear, man
B.I.G. Forever... youkno'Imean?
M.A.F.I.A. Gang!
Rest In Peace B.I.G.!

My style is harder
Than the nipples on a freak
Who the fuck can compete
With the brother with the hardcore speak
When I speak I leave MC's speechless
Nigga repeat this, I leave you teethless
Believe this
Oh God, it's over, Jehova!
When I slay ya jump in the Range Rover
I slay ya

That's it! That's it! No more lyrics

That Brooklyn Bullshit, we on it!

          
        

Old school/new school need to learn though
Fucking with Biggie Smalls, it ain't safe
Representing for the queen, her royal highness

Catch this one bubonic plague
In your head, back, chest, arms, and legs
When I'm coming through grab your cranium for alternatum
Son, I stay subterranium
My subliminals mix with criminal chemicals
Got more milky syllables than alphabet cereal
Place your bet and your whole entourage will get wet
That's a promise 'cause Idon't make threats
I'm a graceful poet with sadistic ballistics
Above and beyond all that other bullshit
Linguistics aggressive antiseptic
Nerve-wreckin', concepted on consistent contestants
My deviant deliverance
I launch flows like torpedos
At any god-given episode
I be destined to flip so much funk shit
And do niggas better than the government
Keith Murray wrecks this with various combinations
I'm sick, manifestation
Oh my god, it's the hardest, I make entourages
And crews see mirages, Mary J. Blige is
God, gotta have my crew lace me up now

Get live motherfuckers. Get live motherfuckers!!

Hearing the coach scream ain't lifetime dream!

Album cover

Brooklyn, stand up
Bad Boy, Flipmode

If you feel the funk drippin' through ya buttcheeks
Grab up on a honey, if she don't wanna speak
The Notorious!

To my motherfuckin' man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin' comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin' her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
Why you wanna..
Rest with the niggas on that real blood-spill shit
My rapping tactics are drastic
So if you wanna see my pedigree
You better be, filled with energy, niggas never gettin' me

Ya know, if ya
Feel the funk just drippin' to ya buttcheeks

That's what I was...I wasn't killing myself shit
Fuck,if I was gay,I wouldn't have to worry about nothin'
I could just lay up,and be in heaven when I die

When I die,fuck it,I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit,it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense going to heaven with the goodie goodies
Dressed in white,I like black Timbs and black hoodies
No sleeping all day,no getting my dick licked
Loungin' in paradise,fuck that shit
I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I've been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother,even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime,from drugs to extortion
I bet my mother wish he got a fuckin' abortion
Sucking on her chest,just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I die,would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect

I wasn't even like
"How am I feeling right now?I feel like killing myself"
....It wasn't like that,I was just thinking like
"Damn,stressed up in the same fucking room"

My baby mother's 8 months,my little sister's 2
Who's to blame for both of 'em
I swear to God I wanna just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head threaten to pull shit
And squeeze..until the bed's,completely red
I'm glad I'm dead,a worthless fucking Buddha head
The stress is building up,I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind,I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' calling me
Nah,you wouldn't understand..
You see it's kinda like what crack did to Pookie
In New Jack,except when I cross over,
There ain't no coming back
Should I die on the train tracks,like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
She knew me and her sister had something going on
I reached my peak,I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic,tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lying,I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter fact,I'm sick of talking

Yo whattup man,did you hear that new toot
Shit,nigga was talking 'bout how I fucked yo bitch,you know all that Shit and he was dissin' and shit
I was like "Yo,what?"then I look in the back seat
This is true talk,can't make this shit up
This mo'fucka look in the back seat and was like
"Oh shit,B.I.G!Lemme get a autograph"

I like my fleak,and tell me like
I got on...

Earlier this day in Los Angeles,Wallace,
Also known as Biggie Smalls was shot from a
Passing vehicle
He had been named Rap Artist of The Year at the
Billboard Awards 1995

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh, you heard me!

I stay, dressed, to impress
As they watch TV in the Lex, they know
Except how I'm gettin' home tomorrow
Cease'll drop you off when he see his P.O
Reach the gate, hungry, just ate
Riffin', she got to be to work by eight
I state, "You know what you do to me?"
Then I whipped it out, rubber? no doubt

Biggie a nasty boy!

Screamin', she fiendin' for the semen
Me bein' the man that I am
Roll the chron'-chron' in the dark pronto
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? what?

Keep a gat for cats try to test me
They just fans like DeNiro, Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin' on
Ask P., leave it up to me
She like the way the dough fold up, rolls roll up
Dripped to death, iceberg apparel
Call me Cease cause I keep em, we can go freakin'
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin'? Uhh

Look in the sky
Wonder why
Most MCs alibis
Won't comply
With my style of rhyme
Or rhyming or rap
It's not a trap
My rhyme just snap --

And we were laughing and laughing, like "You ain't never gonna be on Video Musicbox, man..'

Mozzle, mozzle
Run around, mozzle and pop
Yeah I put that on pops

We wanted to find a way to get on the map, fast..
So, that birthed The Techniques. Two DJs, and Chris was THE MC

This is the wail of a tale
Of a male who gotta pay my bills
And I'll nail 'em in to sail the seven seas--

Yo, check it
Call Lil' Cease

'96 Catalog
Get money, uh

How you figure that your team can affect my cream?
Gold and platinum plaques since I stepped on the scene
Know what I mean? Peep the scene, Jacuzzi full of women
She hitting me and him and him, much love like Wimbledon
While niggas screaming 'killa', I'm overseas in my villa
With my masseuse, nothin' illa
Frank switch the plan, cop the Lexus Land
C-Gutta, Roc-a-fella 400's and better
Lil' Cease push threes with fives in his eyes
Knocking 'Not Gon Cry' by Mary Blige
I die for my niggas packing steel, chickenheads with sex appeal
Reveal sexual acts up in Capone's Ac'
The chocolate dimes watch the M.A.F.I.A. shine
Girls, bring your own, can't touch a dime of mine!

Know what I'm saying? Know what I'm saying dog?
Know what I'm saying dog?
Niggas, niggas, niggas on the beat
They don't even be knowing like, how we be rolling
You know what I'm saying? Like
We be like a big roller, group on you know what I'm saying?
The bananas is gone! The bananas is missing, dog!

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in coke and heroin to condos with elevators in them
Vehicles with televisions in them
Watch their entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can niggas stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push 6 coupes that's yellow
Bust clips that extend from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you're in
Crack bagging to sick of bragging of how my mink be dragging
Desert E's street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're fucking with the Devil

You know you're fucking with the devil right?
Straight up dog
Nigga talking all that bullshit, nigga trying to sell some motherfucking records
Nigga's a pussy, man. Straight up, man, he's a fake

When I bust my gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps

BIg up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stickup

Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer

Throw you in a choke; gun smoke, gun smoke
She said, "B-I-G," then I'd bust in her E-Y-E

Can you please explain to this court when these problems first began?

Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves ya rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't pushh me
The black demon, got the little hooker screamin'

**gunshots**
Guilty! Next case

I love niggas! I love niggas!
Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that which is me
And to all niggas that do it I love

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

Just in case dread wanna riff
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
Up North found first stop for the town
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the ruler

When I was young my M.O. was to go hail the Henny
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people feel your awkward
I tame I'm not lame
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo punk ass off propa'
This new place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged you know, bump my shit, bitch!

Yeah, yeah yeah
It's the Notorious Biggie Smalls
When I ain't on Fulton Street, sipping a Becks, steaming an L with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.
Or on Bedford Avenue with my DJ The Hitman 50 Grand and the O.G.B., getting tore down
We listening to the best of both worlds with Mr. Magic Spanish Fly and my main doo-doo stain, Mister Cee.
