Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a- when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe, believe

All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo
Lambo Murcielago
She go wherever I go
Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like-

Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin'
And a gnashin' of teeth in the dancehall
And who no have teeth gwan rub pon dem gums
Cuh when time it comes to my sound
Which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown fi many times
And it still have one more time left
Cuh the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder

Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is meltin' like Dali
Now everybody is movin' they body
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important

Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise

Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand

Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years
Ain't hug his son since the second grade
Uh, he never told-who he gonna tell?
We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green, it only means one thing
You ain't fuckin' with the clique

Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives

Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis

Fuckin' with my clique

With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leavin' this party

All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown
Bound...

Bound to fall in love

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party

Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound

I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is everything
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
We know we need it
You know we need it
That's why we need you now, oh, I
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents

But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

So why send oppression not blessings?
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
So I look to the light
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap  photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

Everything

Yes, God
Hallelujah

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It's something that the pastor don't preach
It's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap

Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Egyszer a Nap ugy elfaradt
Elaludt mely zold to olen
Az embereknek fajt a sotet
O megsajnalt, eljott kozenk

I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
"This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should menage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster

I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home

Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...

To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'til death but do your part, unholy matrimony

That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live

My by-any-means on
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Number one question they're askin'
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Baby, we livin' in the moment

This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans

God!

Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make-believe, rappin' about my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
'Cause my niggas still sellin' dope
Like they ain't on their third strikes
Campin' out in that corridor
Fuck you waitin' on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for twenty-three
Just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write
Trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit
Ungrateful niggas I don't like-rrrah!

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

They smile in my face is what I don't like
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Girls kissin' girls 'cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie, right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

Don't like, don't like

Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!"
I don't want relations, I just want one night
'Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm 'cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes 'cause I'm livin' life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like!
And, bi-bi-bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight

Nigga, I'm fuckin' insane, fuck is you sayin'?
Yo' ass been doin' the same
Shit, not doin' what you sayin'
Dang, I told yo' old bitch she was fuckin' a lame
Turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holdin' that pain
I just hope you been prayin'-bang bang!
Ridin' for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlives
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Goin' hard the whole night
'Cause I ain't goin' back to my old life, I promise

I done sold purple, I done sold white
Runnin' outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, another thirty for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas!

Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
Yeah we still hood famous

I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!

I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

Bam bam, 'ey 'ey 'ey
Bam bam bam, bam bam dilla
Bam bam 'ey 'ey 'ey
What a bam bam, bam bam dilla
How you feeling right now? Let me see your lighters in the air
Bam bam 'ey 'ey 'ey 'ey 'ey
What a bam
Let me see your middle finger in the air
Let me see you act up in this motherfucker
How you feelin', how you feelin, how you feelin' in this mother fucker, god damn
One thing you can't do is stop us now
Bam bam,'ey 'ey 'ey
You can't stop the thing now
Bam bam bam 'ey 'ey 'ey
Man it's way too late, it's way too late, it's way too late you can't fuck with us
Bam bam, 'ey 'ey 'ey 'ey 'ey
To the left, to the right
I wanna see everybody hands in the air like this
What a bam, bam

Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Huh?

I guess I get what I deserve, don't I

Faaaaaaaa
Faaaaaaaah

I told, I told, ay ay, I told you
Up in the morning, miss you bad
Sorry I ain't called you back
Same problem my father had
All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good
Momma pass in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga, pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

Taking all the stacks, oh
Stacks, oh

Twist the dope, lean and shit, sippin' Fanta
Wake up Versace, shit life Desiigner
Whole bunch of lavish shit
They be asking round town who be clappin' shit

I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit
White X6, killing on camera

How can I find you?
Who do you turn to?
How do I bind you?

If I don't turn to you
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

All day, nigga

How long you niggas ball? All day, nigga
How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga
How many runners do you got on call? All day, nigga
Swish, swish, how long they keep you in court? All day, nigga

Shoppin' for the winter and it's just May, nigga
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
For that Jesus piece, man, I've been saved, nigga
Just talked to Farrakhan, that's sensei, nigga
Told him I've been on ten since the 10th grade, nigga
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh
I don't let 'em play with me
I don't let 'em talk to me no kind of way
Uh, they better watch what they say to me
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day
Yeah, I still got the hundred with the small face, nigga
Might spend 50 racks on my off day, nigga
You a fake Denzel like the Allstate nigga
If you run into me, better have Allstate with yah
You a Rico Suave nigga
Ride 'round listen to Sade, nigga
If you ain't with us, you in our way, nigga
You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
'Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga
Your bitch got a ass, but my broad way thicker
Late for the class, in the hallway, nigga
Yeah, the dropout at it as always nigga, as always

I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed

How-h-how long you ball? All day, nigga
How long it take you to get this fly? All day, nigga
Pour some Hen out for my niggas that died, all day, nigga
And I keep a bad bitch on the passenger side, all day, nigga

I could do this all day, boy, I'm finna turn this bitch out
They need that Ye in the streets, boy, there's been a mothafuckin' drought
Don't really matter what I make, boy, you know I still go wild
Like a light skinned slave, boy, we in the mothafuckin' house!
Right now, you lookin' real sus right now
I swear I've been on this flight like a month right now
Stupid niggas gettin' money, Forrest Gump right now
Shout-out to Jackie Chan, I need to stunt right now
They've been lookin' at the Gram, I've been lookin' at the Grammys
Like, huh, that's us right now
24/7, 365 days, everybody gettin' paid
Niggas lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
People saying, "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
20 Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

Hands up, hands up, hands up
So won't you dance? ayy, ayy ayy ayy

Get low, alright
What up? Alright, alright
Stay low, alright

Whistling

Let me run to see who came undone
You've been right in my face
Let me run 'til you're off my case
Whooooa, whooooa

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

La da da da di da da-a, la-a
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more
Los Angeles

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said, "K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet"
I'ma put you on game, for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

Scary
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A

Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place

Please, no more parties in L.A

Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place
SWISH

Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
Right down there, right 'round there

Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you, got to
Love you, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost in... my doubt

Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild

And I need you now
Lost and found out

You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool

I'm living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

Till then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder

Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul

They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, hoe"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, hoe"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh Indian
And I...

See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Don't now, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
And forget all your cares
Ooh, life's a feeling and
Ooh, the body is a feeling

Turn me up!

I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin' on my dick like
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave

Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own...

The feelings don't really go away

Baby I don't, I don't need to own you

You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning

Ooh baby, ooh baby

Blazin, mi don't want dem
Mi need dem
Blazin
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt

I am a god

Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn menage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra

Ain't no way I'm givin' up. I'm a god

And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah I always find something wrong

Run away from me, baby, run away
When it starts to get crazy, why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away fast as you can

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em Grey Poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2

I can hold my liquor
But this man can't handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

Bitch I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh I wanna phone home

Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting, a' dat man do
Action thing yo a badman thing

I'm a badman you if know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel say we won't spray, like a aerosol can
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We agon' smile 'pon court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J

That's right, I'm in it
I'm in it
That's right
Damn Right
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes

Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
Just a badman thing, a' dat man do
That's right I'm in it

Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker
Who, where?

Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League
Uh, I be speakin' Swaghili

She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm."
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
It's somethin' that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

Let me hear that back

Whose fault?

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more
Let's call her names, names for sure

On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl"
You'll probably find one of them "I like art"-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely" - Chloe Mitchell

Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

Ohh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another mother fucking level!
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, God damn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked...
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now! Shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before!"
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well

Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one,  just like the mornin' sun
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are

Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...

Kanye West!
DJ Khaled!

Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you motherfuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
Flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

Come to meet me without

Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some Theraflu

What you need, what-what what you need

Hello, hello, hello white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony, or who gone try to embarrass ya?
I'mma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
Cause I'm richer, and prior to this shit was moving free base
Poli with the PDs now they got our shit on replay
Sorry I'm in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
Ain't that like Lebron James?
Ain't that just like D. Wade? Wait

Wussup, wussup, wussup, wussup
Wussup muh'fucka where my money at?
You gon make me come down to your house where yo mommy at
Mummywrap the kids, have 'em cryin' for they mommy back
Dummy that your daddy is, tell 'em I just want my racks
Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs
Who in that? Oh shit, it's just blacks on blacks on blacks
Hunnid stack-How you get it? Nigga layin' raps on tracks
I wish I could give you this feeling, I'm planking on a million
I'm riding through yo hood, you can bank I ain't got no ceiling
Made a left on Nostrand Ave., we in Bed Stuy
Made a right on 79th, I'm coming down South Shore Drive
I remain Chi-town, Brooklyn 'til I die

Take 'em on home, take 'em on home
I got what you need, what-what you need
Take 'em on home
What you need, what-what you need
I got, what you need, what-what you need
Tryna hurt my name, huh?

You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather 'round children, zip it, listen

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Can we get much higher?

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D

I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the God of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him, yuugh!
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four door

That's rare, nigga!
Shake that body, party that bod
Ric Flair, nigga!
Yeah, nigga!
Yeah
Woah
It's the new God flow, niggas

Step on they necks 'til they can't breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
Rodney King's, uhh
Cause we can't get along - no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww man, you sold your soul
Naww man, mad people was frontin'
Aww man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough, to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy, not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate, anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

Yeah nigga, yeah I had my, I had my Jesus piece since '94
I don't know what I, I don't know what y'all talkin' bout
And my eagle - still got it all in the bag, B
All I did was play possum
Yo, come on

Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the Mac-11
My big lion haven't ate since twelve, and it's after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin' their wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Say shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone? I said probably
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I'm not bow-legged but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G.O.D

G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
I don't know but I've been told
If you get fresh get all the hoes
I'm way fresher than all my foes
Somebody please pick out they clothes
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me

I love it though
I love it though, y'know?

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like this what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan

When the sun go down it's the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

Haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping Rose all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble, retracing my steps

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous

How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous

High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
Tell everybody I'm back in town
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, oh no
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine

One life, one night
That's all I need
Livin' the life 'til I die

I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich
21 Grammys, superstar family
We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action
I'm about that Farrakhan
Life is a marathon
I'ma shift the paradigm
I'ma turn up every time
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot
One time for a nigga really gettin' it
Two times cause we got the whole city lit
Advice to all my niggas, impregnate Bridget
So when she have a baby she gon' make another nigga
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches hah?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?
She spent her whole check on some Christians
And that girl ain't even religious
Walkin', livin', breathin' god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob, help him with the weight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
What you want?
You want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack?
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
Oh lord, oh lord
Bad bitch up in Equinox
Oh lord, oh my lord

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
Westside, Westside
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Come on, come on
And when it all falls down

I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

C'mon, c'mon
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon

It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?

I invented swag
Poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes

Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, but I'm about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain

Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I'm never going to jail

I made Jesus Walks, I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off
I'm done I'll hit you up mana...nah!

Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubana's with Castro in cabanas
Viva Mexico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we digging tunnels
Can't you see we gettin money up under you?

Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
Jay is chillin', Ye is chillin'
What more can I say? We killin' 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see we done bodied the damn lames
Lord please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne

Screamin'

Back in the lab and shit

My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
The night sky, yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah

I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout "how my neck look?"
Well... it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow

My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between

Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

All of the lights, lights, all of the lights

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

Fast life, drug life, thug life

Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know, yeah
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own

Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

Whoa, whoa

Your love is fadin'
I feel it's fadin'

I just fade away

Fade away
Fade away-ay-ay-ay
I think I think too much

Roll up, roll up; hold up, hold up; po' up, po' up
I love to... I wanna... I'm tryna...
I'ma rock the boat, work the middle 'til it hurt a little
Fuckin' with a real ass nigga
Fuck how you feel ass nigga
Bitch better act like you know better

Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, down inside
Yes, deep inside

Oh, I get lifted, yes

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go

You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch

Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition

Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women

Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago

Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
'Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job

Bow in the presence of greatness

You should be honored by my lateness

Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six

But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me

'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night

He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want

Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

Uh-huh

Right now
I need right now

And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, lil homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tore 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat
'Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep making that, keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me!"

Cause I'm comin' home again
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her, then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town

Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again

Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again

Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story
About how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, man

I need to call it off
I need to, I need to make it known
'nother one, something gone
Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn
Fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life
I'm living mine

All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay

Maybe it's cause she into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
Peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now, cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelins like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah, I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number-one Chief Rocka

None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK

Ohh, ohh, ohh
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go

I can't stop-op-op-op
I can't stop

This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball
Now who gon stop me? Who gon stop me huh?
Who gon stop me? Who gon stop me, huh?

Yeah, who gon stop me?
Who gon stop me?
No brakes, I need State Farm
So many watches I need eight arms
One neck but got eight charms
Who gon stop me huh?

Niggas talking, they bitchmade, Ixnay off my dicksnay
That's Pig Latin, itch-bay, who gon stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well, got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert, "Yes!" Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations you're just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
I can stop

Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah's circle
I wrote the verse that I hope will hurt you

Beat the odds, beat the Feds
It wouldn't be wise to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Give me one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearin no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy, they don't have no proof
I'm three steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gamblin
Lucky lefty, I expect a seven
I went through hell, I'm expectin heaven
I'm owed, I throwed and I stuck to the G-code
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere
Okay here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to havin bunny ears like broke, like nope
Like ha, I ain't no joke
I can't be stopped, like nope, like nope!
Extend the beat, Noah..
Two seats in the 911, uh
No limit on the Black Card, uh
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM, uh
'Til ocean was my backyard, uh
No lies in my verses, hey
Please pardon all the curses, hey
Shit gotta come some way, fuck
When you're growing up worthless uh
Middle finger to my old life, uh
Special shoutout to my old head, uh
If it wasn't for your advice uh
A nigga would have been so dead uh
I'm living life til these niggas kill me
Turn this up if you niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, tryna get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MoMA
And I did all of this without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a muthafuckin fool if you wanna
Street-smart and I'm book smart
Coulda been a chemist cause I cook smart
Only thing that can stop me is me, hey
And I'mma stop when the hook start, hold up

'Til I die, I'mma fucking ball

Flashing lights, flashing lights

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call, like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know it was foul, baby
Aye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

As you recall you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far

Bloody murder, murder, murder

Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again

This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours

The paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
The paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again

Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us

"Black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs

Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress, in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough.. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go

Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours

Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
Cause they don't fucking

I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast motherfucker!

And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
So get your ass up off the wall

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

"... last call for alcohol, for my niggas"

Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth

So won't you raise your glass won't you

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

To DMX

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics"

I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."

I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

So won't you raise your glass, won't you...

Relivin' the past?
Your loss!

Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

We can send this bitch up, it can go down

This the cray-ist shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have

Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

Money never made me
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me
Even if the money low, can't pay me
Even if the money low, can't play me

Pablo bought a Rolie and a rottweiler
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
I've been outta my mind a long time
I be saying how I feel at the wrong time
Might not come when you want but I'm on time

I can't let these people play me
Name one genius that ain't crazy
Follow our father
You borrow our motto
I'm a Chicago south sider

Y'all sleeping on your boy, had a good snooze?
It's time to get the paper

I know, I know, I shouldn't even bother
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
PETA mad cause I made a jacket outta' possum
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urrr that they killed Pac in
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah
You know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!
You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!

This that rap god shit nigga

Whip out, bitch out
Tits out, oh shit

Fuck, can she fuck right now?

Lil Boosie with the wipe down
A little woozy but I'm nice now
What the fuck right now?
What the, what the fuck right now?
What if we fuck right now?
What if we fucked right in the middle
Of this mothafuckin' dinner table?
What if we fucked at this Vogue party?
Would we be the life of the whole party?
Shut down the whole party
Would everybody start fuckin'?
They don't want nothin'
You mothafuckas livin' like half of your level, half of your life
I smack her on her ass if she ghetto, I ain't gon' lie
We be in the bathroom fuckin' like, "Baby don't get too loud"
I can, I can see it, yeah

I want it right now
Ball on them niggas, get heated and shot down
You get hit with the pie now
Rolls with killa money nigga get by now
I'm with niggas that have been to Versailles now
Side now, slide down

Lifestyle on camera
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier
They tried to turn me to an animal
But white people think I'm radical
Supermodels think I'm handsome
You might think I'm too aggressive
But really I think I'm too passive
'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'

Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go

Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wouldn't none these niggas say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
And I'm fresh out of debt in this mothafucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

It's Gucci!
Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on
Now that Gucci home, it's over for you Gucci clones

Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top

Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through they secret identities
Lately it's all about Zen in me
Subtractin' the negative energy
Fuck with the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas keep it a century
I blow the check up, nigga, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Time my destination
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflectin' Satan
I'm a mothafuckin' champion
This right here the fuckin' anthem
I can't dap you without hand san'
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been
I wake up to like a hundred texts
Championship team, but we can't cut the net
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX
With...

'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

I took a nap in the pulpit
I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money
It got me walkin' all slew-foot
I'm on my wave like a cruise ship
In that hoe mouth like a toothpick
Anyone get in my way
Nothin' to say, I tote 'em choppas like pool sticks
I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris
Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks
I'm comin' from the apartments
We never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace logos on bowls in this bitch
Like I'm a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla
I did this shit for my niggas

I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain is suicide
The car I drive fit two inside
They mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood
But he let them goons inside
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Buy every house in this bitch
You know that the money good
My wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round
Play with the kid, I'ma gun you down
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found
Official trap shit let me slow it down
Way more shit than a Pamper
All we rock is bandanas
Whips so nasty, no manners
I just got head in a Phantom

She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp
And he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am
I love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram
Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown
And I don't really fuck around
I gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around

'Round and 'round it go

Uhh.. uhh
Good morning!

Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

Good morning, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

Every time that we hear them
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down

We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves

God show me the way because the Devil tryna break me down

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

*3 Minutes of Silence*

1985 white Lamborghini Countach, 2 of 'em

I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now, ay, ay

Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero Zero Zero Zero, a whole lot of O's
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money
Bullet proof condom, when I'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick, why? Fuckin' centerfolds
And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on feelin' like Jerome
She got her fur too, we got our his and her on
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your burrr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive

King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like

I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm building a still, down the time

I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night
Slow down the time
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night

You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms, still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms, still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

Who will survive in America?

Oh, oh, get down

Hey woah
Hey-hey

Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

Picture if you will that the throne's burning
Rome's burning and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead but I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So the love is gone 'til blood is drawn
So we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces before you swept on it
Goddamn this shit leaves a mess, don't it?
Shit feelin' like death, don't it?
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly pelican fly, turn the jets on it but first I shall digress on it
Didn't I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?

Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
And I'm bussin' back so niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turns to hate?
Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
P-p-p-paranoia

In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things, but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gonna keep hating me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gonna take off tonight into the night

It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon' do, Hov?
This a new crack, on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me "You back!"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you motherfucker, and I get it
No paper ho, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga
Going HAM nigga
Me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, that's why I have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head's so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below
A million out the door, I'm about to go HAM

Hard as a motherfucker
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM

Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I played chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been moved
I swam waters with Great Whites
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been chewed
I hustled with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
Then maybe you could take a peek at these boos
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady's money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
With my nephew die, daddy dead
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate, all on my garments
Comme des Garcons, fuck yo fresh
Headshots nigga, fuck your vest
Fuck the pigs, no pork on my fork
Peace God, cause you know a nigga just went HAM

Vivat rex in homine

Now, who with me? Vamonos! Call me Hov or Jefe

Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering

I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh

Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock?

I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate

Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
In God we trust, the game is all us
'til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push

2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul
I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
Aw man, made something from nothing)

I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothing

Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
I, go, go for mine, I gots to shine
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma
I'ma put shit down

Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

Yo, it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Welcome to the good life!
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Homey tell me what's good
Like I'm new in the hood
He probably think he could

Now I, I go for mine, I gots to shine

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me "baby"
If you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, 'cause this must be Heaven

Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify

Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touche, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high!
I'm, I'm sky high!
Sky, sky high! I'm, I'm sky high!
Yeah, keep it rollin'!
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!

Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because-

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up."
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Stadium status

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

Begin, Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, "New Jack City" got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'mma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Toomp killed this shit

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'mma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth

Get up, I get

Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter-chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do

Forrest Gump mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet

I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'mma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday

You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
Nowhere you go our love is true
Mama mama mama mama mama...

Wake up Mr. West - Mr. West - Mr. West...
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today

The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'mma be here 'til it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one
Tell them that I'm the one

I'm the one, baby, yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby, you on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt, you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps
Yeahhh, had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip - Yeeeaaaalmmp

I told Detroit I'mma fuckin' get it
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
Ye told me I'm the man for the job
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive
I'm on HBO with my entourage, I'm 5'9'' fuckin' 9 to 5
I need a hundred million no compromise, I'm a double X-L nigga
Magazine and condom size, see what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate, everyday
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud, I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day
I did it

Treat the back seat like a sofa bed
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit sharing
This some good shit, but it get better
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater
Like my verse suede and the beat leather
Just tryin' to stay above sea level
When my nigga went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags
I shouldn't have bought it all, I should've went and cut the grass
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag
Niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player

Fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace, it was really kind of awesome
It's possible, goddamn right
I've been honest the whole time

I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint
Make a nun cum, make her cremate
Move downtown, cop a sweet space
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes, huh
Well I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away"
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life

Lost and, beat up

Lost and, found now
Turned out, our new love
I do, love you
If your mama, knew how
Lost and found now

Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey

Knowin', you were drawn in
Amongst the yellow eyes

Me and the RZA connect
Yeah, me and the RZA connect

And I'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life, just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to LA
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure now we all pray

Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
Sins of a father make your life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach ya good values so you cherish it
Took me 26 years just to find my path
My only job is cut the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes so he know you talk truth
When you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
Have no fear that they might desert me

Diamonds are forever forever forever
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight

People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
You know the next question, dawg, "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back

Yup, I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Ha ha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear
Sayin' exactly what I've been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little something, show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say "when you see clothes, close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie,I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
Cause every summer, he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe

I think he did
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everything I wanted, man it seem so serious

When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one

Everybody want it, but it ain't that serious
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this... like this

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?

You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me. 

Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out  his hand and guide me through
Oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.

No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you
You are the joy of my life.

Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonce
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was as black as the street was
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the N-nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today

Talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan

Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Middle fingers up!

The whole world is a couch
Throw it up, throw it up cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world then I'm on my Sinatra
I'm doing it my way, let's take it a notch up
Take it up

Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doing things my way, it's my way or the highway

Mmm ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques
Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, "These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back"
I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
R. Kelly and the God of rap, shitting on you, holy crap

I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah, hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me

But it's too late, it's too late he's gone

You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way

Gone we striving home
Gone I ride on chrome, it's too late

Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like bitch it's yo turn
"Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

We striving home
I ride on chrome
Killa, I ride on chrome

Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

We striving home, I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me "Benz or Rover?"
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"

Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes?
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems, baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass?
You like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed
'Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
'Cause even when we're kissing, baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, "How is work, baby?"
Well, some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe, I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, "'Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends"
On the phone, hollin' that "Niggas is whatever"
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress"
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no, that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far"
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh

Hello, can I speak to, uh..
Yeah, you know who you are, look
You had no idea what ya dealing with
Something on some of this realest shit
Pop champagne, I'll give you a sip
Yeah that's my bitch, that's my bitch
Shorty right there? That's my bitch

I've been waiting for a long long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life and live my life

I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats, she learning a new word, it's yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors, ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak, huh, rock star life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at? In the middle

Swilling little licks and mixes 'til mornin'
I'm yearnin', ooh yeah
Could I maybe have another dab of your potion?
Stop motion, ooh, yeah

Go harder than a nigga for a nigga go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How can somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her
That's right nigga Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA
Half these broads ain't got nothing on Willona
Don't make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Penelope and Salma in it
Back to my Beyonces
You deserve three stacks, word to Andre
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums
You belong in vintage clothes crushing the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoo children, stop looking at her tits
Get ya own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break, next to the "no smokin'" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writing my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers
That's a Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!"
So many records in my basement
I'm just waiting on my spaceship

And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
Life my love, that's not mine
"Why you ain't signed?"
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Got to get mine
Got to take mine
Got a Tec-9
Reach my prime
Got to make these haters respect mine
In the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Staying low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you have to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people counting on me
And I'm just trying to find my peace
Should've finished school like my niece

I remember having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Trying to make this thing right
And having one of my co-workers say "Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me
A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me, brother, for a ride

Oh yeah, I've got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's...

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
"We don't care what people say"

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man
Man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake
And "we don't care what people say"

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But "we don't care what people say"
My niggas

Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus, oh sweet baby Jesus

I told my mama I was on the come up
She said, "You going to school, I'll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And I'm rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess I'm getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes, damn!
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin'
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain't no fashion show mothafucka, we live it

I pledge allegiance to my Grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don't wake Nana
Built a republic that still stands
I'm tryna lead a nation, to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up Yaya?
What's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star Spangled Banner

Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
And all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me)
Ma we here we gon' cook this Sunday ok?
That's a new girlfriend?

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, "This Can't Be Life"
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care 'bout
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
Now all I know I know all these things

And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV!"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit 3 in the bed if it's 6 of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business

They don't mean a thing a thing
They don't mean a thing a thing a thing
I don't care what they don't mean a thing
All I know, I know all these things
All these things, all these things

CLK Mercedes Benz
All these things, all these things ...
A whole lotta money
Mommy and Daddy, will you please stop fighting?
All these things, all these things...
Let's get Stevie outta jail

I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh

N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again

N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'Til I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke
But pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cuz we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture of her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T-E, it's getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to "call me"
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high

Yo, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
And sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or trying to get off cigarettes?
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it

Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger
Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor
I stole on liver, niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me
They say Hip-Hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come, you the hot garbage of
The year's clear your image and snooped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infra-red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper
Just an emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

In my soul
Gonna take you to the glory
Goal, in my mind I can't study war, yeah my
I can't study war, yeah my

Now where the South Side
I can't study no, yeah my
Now where the West Side

Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again?
Dog, are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
That's Louis Vuitton, bitch
I think Hennessy, I drink, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona. I'm zonin'
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And hey, please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, rock a chain 'steada wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy
I did it for the glory

Yeah my
The glory

What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends
Yeah, the dark skin'ed ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G
'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Yeah I'mma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory

I know you see me now right now
Right now, right now, right now

I got my suit and tie and I don't know if y'all know
Well, maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care, it's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

Yeah, uh, now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat in my boat shoes
Hah? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu wit' no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty, but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money, they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money, cops don't let a nigga pass Go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell em I said, "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said, "Hell no"
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
But I don't, no matter how good it gets, it'll never be like for...
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it's loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it's going down right now
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
'Cause I know she's lookin' down right now

Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder Ye
'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality

Now go get my throne cause I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone and I'ma make it hot 'til it's time to go
When it's time to go, where you trying to go?
You better act like you can see me now

Exactly, Rosewood
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D!

Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I loved her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
"Be successful," that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit
Comparin' them to us, man they gotta add Kobe
Whoadie, holy moley went, from G-Shockin' to Rollie

Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Uh, ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like? 'Ye protege
Nah, nah, he sound like he a pro to me
"I know Kanye a jerk," how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls

Rep Westside, throwin' up Ws
"We love you Sean," I love you too

Hahahahaha
Yeah, Lex Luger, No ID, Yeezy, uh

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lock-down-your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down-your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down-your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down-you lose

I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before

You lose

I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling, why I keep
All of these girls at my shows they loving me
But I don't know why I keep calling, why I keep calling you

All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?

I'm in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep, speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel to lower Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik
Get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single
Abbey Lee too, I'm a freak boo
I'm wilding, I'm on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I'm trying to eat out
So what we going to dinner for?

Miami nights on the search for some T and A
Trying to hide what's obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watching? Who the fuck wasn't?
Me skip across that stage in five dozen, EGGGHCK
Yeah, six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute rhyme
Let's be clear and let's be fair
The best things in music's being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near

But I don't know why I keep calling, why I keep calling you, hey

It's time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me

Uh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I'm puffing strong
I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone
Must've been the liquor talking, I'm begging the cups, c'mon
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler's poem
Nigga, make some money 'fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Prolly dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I'm back like a nine milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm
The world's mine, sits pretty in my palm
Chandon as we continue on

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fucking with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I'm off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, had Elsie the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don't really matter, we escape them with our paper
Hey ya, I'm on my Andre 3000
I'm all good now, a nigga don't need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when- let me not reflect on the old shit
I'm on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approaching
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Do things off-beat for a living, haters copy, I'm the image
Haters copy, I'm the image

You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car
So first of all we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies
We juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl
If you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends
OK, 3 more now hop in the Benz
4-door - do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

Hi, my name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to
Kanye's workout plan. I was able to pull a NBA player
And like now I shop every day on Rodeo Drive
I just want to say, thank you Kanye! Woooo! Woooo! Woooo!

My name is Lasandra, and I just want to say
That ever since listening to Kanye's workout tape
I was able to get my phone bill paid, I got sounds and 13's
Put up in my Cavalier and I was able to get a free trip to Cancun
And what's most importantly is that I ain't gotta fuck with Ray-Ray's
Broke ass no mo'

Juke it out
Pump it out
Shut 'em out
Let's go out

My name is Ella-May from Mobile, Alabama
And I just want to say since listening to Kanye's workout tape
I been able to date outside the family, I got a double wide
And I rode the plane, rode the plane, rode the plane

Thanks to Kanye's workout plan
I'm the envy of all my friends
See I pulled me a baller man
And I ain't gotta work at the mall again

I wanna see you work out
It's like that old Michael Jackson shit

That's right put in work, move your ass, go berserk
Eat your salad, no dessert
Get that man you deserve
It's Kanye's workout plan

That's right, put in work
Move your ass, go berserk

I want to see you work out for me
Woah, yeah

It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

And no matter what, you'll never take that from me

I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

Victorious, yeah we warriors
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon, summertime no June
Big family small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

So amazing, so amazing, so amazing

Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

Drive slow

What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby it's evident
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

Re-Up Gang Pusha
But you found it, motherfucker

All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil's angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn't cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The Audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse
Gone

I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modellin'
Take off that Givenchy and let's get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing, 'cause when you chase the pussy it's a sin
But if it falls in your lap, it's a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin'
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

Boy, we lookin' for trouble
Maybe if we wasn't black, then we wouldn't have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle
So I'm runnin' through them circles, boy, I'm looking like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in 'cause niggas was looking
I've tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I'm good for a scuffle
Don't be mad I whooped your ass, 'cause I've tooken a couple
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn't rebuttal
'Cause I'm Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn't play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain't nothin' silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I'm eatin' off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don't get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

G.O.O.D., I do it, B.I.G. Sean Don, nigga
But you found it motherfucker

I'm, in, that no-smoke sec rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you're not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don't need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G-stack's in my trousers
New Double D's smashed in her blouses
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I'm just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
'Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I'm snappin' like yo' ass just finished a poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake?
Meanwhile, I'm chillin' with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain't
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dyin'
Greet me wit' a middle finger when you see me
It's cool, 'cause I can't see yo' ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin' fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don't notice son
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in 'em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph's son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I'm better than Hov', but I'm the closest one
Heard you lookin' for trouble, what, I'm 'sposed to run?
Yo' bitch invited me inside her, ain't I supposed to come?
Got niggas that'll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven's gate, frontin' like you know someone
Talking hard, but y'all still ain't push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain't pussy
Fuck it, e'rybody can get it
When you're this hot, e'rybody's a critic
But when you're this high e'rybody's a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch
And you don't want no problems on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' 'bout
What you been praying fo'? What you been screamin' 'bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout

Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people

We living in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches; you know what time it is, watch us
They can't stop us, the prophets, biatches!

Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes we gonna stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you
Now you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, "Is this what it's all come to?"
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They're trying to Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this

I seen people abuse power, use power, misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it's a new hour
Now we all ain't gonna be American Idols
But you can least grab a camera, shoot a viral, huh
Take the power in your own hands
I'm a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don't stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I'm on my Van Gogh, I don't hear shit

Now everything I'm rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I'mma drop 'em in Islam
They say as-salamu alaykum say wa alaikum assalam
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we going stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, cause you know he drop bombs

Showtime
Hey, yo, Yeezy
Stop playing with these people, man
They want see you act all crazy in this motherfucker, man
Take that jacket off and go crazy on them niggas, man
You know what I'm talking about

What do it mean to be the boss
It mean second place is the first one who lost
The crucifixion, the being nailed to the cross
Truth or fiction, it's a hell of a cost, do the dishes
I'm about to hit that Jeff Gordon
Michael Jordan, the only one more important
But I be feeling like Jordan when I'm recording
'Cause every time I record, I dunk and slap the boards
I don't know what these rappers gonna do afterwards
Prolly spaz like I might do at the awards
Huh, I got the whole crowd going crazy
Homie, I should be rewarded
Gettin' money, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh
Eating Wheaties, drinkin' Fiji, being greedy, huh
Don't even think you can allude to the rumors
I'm immune to the boos, I'ma prove to you losers
It's all in time, my nigga
See, I dreamed my whole life that I could rhyme with Jigga
Now Jay my big brother and B my lil sister
And excuse me, but you can't see my lil sister
Number one sound across the board, hey
Number one now and forevermore, hey
Number one rule is niggas don't hate
Maybe I'll drop the album, nah, all y'all gotta wait
And on the net, they showing pictures of my Cali place
My Maybach in NY, but it still got the Cali plates
All my old girls know that I'm the one that got away
I think about at Christmas and play some Donny Hathaway
And keep my bulletproof hater coat on
Looking at some photos that I'm looking crazy dope on
Hand up, talking shit, yeah, I get my Pope on
And go home with something to poke on
That's what Dre said, but this what Ye said
How Ye doing? Who Ye screwin?
That's for my dick to know, before you get to know him
She ain't give you ass, that pussy fictional
I gotta give her the eviction note
'Tis, get yo' ass out, bitch, vamonos
Five seconds to the song and we getting close
I got the power, motherfucker, if you didn't know

Chill, chill, chill, chill, man
Chill, Ye, chill
Shit's burned up already
It's over

Yeezy, Yeezy, what's good?
It's your boy Max B, what's going on?
Just checking in on you
Appreciate the love and support
The wave is here
You a wavey dude anyway, so you already know
Ain't no problem, man, the game...
You already know how this game thing goes
Do your wave nigga
You got the official wave man
Just, just doing you...
Doing you, doing your wave
And keep it loopy, I know you're going to keep it loopy man
Shoutout, just shout you out
Hollering at you man, it's all love
I appreciate the... the energy
And we here, hit the town, we do something big
We gonna make a big tsunami up in the joint
You already know what it is, ahh

Silver Surfer
Silver Surfer in the flesh

Silver surfer in the flesh
Max Bigavelli shout to Yeezy
What's good, I see you
It's love, appreciate it
It's honor, appreciate it
Ugh, wavey, baby, yeah

Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25
She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"

Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears
Work pots and pans, just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died, my daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard

Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que sera, get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain, before it goes too far

My dreams is big, reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin'
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public, just lying to judges
Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well

Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well, goddammit

Why would she make calls out the blue?

Don't say you will, unless you will
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Don't say you will, you do
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

Don't say you will, you will you will
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

Don't say you will, you will, you will
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will

Add a little sugar, honeysuckle and
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are all the makings of you

I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now there's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C. just had a shorty, so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

No electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto
You know the demo, your boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy's back in style
Now in one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Naw, you ain't listen, they black, they sistas
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessey, a bad bitch
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed? Well, mine's an obscenity

This is my mama's shit; I used to hear this
Through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pajama shit
Afros and marijuana sticks, seeds in the ganja
Had it poppin' like the sample that I'm rhymin' with
Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop
Takin' sips of Pop's six-pack of Miller nips
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale
Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my mama's
Virgin Marys try to judge her
I'm like "Where them Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria
They said, "You raised that boy too fast"
But you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh

Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up yeah
Yeah, okay

I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still

I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
Can't wait for the clouds to break

They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses

I, smile, when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away

Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no

The rings all ring out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out

My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh

And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it

Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

I've seen it, I've seen it before

My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak

And I and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it

School spirit, motherfucker

Alpha, step
Omega, step
Kappa, step
Sigma, step
Gangstas walk
Pimps gon' talk
Ooh, hecky nah, that boy is raw
AKA, step
Delta, step
S.G. Rho, step
Zeta, step

I'mma get on this TV, mama
I'mma, I'mma put shit down
I'mma make sure these light-skinned niggas
Never, ever, never come back in style
Told 'em I finished school and I started my own business
They say "Oh you graduated?" No, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want, I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This nigga graduated at the top of our class
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there

I got a Jones like Norah for your soror
Bring more of them girls I've seen in The Aurora
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or a Shirley
I'm trying to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry
Roc-a-fella chain, yeah that's my rapper style
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style
And I ain't even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason

I feel a woo coming on, cuz
There it was
I feel some woos coming on, cuz
A couple woos coming on, cuz
WOO, WOO
There they was

You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local c'mon homie we major

We major? C'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon

Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

We major! C'mon homie we major

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never; it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

But better late than never; it's orientation

We major

Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me - why you call it Late Registration 'Ye?
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
"All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could

What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola
Then I'm co coming over cause it's never over

I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca Cola
And I keep co coming over cause it's never over

I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be
I just let it be
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
You know I was just kidding

We in the time of our lives, baby
Turn the music up, primetime

Yeah, primetime, beat by Dion
Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on
Mo' money, 40-year old phenom
Our 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42, be better than 24s
I carry the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23's, they can't fuck with the boy
As far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 911, I only subtract the roof
Started in '88, got warm in '92
I landed in '96, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for CIROC to give Puff's stocks a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontainebleau
A case of Ace...make it 2
Nigga we rollin', beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do

The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh?
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn, Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well Adam gave up a rib, so mine better be prime
Niggas gon' kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first first-class flight
I'm tripping on it, socks on marble floors, I'm slipping on it
Champagne I'm sipping on, shit tastes different, don't it?
You know what? You right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home?" That's a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker 'til I call you back
I mean, who says shit like that and doesn't laugh?
Hah...

Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me...

Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be

In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too

Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds

We outta here baby!

Dude! Fresh off the plane, Konnichiwa, bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head?
'Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me

Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby!
Wha, wha, we outta here baby!
Hey Mr. West we so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby, yeah

I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Meagan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them," I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant "havoc"
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so avid, no homo
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat, bitch

Ha-Ha-Hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, "Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch"
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's

I love you, hate you at the very same time

And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be"
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

I don't want you
...very same time)

Kanye, it's Foxx, man
I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
She gotta drink water cause she thirsty
She danced like ninety-two hundred songs back to back
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
Like how she feel... you know what she told me?

She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right

It definitely will
You know what I told her
I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin' me, callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin' though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For The World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right

Smokey Robinson
Freddie Jackson
Set the party, really set the party off right
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be)
Al Green, OH!
Al Green, OHHHHH YEAH!!!

Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?

Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please - do it faster, baby, do it faster

Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy - play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stoplight, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B - and I got the heat - on the 23's
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I love the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit me

Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give or take" world I got what it takes
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

You know what I need
Want you to see everything

Ready, set, go
Go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency

So good, so good, Westside, so hood
I do it.. B. I.... G

Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding
Weezy with me, I just stepped out of the strip club
Made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one
So call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, so y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that
All in the Sprite, all in the Sprite

On lonely nights, I start to fade
Her love's a thousand miles away

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?

It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see

Memories made in the coldest winter, winter, winter

If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all of our mistakes

Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again

All engines running

We gonna take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged, we about to take this whole thing to Mars

Please don't fall asleep, baby, we almost back
Please don't throw up in the car, we almost crashed
Oh, now you sober, how'd I know you'd say that

Love the dangerous necessity that people seek
Without regard to where they are
The human heart is curious
Above all things, love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
Your dress is tight
Oh howwwwww, I want you right now

'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the top's
The only place to go now

Oh, everybody, fuck that

Two words, free way, two letters, AR
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car, my God
Two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
To brawl, forget ya squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words, "send for the law", uh
Two words, Freeway slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad

Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin' "who is that?"
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest

Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love

It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I sacrifice, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
Do you think I sacrifice, a real life
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell
And my mind, out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life

I just wanna be a real boy
They always say "Kanye, he keeps it real boy"
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

It's funny
Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin, say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!?

Pinocchio's story goes, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes

And there is no Gepetto, to guide me
No one, right beside me
The only one, was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't follow no more
I can't..
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death
Thinkin' the money that the-
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left, for a real boy!
They say "Kanye, you keep it too real boy"
Perspective, and wise man say
One day, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way

What in the fuck was that Kanye?!
I told you to do some shit for the kids!
You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now!
You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis!
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage!
A muthafucka can't pull you across that stage Kanye!
Who told you see, I told you to do somethin' uplifting!
I'm tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me!
You know what, you's a nigga!
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
You throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
Cause you gettin' the fuck out of this campus
What the fuck you gone do now

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me but don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes I'm just not everybody

'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Now I don't need no Robocop

Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on

Stop ... drop ... roll ... pop
Bitch I'm cold ... I
Ain't used to being told ... stop
So I could never be your robot
Fast or slow, you can stay or can go
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know
Yeah I had her before but that happened before
You get mad when you know, so just don't ask me no more
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh
It ain't ok, ok, ok

You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Haha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
Oh you need to stop it now

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
But is it cool to rap about gold
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $free.99
Later on I might charge for menage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh
She asked "Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the four dot six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And I'mma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

"And you say Chi city?" scratched repeatedly

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

From the place where the father's gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the Madigan's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music

Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin somethin on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin up this here crack music

Please stop your crying

I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like

Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom
Yeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh
Stop your cryin', baby

You know when you be late you miss all the lights
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?
"I'll be there in five minutes," go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah

I hear you, I hear you, L-Boogie
Remember they used to call you that?
What you say, Lauryn?
You just keep singing, I'mma tell 'em

I'm telling you all when it all falls down

Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down

Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this!"
It seems we living the American Dream
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop

I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, "Where the ballers at?"
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it

Don't stop that shit, keep that shit
Keep that part where I ran out of breath
We ain't doing no punch-ins, man
That's that fake shit
If I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?
It's from the heart anyway
Might cause shortness of breath, ya know?
Couldn't have got nobody better for the job
Thank you very much this a beautiful
Beautiful young lady that's inspired me definitely

I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door, door, door, door, door
After tonight there will be no return
After tonight I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know

That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you cause I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

Tell everybody, everybody that you know

But this is farewell, yeah

Baby girl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it
And now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stank
But you are Mrs. Pee-Yew
And I don't see you
With me no more
Now tell everybody that you know

And that's one thing that you know

Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules
Cause I just heard some real bad news

People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you how long have you known dude
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide, to break the rules

Real bad news
Oh, you just gon' keep another no you won't
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
Oh, you just gon' keep another love for you
While I'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true
What's on the news?
Channel cruise

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo Da Vinci
What good is fame and prestige if you can't use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do bestcreate
I have started a new company and I'm so excited about the nameit's got the best name everof all companiesof all time!!!
The name of the company is DONDA
The Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be
I'm currently working on a new 7 screen experience

We can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off
Some kids have better memories than otherswhat about emotional IQ's? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?
Excuse meI just get excited at the possibilitiesthe more excited I get the more grammatical errors you'll see
We need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better
When me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us
I just wanted to share what's been on my mind

And now for my next number I'd like to return to the

Uh yeah, is y'all ready for 20-07? It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, wow, we buggin' out
Since '86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of "classic" is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call 'em uppies when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus

You can't buy this Superfly-ness, like a shine is
Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
'Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been

Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well

Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh, you went platinum? Yeah, that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firin' in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah

"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One"

How many of y'all got Criminal Minded?
You, you, you; y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why? I don't need 'em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at? C'mon, where you at?
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo ingles"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

What you calling?
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

Uh, GOOD Music, this our year
Backing drums by DJ Premier
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here
Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh
That niggas know you can't really fuck with that
Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic
Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everyone fasting
Big Sean is a don
Cyhi Da Prynce
Why you so nervous dog stop being tense
If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common
Fuck that and thats just common sense

Came in the game, 8 years prior
8 years later, your mans on fire
My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers
Play the two doors, street car named desire
Came in Grindin', Ye' came Through the Wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers
Red Toupee on the coupe you've been fired
Smooth criminal, no prior's
Man in the mirror, check no liar
Still let that "butter fly" like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry MaGuire
Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right
West Hollywood feels like a bunny night
With GOOD company and better jewelers
To the Good Life, we GOOD music

Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings
I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life's prom night and guess who's the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring
I'm Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter
Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky's the limit is looking dumb
Cause I'm 22 and I'm moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my "whoa there!", right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her
And im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips 'cause it's Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch
And now I'm here
That should let you know what I'm about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team's killing
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin
Many tell me I'm the man I ain't made it yet
Tell me who the baddest, I'll see if I seen them naked yet
Won't stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

I'm Mr Got bread like Quizno's
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn't see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
And being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I'm big poppa plus I'm 2pacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for
Huh, I'm doing this for hip hop
Im coming after you, him and his spot
Still tied to the streets like a hitch knot
Ain't nothing fake, I'm not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the Yankee
Rose wood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I'm flexible stretching out my decimel's
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can't bleep it out cuz there wasn't nothing sexual
I'm blowing loud, somebody check the decibels
I'm impeccable they put me on the pedestal
And if you bite me, it's good for you like a vegatable
Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals
And if I ever do time than you know its federal
Uh, incredible, yeah

F-f-fam fam fam I'ma monster too
You don't see I do things that the monsters do
The incomparable, remarkable, articles
About my audio technique, my technique
I recognise games like the ESPY's
Cold to myself I say God Bless me the truth
So I speak live and directly
You, I will set free my mic is where my check be
Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro
Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough
The name is Common but the frame is special
Leave requested from the years I've invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

The plan was to drink till the pain over
What's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake shit, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed

Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin' the good life
Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
And we wipin' snow up off the windshield
It's still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I'm, so happy I'm with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
My only question is, "Where my presents?"
She said, "Shhh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said "It's Dee-ricious"

Merry X-mas, Santa Claus cherry X6
They ain't hear my rain, dear
Make it snow on the next chick
Got enough toys, wondering what's my next pick
Before my exit, it get diamond rolex reckless
Big bags, Got everything on the checklist
Necklace, Baguette wrist
Pockets fat, they Precious
Give Ma a peck kiss, look and tell her she precious
Lighting up the sour, this tree give me the best gifts

And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus
No reindeers, just horses and a Panamera Porsche
We on two fifth shopping, what the damage cost
I got your fam while you bidding in the can up north
Woops, I'm at Niemens I hope they still got em
You want the thigh high spikes with the red bottoms
Let's make a toast cause Christ is born
We gon' party all night til the lights come on

Yeah, mom and dad I won't be home for the holidays
I'm over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York I'm still repping for the A
Cyhi!

On the stoop of that Brownstone shovelling the brownstone
Santa's on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Down town got me feeling like it's Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like its down home
Snow like sugar hill
Chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

Oh, pose for them photo stills
You dont wanna miss a moment
Where's your NoDoz pills
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel
Hope you know those real
Okay my white girl Veronica
Black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rocking dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up!

Lenox Ave to Saint Nick
Never seen St Nick
Just niggas selling the same nicks, the same bricks
Same hustlers running up the broadway
Thats where the snow's at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo's
Christmas lights in project windows
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah

All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit' your family's where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let's have Christmas in the hoo-hood

All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
'Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus

While you're fast asleep

I feel like this
I feel like that
I feel like this all the time
I feel like that all the time

You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
'Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not for nothing
I know you're looking for something
And I've got it
Why you fallin' on me
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Oh, you nnannanaa
I know you must be tired
From running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Also, I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome
Y'all know
And I'd rather do nothing with you
You're so out the park, you're so after time
You're so breaking ?, oh it feels so right

Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real MC
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me

Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

Such an easy morning, we on a ride
And I'm feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They don't want black people to think and drive

He think he live, he think he cold
He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode
Eyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across

I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it's Fashion Week
And the weather wasn't barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music and forever we hot?
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?

This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop
This goes out to the all core hip-hop

As Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He's heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
Selling kilos through your iPod Nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury's handle
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, something like Breyer's
Euro tank top, Dior-inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
Yuugh, in 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with the 20 in
While haters wish death upon me, that's many men
Yeah, and if he slam you on your paper route
Stop talking, motherfucker, pull your paper out

Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right
Don't worry, we gon' be here all night
So t-t-tell me who the freshest of them all?
They claiming that they fresh, they ain't fresher than my balls
A nigga suited fresh like I'm headed to the ball
MC hunting season, putting heads up on the wall
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from A's to B's to C's
All over double D's, I be absent all week
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for
Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door
Hold on, that's the girl you gave a wedding ring?
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything

And let me hear you say ahh, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

Now put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
And we'll be here all evening
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend

I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'mma just say good night

Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
We can't dwell on the past, all we got is today
So I'mma live like it's no tomorrow, no goodbyes

Uh, to you
If I part, my art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you

Provide a new coffin
You don't seek murder like this this often

God level

Our father

Might as well make a new casket

You see sharks in the water
Then they try to do nothin' but put cocks in your daughter
Don't say nothin' 'bout what Ye said
Don't move, mothafucka, play dead
Yeah, we cool, mothafucka, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

Why you actin' all
Shy and all
Why is y'all
Lyin' for?
"I never did this before..."
Stop that
What, you want some Patron?
I got that
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon' give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off

But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it floooooow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it bloooooow

See you know my style
I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was praticing
'Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child 'cause now y'all

AUUURHHHHEE
EEUUUAAHHH
WOOIASHHHHH
WAAHHHHHHH
LAHSHSHHHHH
NAAAGHHH

They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale - Horse"
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it -

"Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again"

The power of observation
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiyamah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large many more
To make our largest star show small
Furthermore, the end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them?
Sweet Jesus and life on Earth
Seek heaven first
Let's put in this work

Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias?
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings, and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts. I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies, booby trapped
Holla back

All white Bentley, I call that mama
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick? Well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, I'm what's happening I get it cracking
All black Carbon on my wrist yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP, well they thank me
And I be mad too if you ain't me
Call me Mr. Dean or Mr. Bars
See me riding clean in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny, that's old money
Niggas looking crazy but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me, I'm a bank hogger
Coming through your hood in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck
100 feet and better, what the fuck use stick
Paparazzi on the water what the fuck use stick
My face got the "fuck you pricks"
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede, nigga, in the damn rain
Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos we do the god damn thing

Ay yo open glass on my fingers
I sit back like I'm caged but still caking
My niggas is hating
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger
Stones they throw that's why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine
Nonbelievers no game
I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction
I'm sun he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas
Out cruising in a Volvo, a duffle for dolo, buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends, counting currency, hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble, grab the 4
Hope it ain't the law
Or maybe some nigga trying to score

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring?
It's feeling like Hell rings
I'm spaced out Dogg, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
I'm spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Let's exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious, gettin' anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say I've been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I'll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off
I'm paranoid; like bonin' raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea, that'll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

Nothing bout you
I wanna tell you
Dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy

How many *mumbles* do you got on call? All day, nigga
Swish, swish, *mumbles* they keep you in court? All day, nigga
South, south side! All day, nigga

Talkin' big face, nigga
Put yo' ass back of pocket like a switch blade, nigga, uh
I ain't tryna play, nigga
'Ye in the building like a hallway, nigga
*pause*
Still got the hundred with the small face, nigga
Might *mumbles* naturally all day, nigga
If *mumbles* have Allstate with you, uh
Ride 'round something and it's all day, nigga
Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga
*mumbles*
*mumbles* then booked it like the Barclays Center, uh

All day hoe, my neck look sweeter than parfait hoe
Rap Derek Jeter in a red two-seater
Ask me how long do it take to be the greatest
24/7 365 days everybody gettin' paid
Nigga lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJ's
Chitown, PJ all of BJ
Chitown, we play for the freebase
These days, don't believe what police say
DJ's and the B-boys run shit

So won't you dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy

*guitar plays with whistling*
Until I find myself
In the morning sun
Give me space
I want to find myself
In that special place

One glad morning
When this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land where
Joy shall never end

Oh I'll fly away oh glory
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye

Uh, we got the black elite in the house tonight
Rosewood
I feel like I'm at the NAACP or something right now
Essence Festival
Q-Tip on the beat, too

My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause it's flooded
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the fronting?
Why y'all got all caps on?
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em
Burn, Hollywood, burn!
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear life's a bitch, on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I don't give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks

Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800s
Y'all forget that I got called "nigga"
On Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Don't give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away, huh? Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master "Peace!"

Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the things cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me nobody scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye them load of whores by the boards
Trust

That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
"You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
Cause you be running around like the chain make the man"
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
Cause my chain commands that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
"Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy"

Now beat that!
And your mother's saying "Go to college"
So you finish college and it's wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and craziness
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey!
Now you'll get that 25-thousand dollar job a year
And you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine
But, it'll be YOUR money
No more borrowing from mom for my high!
So now you get your degree tattooed on your back
Cause you're so excited about it
If you continue to work at the Gap, after several interviews, oh my God
You'll come in at a entry-level position
And when you do that
If you kiss enough ass
You'll move up to the next level
Which is being the secretary's secretary
And boy is that great
You can take messages for the secretary
Who NEVER went to college
She's actually the boss's niece!
So now you're part of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart, man
All you kids wanted to talk in the back of the class
Not me, I listened
Okay?
I was a hall monitor
This was meant to be
You know how many classes I took?
Extra classes, extra classes
No, I've never had sex
But you know what?
My degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks up to me and says
"Hey, you know what's sexy?"
No, I don't know what it is
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse
Very fast

No man you don't have the answers

You dont have to turn up
This ain't no fucking show

Ain't no homie

Ain't no ain't no hold up
Ain't no hold
I can make shit rhyme
I can make shit rhyme if I'm
Feel like, even if I, don't
So I just, might not, cause I
Don't want, and I'm just gon'
Freestyle, for the first time
With a, freestyle, that don't, even go together, oh
No rhymes, that's my new shit, nothing rhyme
How that sound, uh oh, woh
You ain't got the answers, Sway
I can say it all, night

Oh, ho-ho-ho!
I knew I was gon' see, I knew I was gon' see you again! Knew I was gon' see you again!
Where your goddamn book bag at?
Always carryin' that lil' book bag, nobody wants to see that!
Goddamn 4th grader, sit your ass down!
He wanna play it again like he got somethin' else to do
You ain't got somethin' else to do!
You ain't doin' nothin' wit' your life, notin' wit' your life!
You think this is?
You better look at me when I'm talkin' to you!
You think this shit easy, don't you?
You think this is promised!
Well ain't nothin' promised to you!
Look at my face, do I got a promised face?
Does it look like I promised you anything?
Kanye, nigga-is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West!

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Spread your wings, aerial

Head to the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him "trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her you wouldn't leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So lets hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like the end, question mark

Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You would've been the best mom, I would have been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross but we getting very close
To our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

How could you do it, how could you do it
Okay now baby here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean "me go", why can't it be "we go"?
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat
How could my girl do this to me
Woke up to a note saying "the world did this to me"
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But its not even half the feeling as hearing your "Seans, you know I love you"
Shedding tears everyday, and I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask why sometimes, like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees everyday, like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the phoenix sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out
So I could see you smile
I know you can see me now

Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what though, I'ma take this one for the team

Imma take this one for the team, G.O.O.D. Music
You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people's kids
I hate plastic couches in other people's cribs
I hate when other people's cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said "I just cleaned up"
Baby I can't tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell?
Or that God damn cucumber Bath and Body Works?
I can still smell the sweat, the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
Oooh, that shit gotta hurt

Never mind me, 'Ye have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'm a take, I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's Jeans on a jackass?
And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga, and I carry on
With them bottles of that Rose and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carries on?
Dookie rope link chain and a herringbone
The real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights baby that's a field trip
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch

Boy I know you the one that I heard about
I know you working with it through word of mouth
Looks like I'm a have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta
Take it for the team

I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar
Playing with her kitty made her come in the car
She a redbone but her cousin is dark
A little out of shape but she'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complaining about her feet hurt
I'm trying to fuck she talking about she want to eat first
I'm like "why did this bitch have to bring her?"
Trying to get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
Said, "I got a chick for you that look like a singer"
On a scale of one to ten she's a fifteener
You should've seen a nigga's face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team she would be a fifth stringer
I said I got the fine one in the Beamer
I'm the point guard and I need a winger
Take one for the team

It's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out
She can't clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet I'm going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted, goddamn, who brought the raccoon out?
For the team

I go for, I got to
Go for, I got to
South side, we gonna set this party off right
This time

You keep it going man
You keep those books rolling
You pick up all those books that you're gonna read and not remember
And you roll, man
You get that associate's degree, okay?
Then you get your bachelor's
Then you get your masters
Then you get your masters' masters
Then you get your doctorate
You go man!
And then when everyone says quit
You show them those degrees, man
When everyone says "Hey, you're not working, you're not making any money"
You say "You look at my degrees, and you look at my life
Yeah, I'm 52! So what?
Hate all you want, but I'm smart, I'm so smart
And I'm in school
All these guys out here making money all these ways
And I'm spending mine to be smart!
You know why?
Cause when I die buddy
You know what's gonna keep me warm?
That's right, those degrees."

La La La La
Wait till I get my money right

Duct tape when we wrap them, call me prejudice
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news
Fresh nine piece, yeah them wings is cajun
Well, fuck it I'm rich then
If balling is a crime, fuck it I'm hit then
If thugging is a term, fuck it I'm it then
The insane dough, hey, fuck it I'm sick then
Somebody call me a shrink
Top down in the Bent, I'm so intoxicated
Sometimes I think to myself "Goddamn, I made it"
And I know they hate it
On the all night flight
Trying to get my money right
Wassup?

Excuse me, is you saying something?

Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Leer Jet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right she gon come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn 'Ye, would you change anything?
I'd copped more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
"Wait 'til I get my money" everybody's motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything I wrote
Yeah, hey, mama they can't hate him
'Cause after all of the drama, K slayed them

Why were you late?
Yeah! You know I'm serious, nigga! I got money!)

Oh oh oh oh oh
Good money made!

We broke, broke broke phi broke
Broke, broke, broke phi broke
Don't spend no money
Ain't got no clothes
Ain't got no cars
Ain't got no hoes
We broke, broke, broke phi broke
Can't get no hoes
We broke, broke, broke, broke, broke
Buncha niggas
Broke, broke, broke, broke, broke!

Bom bom bom bom bom

Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me no curl
Cuz somebody cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you Mama

Mama, you know I love you so, and I'll never let you go
And I wrote this song just so you know that when you go

And this life is all a dream
And my real life starts when I go to sleep

I never liked you niggas
Who knew one day I'd be just like you niggas
Uh, alright you niggas, uh, alright you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why? He at least Hooper-Size
You know I scrutinize, like, "Who this newer guy?"
I'm my mama boyfriend, I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasn't
Tryna get to know me, homie? Just kill the charm
You ain't interested in me, you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents' bad choices
The aftermath of divorces, the kids of bitter split-ups
And babysitters, grandparents that don't know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing, short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing, church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance?
When you get here anyway? I already got parents
Don't try to put me in line, I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it, I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her that'd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out, "I ain't going to sleep no time soon!
And when I do, I'm sleeping in my mama's room!"

I don't like you nigga
If I was old enough I'd fight you nigga
I want to run over you with my bike, you nigga
Don't go to sleep at night, you nigga

Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see I'm dating, having problems of my own
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around
I never thought I'd ever raise another nigga's child
He don't like his mama's boyfriend just like me
Don't wanna do the wrong thing, that's very un-Spike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama, there
Cause when she here, he be quiet when she leave, he be talking again
He be wilding out, be calm
I don't drink the drama or sip the Dom-Tyler-Perry-on
"You gonna marry my mom?" Look, I don't read palms
And I don't read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look, little man, kids don't make the rules
Even though I ain't raised you, you your mama's angel
Don't get it twisted, baby boy, I'll Ving Rhames you

Man, I can understand how it might be

Good God!
Midwest coast back, nigga
And don't say 'nigga' unless of course you black, nigga
Free country, they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all their white daughters drinkin' Hennessy
I'mma go to Sal's with some niggas on the wall
I might go to Oz, take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano's so involved
I know, King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had two Polos
We the kids they'll keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They ask about the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff
You know

Children of Jih
Children of Jih, put your hands up

I, you don't need, need to ever write
I read your last message at least a thousand times
At least a thousand, least a thousand times
Why would you ever listen to people tryna hate on you
At least you know there's nothing new

I hope you're ready for tonight
I'm gon' cook, you'll be dessert
I gotta move, I gotta dance
I gotta hope, I got a chance

Baby, not for nothing, I know you're lookin' for somethin'
And I got it, why you frontin' on me?

You're so freakin' tight
Of running through my mind
Cause baby I'm awesome, also
I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome, y'all know

I brought you brothers here today to start our own fraternity
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it
No, we have no money
We are sharin' jeans
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car?
Yes, we will
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!
Say it!
So we ain't drivin'!

Why are you so angry? What's the anger?

How the fuck did Eminem get the Best Hip-Hop song in 2008?

There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasn't bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and would get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in 92', I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel

We ball 'til we fall
Hit the mall
After we
Hit don't call
We fill your lives
With nothing but lies
And I would like to
Apologize

But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop... hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty g's to fifteen hundred in a week
No I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
Cause until that real man stands up

*Key*

Hey Jimmy, where you going?
I don't know where I'm goin'
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?"
But he just kept learning
All the other kids' parents were working and saving up money for school
And I was actually in school all while my dad was in school!
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree
And now I'm just glad he left me these
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have
These are documented
My father left them for me
And I'm going to leave them to my kids
I'm going to learn too
I'm going to get super smart, so I, too, can die without money
But I'll be the smartest dead guy!
Who has that?

And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again

They want me to hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on...holding hands in vein
Couple of the feds say I'm insane
A psych said.....
And then his son told me put down the drink dawg
I got a...
I guess... finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks
....
....modest
And every good god needs a goddess
And every good star couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I.... with my riders
...Riders

I don't like them, they don't like that
They don't like that, I don't want that
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me, worry about you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hating motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again

See I need some time to meditate
Naw bitch I'm fly I need time to levitate
And I don't sound....trying to hesitate
....like nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight and I'm very great
I put in every date, rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
I must...
Guess its my fate, guess it was written
I can... guess it was different
...back then I was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound like
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic
I don't need...
Feel like...
And these niggas are secondary like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light
I'mma be down, right, when you niggas is downright biters
And my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer

Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them, don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you and baby I do
Don't worry bout something else we can't do
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you, and worry 'bout something else we can't do...
Don't worry 'bout me, and it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Again, again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

Can you clap your hands, hands
Clap your, clap your hands, hands
And I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do again

So the song like a Section 8
So I pass that dick around like the collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday ...with the...
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make
So if everybody is sad now, and shit don't pan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
....this song is like Jerome is
....on the cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
When you wait another two shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm "that nigga"
Or maybe I'm...
Or maybe damn, I could...my shit...
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should...I could reconsider
And I'mma drink until I can't stand and got no liver
I can stand and deliver 'til the...
And I'mma spit it, like it get it, gonna die by the...
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self 'til my very last breath
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud...
And I could style on...to hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga I'm...
I'm liable to be a liability...
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability, and my ability
I can sound like...

Worry about something, something will do
And motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up for some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time before
You ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'fore you ever see me

Don't worry about what I been up to
When the fuck I'm going hard, nigga fuck you
Who the fuck is going, I can...
Who the fucks asking? I'll put the summer on blast and
Who the fucks lasting?
And be the last standing
Caught up on the...
Get a better tan and
I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
In afternoon I annex
And all of the damage...
Left on the...
Who...after all, I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the sun, cus I have to ball
I run the world cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' 'fore I got it all
And you feeling like you got it all?
Nah nigga, not at all

Don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And what'chya gon' do?
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again

... on the all out, ...all out
Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense...what y'all 'bout?
Bumping... and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, you don't fuck around
Put everything on the...then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something, now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something, ya'll don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, went to see a specialist
I was under...and learning what the lesson is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something...
...and you had to look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in is there any point of any of this?
....put hands on you, then put his front side and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really? I'm done motherfucker
I got enough to...

Worry bout me, just worry bout you, I can... when I be good
And she said now
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I been up to
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
Me again, me again, and it'll be a long time before you ever see me again

Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey?

Lost in my doubt

When she met Joseph around hella thugs?
"What if Mary was in the club

They gossiping, it runs the city
They don't know who watching them when they coming to get me
So I hit the block and bend, do about sixty
And I put my Glocks to them, like blaow, blaow, blaow

I'm finna get on this TV and put shit down
I ain't finna let these light skinned niggas come back in style
I'm finna turn this class clown shit to crazy G's
They told my Momma I was bipolar, had A.D.D
I told 'em w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hating on you to their mans on the corners
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the ten-karat gold
That get green on you, when you get green on 'em
You gotta wash your hands of 'em, get clean on 'em
Somebody told me success is the best revenge
So they gon' be fucked up when you do your thing on 'em
Now hold your plaques high, like who would've thought?
And tell em *ahem ahem ahem*, thank you for your no support

They are the dream killers, they the dream killers
They the dream killers, they the dream killers

Now how you going to talk about the way I spend my money?
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hating, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
'Cause we the leaders and they the followers
And we the nut busters and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit, dog, and they the flies
How you gonna tell me how to live my life?
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right?
They are the misery that loves company
'Cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told 'em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said, "Oh you graduated?" Nah, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you got planned
And they hate on your relationship then break your marriage up
Can't kill your dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay you or embarrass you
Come around with you but they ain't down with you
They the dream killers

And I'm through spitting these rappers my most heartfelt flow
'Cause they be like, "That's cool, you got some beats for me though?"
Oh, I get it, you want to be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say
Anyway, what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out your house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put your fist to your spouse, so how you gon' move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out
I even heard that they even taking wagers in jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon' be like, "Peace?"
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the East
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York? What, you ain't never took a tour there?
What, you ain't know you gotta be rich just to be poor there?
The dream killers

I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique
Any street

Father is the black Bruce Wayne
Only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains

If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress

Somebody told me Delta's brown-skinned, AKA's light-skinned
And they supposed to be bougie, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
Last year a nigga hit her, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightenin', but

The night fallin' over Brooklyn where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth like I'm comin' out the mouths of babes
One foot in and one foot out the grave
Niggas want they reparations, how you calculate the amount to be paid?

Her tenament, yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bullion because she went and protested
'Cause her best friend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a Glock
In the hood is an everyday happenin'
In front of the precinct, she chews out the captain
She yells out, "Why y'all do this to black men?" C'mon

I think of eighty-seven ways to make better days
Whether crime or rhyme, I heard the rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
The music, ridin' it good like Escalades
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Lil Wayne in The Carter's that-

C'mon, look
Tell people the truth, but never give 'em your true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Patriot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnnie Cochran dead, who gonna get us "Us free" now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs in the penal?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, dawg, I see now

Yeezy, Ne-Yo, the remix ayo
I think it's time to hit 'em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny, and I know it's especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon' question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy, I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so 80's
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the 26 inch rim wheels looks so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly shit that you be on
Gucci on, aligned by Louis Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
Cause, you in my soul and system
And we gon' take her home with this one
I got something that you gon' like
You got something that I can't fight
We got something that we both gon' like

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true

Over you, over you, over you
Because of you
She's the sweetest drug, she's the sweetest drug

Highlights
Tell my baby I'm back in town, town

I wanna play with you all night long
Then after tonight

And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, I don't know

You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world that you've got love in your heart
Oh no, gotta play this shit back

And eventually there's gon' be so many niggas
There's one white girl told me she hate white cock
That's when I knew hip hop was the new rock
When you know you gotta keep your business zip-la
Cause the nigga still got her Gucci flip-flops
Old bitches know I put the dick on they dentures
Might tell 'em Lexington Steele is my mentor
Famous people act so damn pretentious, huh?
What she need is an hour of some inches, huh?
Got a thick dick hopping on some trenches, huh?
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches. huh?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian, huh?
She spent a whole check on some Christians, huh?
And that bitch ain't even religious, huh?
I'm respected, I'm way too prestigious
Crack coke, crack sale, white niggas got mail
Might drop a baby line and call that shit Pastel
Walkin', livin', breathin', god, you know my past well
Bad bitches fuckin' Rob, though he overweight
Hah, huh, what you want?
Want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack?

I need at least seven days with Chloe Sevigny
Since I saw Brown Bunny, it ain't never been the same
I ain't gon' tell ya that I've never been a lame, but
Ever since with Hov, I got that Roc-A-Fella chain
Man, shit just changed, shit just changed
My nigga Dame said let's get this change
Get this thing, iPhone thing

Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Yeh, the Fear of God's in you muthafuckers
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her Bachelor's
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it's revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I'm free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I'll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what's my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, watch how many nigga's plans change

And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it
I need more drinks and more lights
Hot American Apparel girl in just tights
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
What's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach
But God said I need a different approach
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that ya'll

Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I'm Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside this pinata
And rolling kilos in gymstrada is one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women whom
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome
But adios I blow my own dice before I toss 'em, loss 'em
Some other muthafuckers double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune
Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih
Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But the devil red, tires double tread
I'm posting parks up. that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look what the devil did

It's hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention
As long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus
And I assisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, fans can't resist it
Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!

Let me get more volume
Nah, nah
Louder than my voice

Roll some, think I'll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know, I know, I know when I see it
Riding down the 405, baby
Pacing, thinking, to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Don't know why, but I know a sign when I see it

Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Whoooooooaa
Never leave me alooooooooone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone
I'll be coming home

My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now I'm talkin about Chi-town

I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?

I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
Timbuck2, Timbuck2, Timbuck2

I got 11 plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single damn nigga, wow

H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Yall niggas want credit but yall need to slow down
Kanye to the killin yall from Chi-town, how your wife gon say
She never sold drugs a day in her life, but she still wanna pump the Ye
And yall mad cuz yall not knowin, cause these canaries so yellow
When yall pull up whether to stop or keep goin
I got G's, rock Rock n Roll tees wit no sleeves
Tats showin, tucked in strap showin'
How he get seven tv's in that 'lac 'lac
3 in the front, 2 in the back, 2 in that back, back
While you in that hatchback
And tryin to sell work and don't get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studios won't give you ya daps back
And try to get publishin, all you get in your ass capped
And that's that

Magazines call me a rock star, bitches call me cock star
Billboard pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-town go-getting pimps, we mob-stars
Gingerbread man even says "You're a monster"
Remember that, uh-huh, that's that Shrek shit
Remember back in '92 niggas used to catch reck shit
Remember that track I tracked for you bout 3 months ago
Uh-huh that's the one, now cut my check bitch
And I ain't feeling that Lexus - more that CLK
See me like "damn! A CL K!?"
Yeah that's how we eating and, keep us looking peace and then
I ain't know he rap as good as he do beats, and then

Broke, broke, broke phi-

I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us
There is an imposter among us
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!

I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-

No, you speak up, brother!

I was gon' stick-I'm tryin to stick to my roots and-

What?

I wanna stick to my roots, and-

What's next?

I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
Much more, much more than this
I did it my way...

It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got 'Ye, but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up at Baseline recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke
Now I'm good bitch
I ain't no Kennedy
But I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beatin', but never broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though
We needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us like we almost white
Almost

Niggas wanna diss K
On their local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya?
A little arrogant with all your comparisons
Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap
And nah, y'all ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough
How I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin'
Shut your pie hole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though?
Why? Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro!
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Awww, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nawww, he's got titties under his shirt

When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, fuck that, dog, I get my own way
Niggas ain't believe me, 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay 4 stars or better
Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's
Polo and Carbesher's, we into them things dawg
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dawg
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dawg
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off

Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
When The Dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
With so much personality, what do you want from me?
I could be by myself and enjoy the company
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
Bad chick, this award, is for Melyssa Ford
'94 I could only afford this Accord
From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive
Where you at? The whole city behind us

It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here
To shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid
A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin tested
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Out West they still bangin, up top it's really gully
Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!
Big city bright lights - and many pity cause we like fights
May be long days but it's fright nights
Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?'
Not the club; I stay in the get right!
Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts
Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt!
From Decatur down to CP, and EP
Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P

It's Compton's prodigy
Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steerin column
Of Impalas in to get holla
We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers
In the projects the objective is make dollars
'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage
I ain't never been to college, got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar
If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla
To all the Y.G.s in khakis and white tees
With And 1's in every color like Ice-T
I might be the city of Compton's right knee
The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures
Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism
Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision
Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf
Of Luda and Kanyeezy, I'm gon' breathe easy

I've been waiting for a minute
Pour out, ayy
For my lady, and I

Had more than another episode
Last time I was down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
Especially when we in a Giuseppe store
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh in the end

Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let 'em get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

Nah, don't stop it
Oh, life's a feeling, yeah
Oh, the body's a feeling, yeah
The future is uncertain
For us all, just stop
Why make things worse?

The brown hero, live from Ground Zero
Machine gun flow, made of ghetto Ross Perot
And this is disestablishmen-tarianism
With my night goggles on, yeah, military vision
And it's still a very Christian way to think about livin'
When you prayin' for freedom 'cause your mind been in prison
'Cause they tryin' to control every single big decision
You ain't effin' the system, then why the eff is you livin'?
Look, dawg, you can cop whatever suits you on
Three-piece, cuff links and the accoutrements
They been feedin' us ish without the nutrients
So I'm back with another hit to let the truth be known
And your boy still fresh with the Gucci on
Them Italians sure know how to make what the moulies want
And they really can't take what dude be on
But I be on the same thing 'til you prove me wrong

This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'mma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gonna be some different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?

Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
Just got a stripper chick
Something feel different
Cute little college chick, lining up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
Ain't that a true bitch?
Let me show you how to do this shit

Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that Jesus?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's

Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
That'll give her access
Let me show you what happened

Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits?
Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'mma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsay Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say fuck getting them D's
I'mma just ride out with these

Now ya know ya gotta turn this super loud
C'mon now let's go, uh

Let me hear say "Yeaaah"
"Yeaaah"

I know you're wondering
How is Kanye spittin so hot?
Cuz I listen to the ROC
And I listen and watch
And the first thing I copped was a glistening watch
Off that Blueprint money
Yeah I know I'm a dummy
But what I am supposed to tell a girl in the club, why that ass is getting feeled on
What, I bought a couple build-ons?
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
'Cause on the real son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid then she's thinking 'bout her children
Feel him?
Prolly not though unless you got dough
You know what I mean
You would think the grass green when you finally get green

She has no idea what she's doing in college
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs ain't picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Single black female addicted to retail and

Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
Just to be like, "Nigga you ain't up on this!"
And I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coope

And uh
I decided to stop fuckin with yall
Wack ass niggas
And uh hating-ass dream killin'-ass niggas
And since I quit
Everyone that supported me
Thank you very much
And everyone that doubted me
Thank you very little

I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and quit playin' with that bitch

Too fresh, man, to be a class clown
Graduated when I sat down
They don't want you to show your ass
Let's talk about the Raf now
Let's talk about the stash now
Hella niggas send my ho's up
Every now and then, on the Act, wow
Maybe sing a little, bitch, I act wild
Bitches rubbing on me like a frat child

Man, you got to hate it, man you got to hate it
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated

Man, I'm underrated, over-overstated
Rappin' over thirty, talkin' out related
That's captivated, Grammy nominated
Your shit outdated, my shit upgraded

Man, you got to hate it, man I'm motivated

McDonalds Man
The french fries had a plan
The salad bar and the ketchup made a band
Cus the french fries had a plan

McDonalds
I know them french fries have a plan
The cheeseburger and the shakes formed a band
To overthrow the french fries plan
I always knew them french fries was evil man
Smelling all good and shit
I don't trust no food that smells that good man
I don't trust it
I just can't

McDonalds, damn
Them french fries look good though
I knew the Diet Coke was jealous of the fries
I knew the McNuggets was jealous of the fries
Even the McRib was jealous of the fries
I could see it through his artificial meat eyes
And he only be there some of the time
Everybody was jealous of them french fries
Except for that one special guy
That smooth apple pie

That new Rihanna in the front
Bitches in the back they don't like me though
Why? I can tell you 'bout stupid hoes
Why? I bet she don't act stupid though

Cuz I cut a bitch
I fuck a bitch, go and find another bitch
And I never trust a bitch
You done touched a nigga 30 times
On some baby mother shit
Talkin' bout you celibate
But you still suckin' dick
This that half a brick, quarter brick
Aye, come and place your order bitch
More of that gutter shit

New Rihanna in the front
Bitches in the back, she don't like me though
Why? I don't know, she might be broke
Why? I can tell you bout stupid hoes

She know that I have sex with 'em
If you tryin' get lit then go ahead light it ho
What you bitches fightin' for?
Nah, I can't even that's why you can't sit with us
You need to just sit your ass down
I heard you fucked that nigga well I fucked that nigga too
And they probably didn't tell you that's what suckers niggas do
And if he had a chance with me he would have never fucked with you

Bitches in the back, they don't like me though
Why? Side piece 'bout to let wifey know
Why? Thirsty hoes is tryin' get chose

Cut that bitch in the bathroom
I cut that bitch in the bathroom
I bet you need to quit playin', quit playin' with me bro

Got a nigga fucked up up in here
You know I'm sayin?
A bitch say she don't like me, you ask her why, she go
"I don't know," just like some shit stupid bitches say
KnowImsayin?

When I came up had to show my ass, yeah
Clothes tight, clothes tight, holds tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
And I just figured out the whole time
Uh, I was actin' like I'm white

When I came up, had to show my ass, yeah, that's the black side
I was trappin' out the bando, nosy ass neighbors uptight
When I come around, when I come around, niggas don't act right
I'm yellin' out, "Please don't come with that fake shit," screamin' it all night
When you're aiming for something I tell 'em
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, see that melody right there? That's why I'm me

100 bump, I do that shit all night
Sniff a line
I be sniffing Miley Cyrus with Miley Cyrus
In a bathroom with my thumb in her ass
Now I'm actin' like I'm white

You stayed 3 exes up and you never came to see me in my own room
You the only good enough for the mountain
Only good as the people you got around you
This is all associations around you
Forgive me if I ever doubted you
Please forgive me if I ever doubted you

Ayy, 'cause I'm actin' like I'm white
Don't make me show my ass, that's the black side
Yeah, I'm actin' like I'm white
'Cause I'm actin' like I'm white

I'm chillin', pourin' up until I can't feel my anger
Blessed my nigga Yeezy with a banger
I was sharin' all my thoughts with a stranger
Wrestle this bitch like Kurt, no Angle
I can see them diamonds drippin' off me like a sink
Act inside a pineapple mango
I just want a round house, we gon' have 'em bleedin'
Nah, I ain't green, sharin' is carin', bae, I be just feedin'
Coca Cola shape, I don't want to fuck it bae, I just want see it
Lil nigga late, I been done did but you just ain't see it
Wait, lil' nigga, I can afford it
I just was broke with no shawty
I just found out it's important
To take off the factories and put on some Forgies
I got six rings, I'm just lordin'
Now all my pockets is on Norbit

They mad 'cause we grinded up from the top
I was on the block, no guap, runnin' from cops
They talk about me, they wanted to see the album flop
And we will never stop, the game on Buscemi lock
I do wrong and do right, forgive me for not livin' right
Sippin' on Bud, like givin' you advice I'm actin' white
Mansion on acres, my white friends I only invite
Even when I'm wrong, it feel like a nigga right

This was founded years ago
By broke slaves, years ago
Who did not have, years ago
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago
Who did not have when we could not eat
Hmm, remember that?
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm?
Do you remember all those Christmases when your mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh?
Remember that?

Yo, this sound like some movie shit, right?
Get your popcorn, get your condiments
You don't wanna miss nothing, okay, listen

They call me Edward Scissorhands 'cause I'm trying to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gon' get you to suck
And you not gon' use your teeth, you hear?
You gon' find out What Lies Beneath right here
The Preacher's Wife don't give head, get a divorce, man
The Kids been calling you the headless horseman
Like Sleepy Hollow, see she swallow
Suck like ol' girl, got booed at Apollo 13, Ghosts
Use my Hollow Man for Friday 13th
You be Ghost, Backdraft from the toast
Niggas who drop names is oh so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, they Almost Famous
My bling got 'em calling me Lord of the Rings
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
But I Don't Say a Word, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell

And I'm living a movie, not living by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
One, two, Ye coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never sleep again

Shit's deeper than the Sleepers
The Jeeper Creep up on your block and cops Clock-us
Try to Baller Block-us, use Absolute Power
You gave him 9 Weeks, why you trying to Rush Hours, huh?
And in The Cell don't drop soap in the showers, huh
They try to give me Life, I'm out in an hour, huh
Back on the block with more Juice than Pac
Making mo' money 'cause of The-The-The-The Roc

Yo, what you talking about, man?

I said some shit like, umm
If you in my things, you Suicide Kings
There's only Three Kings, Me, Myself and Irene
You know what I'm saying?

Gangster? I don't buy it -- you can't sell me nothing
I'm everything you thought I wasn't
Now check out how I does it on this K. West production
All your bullshit, I will flush it
And I got the paper to wipe that ass
Every little song and dance come out, y'all hype that trash
And yo, I'm far from a hater
Cause suckers gotta eat too -- get y'all paper
I ain't mad at cha -- I just can't deal with these fake rappers
Cause most of these niggas wear they boxers backwards
Niggas claim king but can't govern they household
Now real niggas doing time from shit they mouth told
Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing

La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team
We speak the truth and they believe us
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane

Yeah homie, this the theme song
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional and my chain so fresh, they go
But after the fame, did you gain anything?
Damn, 'Ye, would you change anything?
I'd cop more pink Polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname "Sorrow"
"Wait 'til I get my money" everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah -- hey mama, they can't hate 'em
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

Listen -- I ain't worried 'bout shit
It's a Roc-a-fella/GMG invasion, bitch
You hear them niggas talking 'bout me? Ain't that some shit
These niggas is like bitches -- they all on my dick
They don't want no real G to get in position
I opened up the door so all my real niggas could get in
Roc-a-fella, Def Jam, GMG it's on
Uncle Murda coming for the motherfucking throne
Listen, you could call me the king of New York
You can't front, I'm doing my thing
If it wasn't for the chronic and these bad-ass ho's
I'd be shooting motherfuckers everywhere I go, oh
But the head I be getting got me chilling
Got a nigga like, let me focus on these millions, man
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
They don't really want no beef, they ain't life-threatening
I'm puffing purple haze with that sour diesel
Can't forget that kush -- I'm high as a eagle
And just cause I'm high off that marijuana
Don't mean I don't see them niggas creeping around the corner
They goners

I got more TV's in here than where I live

And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit
I wearing my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canary's is gleaming through my angel wings
They see me, hoes acting like they seen a king
My woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip-toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie, drive slow

Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen a lot clearer after time had passed
Known for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, he constantly mashing
"Why don't he slow down?" they be constantly asking
But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't trying to say that it's the way of the masses
But it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and Sigel cutting classes, showing our ass
Shooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember selling crack faster than I could bag it
Just sharing my past with you shawty, I ain't bragging
Me and Cap got life, some other folk got blasted
Had a partner O.D. and after this all happened
It's like the only thing that kept a pimp from crying is laughing
And the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'd make it this far rapping
For introducing the youth to what we now call "trappin'"
Considered now a classic, who'd have imagined?
Me in Milano getting models in next year's fashions
So nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashing
Life about who make it now, not about who make it the fastest

Good God
Midwest coast back nigga
And don't say nigga unless of course you black nigga
Free country they say that shit in Tennessee
Cuz I got all they white daughters drinking Hennessy
I'ma go to Sal's, put some niggas on a wall
I might go to Oz take some niggas off the wall
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano so involved
I know
King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had 2 polos
We the kids they keep in the back
They askin' bout the help and all I do is laugh

Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
'ey what a bam bam
Bam bam eh
Bam bam

I wish all wack niggas'd get out the game
You can't con me, that's half my name
And if you had any brains
You wouldn't wanna lose half your brain
By hating on players in the game
Wack nigga, the beat go, "Duh-duh-da"
And then your flow go way the fuck off
I kill y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
But I'm not trying to cause commotion
And have my niggas bring all the toast in
I just want your girl to rub my balls with lotion
'Cause you got madder, ripped down all my posters
But you came at me like "Yo, I got the Kia with the woodgrain"
Yeah you would, lame
"On the real, in the streets I got the good name, I got the TV"
Yeah, that's good, man

It's time to change up, my lyrics rip your frame up
Asking if I'm nice, like fucking with a chick that don't give head
That's a no-brainer
Niggas pack bangers y'all don't even know the names of
I'm about to meet the quota, you about to meet the savior
Wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got
Word, not that I'm wilding or even promoting violence
It's just you fucking up my high, can't a nigga smoke in silence?
You wack niggas

Wake up in the morning, dawg, you just a wack niggas
I'd kill myself if I was that wack niggas
Everything you wear and rock is just wack niggas
Even if you flossing rocks, you just wack niggas
You can't do it, dawg, you's a wack niggas
Biting ass, bitch ass, trick ass wack niggas
Even your daughter says, "My Daddy's a-" wack niggas
You wack nigga!

Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
Black Benz, white truck and one two-seater
Wack niggas hold hands and follow the procedure
'Cause I got enough tools that one gon' leave you
If I drop enough dudes, man, one gon' reach you
If they build enough schools, man, one gon' teach you
Kanye the shit, but I ain't trying to be facetious

Wake up in the morning and dawg, you just a wack niggas
Gotta name drop to get a girl naked wack niggas
Plus your ass can't sell one record wack niggas
"My Daddy's a wack nigga"

Well
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Okay

Woo Woo Woo Woo Woo Woo Woo wu-woo

Nah Nah-nah-nah nah-nah-nah nah-nah-nah nah-nah

Duh Duh Duh Du-duh Duh Duh Duh Du-duh
Duh Duh Duh Du-duh Duh Duh Duh

Okay Lamborghini Mercy
I'm in that two-seat Lambo with your girl
She tryna jerk me

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Wu-waaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wu-waaaaaaaaaaaa Wu-waaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Uh, G.O.O.D. Music, this our year
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here?
Y'all niggas know you can't really fuck with that
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everybody fasting
CyHi Da Prynce
Fuck that and that's just common sense what the

Came in Grindin', Ye' came through the wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone Thugs inspired
Red toupee on the coupe you been fired
Still let that butter fly like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry McGuire

Detroit's angel, I even got red wings
I'm Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter, Sean Combs and Connery all in one
She feelin on my whoo there right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her and im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
Last year I was watching this from the couch and now I'm here
Thats to let you know what I'm about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team's killin'
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin'
Tell me who the baddest, I'll see if I see them naked yet

I'm Mr. Got Bread like Quizno's
If being dope made you broke I am piss poor
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for?
I'm coming after you, him and his spot!
Still tied to the streets like a fish knot
Atlanta repper in the home of the yankee
Rosewood suit on with the hanky
So I'm flexible stretching out my decimals
And if you bite me, it's good for you like a vegetable

F-f-f-fam fam fam I'ma monster too
About my audible technique, my technique
I recognize game like the ESPY's
Cold to myself I say "God bless me" the truth

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
I'm an only child lost in the world
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk
I stopped visitin around the time I was a sophomore

Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of 'em coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go...

Every sunset feel righter, sunshines feel brighter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like God wrote this, I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you noticed, them accident pictures is bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cause that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can
Drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I went before Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throwin' some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Out the blue girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident, they tellin' me that it's the cheeks
But if you look at history, the last rapper that almost died

All of them coulda been lost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Hecky naw that boy is raw

Now even though I ain't wired up
We-we-we fired up
You ain't seen my concerts lately, they be linin' up
You ain't seen my girls lately, they be tryin' to cut
And they heard about my girl so I still chill
Cause Monica Lewinsky already killed Bill
And that girl that was with Kobe tried to go for the kill
I think he put it in the wrong Holyfield
Can I take a minute with y'all to be totally real?
Far as my jaw and all, it ain't totally heal
If I would have died, 10/23 of last year
That would have threw a monkey wrench in my whole career
But me, I took the worst thing, turn it into the best thing
I'm from the Chi, I guess it's just a Midwest thing
Times like this make life interesting
Times like this make me count my blessings
Cause you could run around like King of the Chi
But God could take that in a blink of a eye
I remember Cedars-Sinai and all those cryin'
Mama, I'm sorry for almost dyin'
Tell Alwe G and Hip Hop man
Tell Don I'ma John Monopolize the game
Add on Benny Medina, we gon' take 'em to the cleaners
I'm Kanye West, the college dropout slash genius

Now if the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Now keep 'em in the air
We outta here
College Dropout

I've been waiting my life; and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind; it's been way too much time
That's why...It's just impossible - It's im-poss-ible
And you know that..

I don't wanna hear that bull shit, I wanna hear that official shit
Get it, that's so impossible to get it

Ain't no way you could pull up to the party
Ain't no way you could cook up in the studio
Ain't no way that you could win
Dust some haters off while I'm sippin on my Henn'
Holla at a chick while she sippin on her gin
For you to ever be the nicest
You ain't get gangsta or get righteous
You ain't never stood on a tip like this
For you to get it if you don't wanna win; so get up off ya ass
And go for yours, and never for mine
Now you ain't from the ride that I'm in
Know what I'm sayin'...

It's impossible for you to ever get with me because of how I ride on the track
Got the bitch in the back of the billy yo? When my celeb
Niggas always hatin'
Leaving me for wilin' out for po kim
You be sittin' back talking your shit
Lil mama, for you to fit all that up in a pants; movin' kinda wilder
Turn a regular jeans in a low riders
For you to ever deny, that I'm about Chi-town
Represent the city with the deal for 12 years
And sell a couple of mil and still hold it down, that's possible

Get it, roll the weed up and, lit it
Smoke a little but don't, admit it
Do it like I did too late, I did it
The controversy can't worse me man; I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty what is you saying
I gotta a duel with a couple niggas that's Thursday man
Why the hell is I'm worrying, hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10
"Man your life must be perfect man, look at how they came up with the perfect plan"
It's impossible
Got strip clubs playin gosspital
Girl so sick in the hospital
You know I jumped out like 'Pac'll do
You know you throw your diamonds when I rock with you
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
I done did shit on logical
Maybe cause we did the impossible
Maybe we done did the impossible

No matter what I do, see I been waitin' all my, waitin' all my life, yeah
And I know I stayed on my grind, I know I stayed on my grind
It's impossible for me to fail baby, I gotta keep on movin'
Gotta keep on movin', it's impossible

I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back

Now I see

Como eres? Subale
Come on in I'm super paid
Song for song I'm dubaday
Just got off now I'm suitless
Watch how you talk to me
Now I need y'all to hear this
I need a 100 racks
That's just my talking fee
Just playin'
I'm just sayin' a lotta niggas
Ain't been lost as me

I got that gold stuff off on my back
I can't feel it oh
All of these waves
Oh baby, down to make me
Move

I caught a wave
Caught more air than Super Dave
Call Aaliyah, I'm super paid
Jet lag, and tryna recuperate
Just got off the flight from Budapest
Don't need Khaled, just say "you the best!"
You the type of nigga to shop at Uniqlo
Just found out my father-in-law unisex
Running out of money, running into debt
Running from bill collectors, I ain't pay them yet
Shit you did, with no matter how rich you get
And even more, depending on the bitch you get
I be getting worried for my niggas getting married, seriously

Yeah! Uh

This song right here changed my life come on, come on!

God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down

Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil tryin' lure me, it fury me
My pastor's shakin' his head
He ain't sure of me, but surely
They asked, do you say your prayers at least two a week?
I ain't talking to God, I know what I've been doin' G
Do you know how I be embarrassed?
My prayers sound like Ben Stiller's on Meet the Parents
And I ain't good, what they give us this day
The slaves is trying to give us this free
I'm trying to give us this pay
Man, you know how 'dem strippers was
We was all ghetto fabulous
All at the rooms in the Sybaris
From this jacuzzi water, can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cartier lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died, falling asleep in them Benzes
It's something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And He gives me direction when I can't decide
He is alive
How can you tell me that He ain't when I said

And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that

Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio playing
Is cause you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats wit knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who re up for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it

God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down

Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of Him
Now walk with me
Walk with me, walk, walk, walk with me
Walk with me

Uh, uh
Let's take it back to basics
When shit gets worse, we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got, if we don't shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I don't wanna have to check you
I'm Chi as Buck-Fiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough, I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonald's with the flow, served over over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building
Uh, I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when the Workout Plan ain't work out, man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
I open my eyes, the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized, the black enterprise, the passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?

Whooooooooooo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?
Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me
That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo
She said "He gay anyway, you don't know nothin' about Jamario"

Why would she make calls out the blue

Take off your cool, then lose control

I wish this song, this song could play and could come true
I wish this song, "Say You Will," would come true
I wish this song
I admit I, don't say, I admit I, don't say I admit I

I admit I, I admit I
Say you will, say you will
Don't say I, don't say I

I know you're tired of loving, of loving

What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
They ordered champagne, why they look thirsty?
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
It's like the first time back in the basement
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit

So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, body

Just grab somebody, no leaving this party

Everything I do that's not perfect
Only makes it that, that, that much more perfect
Only makes it that, that, that, that much more worth it
Only, only only, only every time when I short-circuit
Only makes it that much, much, much more perfect
Much more perfect, I need it all
I want it all, I need it all, go through it all, climb every wall
Take every fall, break every law, I need it all, I need it all
Go through every wall, take every fall, break every law
Yeah, I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
And I will have it all, and I will have it all, and I will have it all
They ain't laughin' at me, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Nah, I laugh at y'all, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Think you're laughin' at me, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Cause I want it, I want it, I want everything
I want it, everything, I want it all, I want it all, yeah, I want it all
I want it all, all the shit they talk, all the shit they write
All the shit they write, oh, I love it, all the shit they talk
All the shit they write, all that shit to say, you know I love it
Oh, I want it all, I need it all, I need it all
Give it to me right now, I want it all
I'll take it all, take every fall, break every law
Go through every wall, I don't give a fuck, I need it all

My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the qualm uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card
I turned around and replied why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express

La La La La La Off MTV
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me

Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say There's something I might play
A beat I might made might make they life change
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill You could be Lauryn Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'mma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now y'all just prayin

You was a vic in high school now you a thug
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggas see the light got fat girls eating right

Ha ha we in this bitch
It's Common and Kanye y'all niggas know what time it is
Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters what up?
Mike Love What Up? DJ Enuff
That's why I had to rap on this Cuz

My tracks is Better Than Yours
Just Blaze tracks is Better Than Yours

That's all

Father
This prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough This prayer's for everybody that feels they're too messed up
Let them know that's why you took the nail
So we could have eternal life
If all God's children would get down on their knees and pray
And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away
You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again
But I won't make it, God, if you let go of my hand
Prayer for our homes and our families
God! God! God! God! God!

Welcome to your life
Diamond through the light
This Miami vice
You don't know how to act right
Everybody wants to rule the world

Pardon, I'm gettin' my scream on

Actin' on your worst behavior
Turn your back on all your haters
Everybody wants to rule the
The world

Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch

Everybody wanna move it
Get inside it, why they do it
Everybody, ride a little bit
Everybody, body do it
Do it

So unfair, so.. unfair advantage

It's the dream, it's Kobe and Jordan on the same team
In the best prime of their game and the same Kanye
You know the name and it's not pronounced Kane
And every time, you know I spit that flame
Ayo we gettin' out our dreams, gettin' out our dreams
And we gonna buy some things, and we got him out of Queens
Talkin' 'bout my man Consequence, once for the Tribe
Talkin' 'bout my man GLC and now he's around
Talkin' 'bout John Legend, take 'em all the way to Heaven
Speakin' of Heaven, Common speaks the heavenly words
The nouns and verbs and whatever you heard
Whatever synonym, we killin' 'em, everybody feelin' him
The people's choice, the people's champ like Paul Wall
All haters, I gotta say fuck all y'all
No, I won't waste my energy no more
I have to be more concerned about Sierra Leone
I'm talkin' 'bout people that's dyin' for diamonds
And the way that uh
They got uh, capa
What I want to say, monopoly over the country
And every time you say somethin' people act funky
The diamond industry want me, they say I'm bringin' out the bad
What I want, people to stop buyin' diamonds?
No, I want everybody to stop lyin'
They say conflicts is only one percent, and look at all the money rappers spent
We throw the diamonds in the screen, nah mean?
But it affects the families cause people is dyin' for these things
I mean in the diamond rivers they'll mine all day
And might only get paid two cups of rice a day
Is this the price to pay for the icy way?
We like to floss away, even your boy 'Ye
With my Jesus piece, I gave diamonds to my niece
If I had a brother, Kanye, Common made "I Used to Love H.E.R."
Used to love her and I still do, lyrically I kill you
Dog I don't feel you, your style is like mildew
Real old, I'm real cold, listen to this beat, real soul
Your style is real old, dollar bill fold
Stackin' money ain't funny, and I'm out in UK
And I ask 'em who's the best, and they say "you K"
Ooh way ooh way
Yeah I feel it and I gotta kick it off the top of the dome
Microphone controller, that's an M.C., it's in me
I can lead a crowd, I went to your show, it's empty
Go to my shit, it's sold out, every single seat
Every time I drop, because like Shaq, I bring the heat
And anybody that freestyle on the level that I do
Should be winnin' Grammys too
So if you do it like me, you can do it like this
And uh, they say I'm a teacher like the one called Kris
That's KRS but nah it's Kanye West
And every time I spit the rhymes, uh straight off the flesh
I could bring it down to the bone straight from the heart
And from the heart is where I did it 'fore I ever chart
And then I spit it, we get it, we did it, we do it a lot
Kanye spit it, we do it, we makin' it hot
I got patterns like Saturn, the rings, the rings
Uh, Gold Digger, that's the single, the single
Gotta hit the club just to mingle, to mingle
Why you all in my face? I'm tryna do my thing dude
Back off, I'll have Barry smack the fuck out of you
Everybody wanna know what they can get out you
Aww here's my demo, dawg, here's my group
Dawg, please back me up, you're heated up, you're soup
Y'all gassed, I passed, I flow, I rhyme
I'm uh, that's the way, that yah boy gotta shine
Straight from the Chi city, everybody ride with me
And you see the same questions and I gotta teach the lesson
This some, this some sick freestylin', I hear you're readin' it
I gotta keep goin' cause y'all fans, y'all needin' it
Uh, you say I'm too high like I smoke weed in it
And they say "he arrogant, he's always conceited, shit"
Well what you want from me? Y'all just can't stop me
You could look in my pants and tell that I'm cocky

We back, we back like we ever left, huh
Like we ever left, huh, like we e', like we ever left, huh
Like we ever left, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah

Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Kanye on the Westwood Tour
Chillin' with Westwood
Go to Chicago, that's Kanye West's hood
And the label called G.O.O.D
Should I holla at these bitches? You should
You might need one, you might need one
You might fuck one
If you eat out like McDonald's
I ain't no clown like Ronald
Uh, more like Donald
Trump, with the way I get it crunk
Like my man Lil Jon, but call him Lil Kan'
He all the same, flow like Lil Wayne on Tha Carter
And I'm signed to the Carter faculty
'Cause the Roc is in back of me
Actually, that look like stacks to me
Ch-ching, ch-ching
Yah nahmean, yah nahmean, I'm doin' my thing
Out in U.K., London
And they call me number one
Japan, you're number one
That's Ichiban
And I learned that from KRS-One
Won once again like One
Like Puff, my friend, and One
One, give me one of them
Talkin' 'bout one drink, one hand
One cup of Henny, one cup of Hypno
If you ran out of it, yo, you got to get more
And I might sip slow but I never sip Mo
I sip Cris-o, Cris-y-Cris
And I gotta break it down like Missy Miss
She had the "hee hee, who got the keys?"
You don't need that if you got the no start V
Where you push the button, that ain't nothin'
All y'all talkin' somethin', y'all stay frontin'
Kanye dropped the beats to get 'em jumpin'
Lucifer, top of the morning to yah
Cheerio, hit up the flow, bring it back, oh
From Chicago, uh
And I'm rockin' the Dolce Gabbana
Fashionable persona
GQ, who knew he'd be the flyest?
Like T.W.A.C.W.K
K.A.N.Y W.E.S.T
Be the B.E.S.T

You know, I'mma stop it right there
I 'on't know if I feel like rappin' right now

I got raps for yah, uh huh
I got raps for yah
I got, uh, I got raps for yah
We goin' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say
I 'on't know, I 'on't know what
I got so many joints right know, runnin' through my head
I 'on't even know what to yeah
What should, what should I spit?
I could just freestyle off of these messages
Please can you tell
Okay this is a girl writin' this
Please can you tell my uh, boyfriend Danny
That I love him loads, with all my heart
And I can't wait to see him tomorrow

She can't wait to see you tomorrow Danny
She love you, mhmm
You know what that mean?
You gonna get some
I wonder if she gon' be wearin' one of those tight outfits
And you know that I like that shit
I ain't sayin' I ever met her but come on
You must be pimpin' and you ain't sweat her, you know?
She writin' you on one of these hip-hop shows
Made me wonder if she's a hip-hop ho
No disrespect, you know
I don't know you so
I will not disrespect, so don't please press eject
On the tape cassette, and don't knock it out of your decks
So with much respect, obliged, when I rhyme
Sometimes some things just pop out, sometimes
I must be a, I forgot the medical name
Not a narcoleptic that be sleepin'
How people was sleepin' when I made it deeper
And I gotta be creepin' cause you know they didn't peep it
Uh, they call me Rockafella's best little secret
Uh, I got the beats for the Jeep
When people used to rock Amigo's and Suzuki's
And the Isuzu's, this the way you flow
Do flow, aye yo you just like Menudo
Played out about mad years ago
And uh, I could rock off the top, I got years of flow
I got so many albums to go, at least about seven
Jesus Walks had me all the way
Thought I was gon' rhyme that, no you didn't time that
Yo that's where the line's at
Look at my shows, look how long that the line's at
All the way to the back, sold out, one night
That's the way it is when you done it right
Take time to drop a album, don't just be buyin' beats from everybody
Cause everybody ain't got it, I got it
I get it, I only give it to those who really live it
Like Jay-Z, the Game, and my dogs that really did it
Like Kweli, like Common, like dudes that really spit it
I'm talkin' 'bout they go onto the radio and hit it
And as far as makin' your songs, it's all wrong
You be doin' everything that everybody else is on
Man, I'mma break it down, let me take it down
Here goes the instructions on how to not say nothin'
Look, you take the crack concept
And you do that 'til it's all dead and gone, you do it all wrong
Now uh, you take the car concept
And I see it every video, every single place I go
Same shit

Man you know the beat ran out on me
I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna break down
Exactly how to make the good song and the good album for a change

First of all, what you need's a beat from me
If you can't get a beat from me, get a beat from your guy
He'll prolly do it for free
Yo, yo-yo, yo-yo-yo, you gotta bring with your flow
You gotta take it on-beat and off-beat
And don't rap on no fuckin' soft beats
You know that real hard shit, regardless, I played my part in this
Like, this Corner beat, this what you want when you want a beat
And that's when you really is gonna be
A hip-hop legend like Kan, like Kan
Like, of course the Louis Vuitton, 'ton, don, don
If I do say so, myself
And I do all the time, every rhyme
Cause I'm, I'm feelin' myself
And if you was me, you'd be feelin' yourself, you see
If you out in London, you just hopped on a plane
And you just came out of the bathroom, you just got you some brain
Uh, you doin' your thing
And plus you flossin' that Rocafella chain
Aye yo, you know you let Kan spit on 'em
I'm rockin' the Rocafella chain with no conflicts on 'em
Now let me bring it back to the flow, flow
And how you make the album and you make some dough, dough
Get you a good manager cause your manager'll fuck your game up
Fuck your name up
Trade your chain for some studio time
See a lot of people be flossin' before they get a chance to
A lot of people want club records they wanna dance to
A lot of people want basslines, they will enhance you
Bass in the club is good too, what you should do
Is prolly get a single like Alicia Keys
And if you don't know her, holla at Alicia please
You know one of 'em light skin bitches with the braids
Actin' like they got it made
You get somebody that's weak, you get somebody that you know can't flow
And you rap before him, and let him go
And people gon' be like well least you was better than dude
And another thing you can do
If you could channel the spirits like I channel
I'm not talkin' 'bout lightin' candles, I'm not talkin' sayonce
I'm talkin' 'bout talkin' to God, I mean just like once
What I do before I rhyme, every day is I pray
I pray to God that he make these songs in a certain way
I let him speak through me, through the beats, through the music
I mean, sometimes I go into the booth and lose it
I mean, I know he speakin' when I freak it in it a way
That I coulda never thought of somethin' better to say
So, our father, who art up above us
I know any time we fuck, you still love us
Like when I'm cursin' in my verses and I even do, what's worse is
When I'm spendin' too much, spendin' on purses
And shoes for my girl when I should be helpin' the world
Give back to the charity, he still don't embarrass me
He still let me be, He still keep it real
See that's the thing about humans, we got free will
See the angels gotta do exactly what God want 'em to do
God is still with you, even when we don't do
So, follow the path, follow the laws
Follow the reason, the reasons why it's wrong
You never heard a freestyle like this before-'fore
And I know that hip-hop fans want more

Westwood, what's good
Holla at your boy, Kanye the Louis Vuitton Don
The Roca stay, buildin'
Yeah, it's G.O.O.D. Music baby
After you freestyle like that you just talk shit for about eight minutes

It's like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it's from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn't reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss 'em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon' test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
"Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?"
Say 'he ain't clean enough'
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a 'toast for the douche bags'
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin' my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't 'Jesus Walks'
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin' wit niggas careers
Felt like I'm the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyonce up to give the award back
Didn't even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin' and stay frontin'
And get up and just perform, shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit 'bout
My whole family, now I'm scared of Grammy's
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it's too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya

No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas, I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I'm in the movies
I'm on the ave, I'm in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I'm straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I'm number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on

I know what it's like to feel down little girl
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up

Not long ago I was lower than Lohan
No plan, a lost man, raisin' my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham
My quest success, but my life was a mess
Poor Kenny West, no zest, anti-depressed
Not dressed to impress
Matter fact more stressed
Than John Mayer waiting on his AIDS test
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large
Took me out of my car
Now I'm in his garage
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration
Like Mr. Miagi but a lot less Asian
My game was timid now my flow much bolder
Got a chubby brown angel on my shoulder, sayin'

You know, it don't matter what you do
Cause I'll always be there for you
Be-Cleve in yourself, grow a mustache
Be-Cleve in yourself, slap your wife's ass
Be-Cleve in yourself, never smoke grass
Be-Cleve in yourself, really pass gas
Be-Cleve in yourself, Goochland! Goodnight!

Kanye to the...
Yeah, OK

I'm getting spins all day in L.A
We can go the D where Dwele dwell
D.C, P.G or ATL
Back in the Chi, mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
Far as the penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a Black tail
I'm feeling her vibe, her Body and Soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well lets kill all the parlayin and offer you a cosmopolitan
Lets jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends claim I'm a player, you be lucky to keep me
But you know people gon' be talking 'bout us weekly
My car be in a Robb Re-p-o-r-t but what's more important to me
Is that you..

Open your ears
Don't allow these words to be ignored by years
Dealing just to deal is just a crime
Besides I know you wouldn't mind
Trying something new so..

We can work it out
The way that you feel for me
You should hold on

There's no need to go home
I know you can't enjoy it on your own
Really I don't see nothing wrong
With you and I spending some time--

Is to feed you every single thing you hunger for---
So fulfilled that you will never need to ask for more--

Now someone told my girl that she's a trophy wife
Sorta like Grant Hill and Kobe's wife
So when we at a club, and she be so polite
But when we back at home she be poltergeist
I mean provoking fights
Trying to poke me with knifes
And last time I tried to poke her she just told me goodnight
See her clothing be tight
She was pervert approved
So she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move
Hypnotized by the tube
So she stay with the clicker
In a cup full of liquor
Thinkin its makin her thicker
But its makin her slimmer
So our future is dimmer
I can't remember last time I took my baby to dinner
See I'm sayin' a sister who was freaky and ruthless
In a yorkshire terrier in the pocket with pooches
In a pocket with Gucc's
Was taking my lunch money
Just like the gooches
I'll tell you the truth miss

Yo this is Dirt McGirt
I'm chilling with Kanye West
He's killing y'all niggas on the beats
He's killing y'all niggas on the tracks
Where your plaques at dog
The game is officially over
Go kill yourself

Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

Now y'all gon' stop talking that shit that you talking
Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the hell she gon' afford that coffin
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the Chi since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggas had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggas postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters, dog
Niggas had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards
Now after all that it took, I made it to The Roc
I guess I ain't as dumb as you look

Now I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you niggas' tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rapping and I can't do nothing for you man
Ask G and Hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov, if you ain't Cam
Damn I know you say he's killing hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feeling hisself
Yup just cause I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who your hype man, I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
Here go a new movie for you critics called "Who's Laughing?"
The first producer that rap better than the rappers

Aftermath still making them hits, nigga
Lunatics still making them hits, nigga
So So Def still making them hits, nigga
Bad Boy still making them hits, nigga
Wu-Tang still making them hits, nigga
Ruff Ryders still making them hits, nigga
Cash Money still making them hits, nigga
Dirt McGirt still making them hits, nigga
Yo yo the game is over, go kill yourself
Go yourself nigga

Yo what you doing here huh?
Nice to see you too okay
Yeah you can leave now

Kanye that nigga with heavy dough
Roll dro and a chevy low
Told a long time ago you can't fuck every ho
Whether in Jamaica or Cancun, Mexico
Baby don't be scurred, shake that ass like Mystikal
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Call when I'm sleepin, call my girl claimin we creepin
Bitch you nuts, look I only fucked you once
How you gone get the message, I ain't called you in months
Acting like Super Dave with them dumb ass stunts
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Stalking of course, alone on the phone disguising your voice
Got your girls asking for Kay on the three way
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
Stop, Chill. Relax. okay
You know what she told me?

I'm never letting go
Never letting go

I'm crazy about you

You believe this ho, pop up everywhere I go
Pop up at the show, pop up at the grocery store
Pop up in my kitchen like, "Oh you wash dishes here?"
Pop up in my bathroom, "Oh you take pisses here?"
Listen here we gone need some distance here
You ain't my main bitch not even my main squeeze
Anyway, how the fuck you get a set of keys?
First she used them on my crib, then she used them on my whip
And wrote on the side, "Kanye you ain't shit"
You believe this bitch? Man, did you see this shit!?
That's a twelve fuckin' hundred dollar estimate
She must've took off all yesterday just to hate
Restraining orders ain't stopping her
She the reason caller I.D. so popular
Across the street now with some fuckin binoculars
Screaming at the top of her lungs, "I'm never letting go!"

Had enough of the stalker shit got to put her in line
Count back from ten when I got to nine I grabbed mine
Before I gotta do what I gotta do after blue she lying
Like "Nigga you put your hands on me for the last time"
Tried to get you over your uncles to come and jump me
Take my cash and punk me
With my ass and trump me
I stump them fuckin chunkies
Just look at yo niece
She beat her own ass and called the police
And to my crib scuff me up and put the cuffs on me
My momma dropped that five hundo and got me out of custody
And all the time I got to thinkin that I'm the man
Hottest nigga on the block and shit I got a fan
I'm like a swole nigga thought that he could lift the van
Somebody please come and take this bitch up off my hands!
You don't understand, man

Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
All want a nigga with a chain
Want a nigga whippin that range
Want a nigga banging they brains
Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes

I'll take one question. I wanted to vibe off an idea, and then I can riff off of thatthey said I've got 20 minutes or so, I might go longer

My goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater

We have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia, but we're led by the most greedy and the least noble

We're all creatives here, we're all born artists. Some people are artists of business, some people are artists of composition

I was sitting with Steve McQueen, he shot the visuals for All Day two days ago, it's completely different to the Brit awards

What I said was The Matrix is like the Bible of the post-information age

By the way, I don't know the days of the week. I just go to exactly when my appointment is

This humanity that I talk about, this civilization that I talk about, this future utopia I talk aboutit can only happen through collaboration

I work with an artist called Vanessa Beecroft, and she bought my daughter some toys

In America people really do wear $3000 shirts. For real. Here and in Stockholm people will be like 'oh dude, it's a $3000 shirt'

I'm assuming I'm probably wearing a $2000 shirt but I got it for free from the designer so

We have the ability to approach our race like ants, or we have the ability to approach our race like crabs

This is a generation that is far less racist - yes, small remnants remain of even thinking of calling something of a racial slur

White people that listen to rap say 'nigga'in the privacy of their own home

One of my biggest Achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, the very person, can remove my ego, I think there's hope for everyone

When I talk about collaboration and the creative process, the best idea wins

That's one of my favourite onesto be called crazy

Let's have an NBC telethon moment, and say that beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!

Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you,
I love you and I hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
God talk to me now this is an emergency

And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you at least purposely

We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then

Have you ever felt you want to kill her
And you mixed them emotions with Tequila
On one of them bad nights you have a bad fight
And you talkin' about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say motherfucker your mama's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit
All the attitude
I'll never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you

But Ima be the bigger man
Big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure it's

Bittersweet,

But I been thinking and it got me back to sinkin' it
this relationship even got me back to drinkin' and this Hennessy
Is gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
Coz every time that I try you will question me
Sayin', "You fuckin' them girls, disrespectin' me?
You don't see how your lies is affecting me
You don't see how life was supposed to be
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes'll be."
And this the first time she ever spit her soul to me

I fucked up and I know it G
I guess it's bittersweet poetry

Ayy stop, stop, stop, stop, stop it
Ayy, ayy radio, fuck you!
Radio, fuck you!
Y'all don't wanna lose again
Lotta people here tonight felt like they lost
You know why? Cause y'all been lied to
Google lied to you
Facebook, lying to you
Radio, lying to you
I know there's a lotta real niggas working at radio
Real people, real program directors
With wives and kids that love music that can't play what they wanna play
Because they've been paid to play that bullshit
Over and over and over
And when I said "that bullshit"
I don't mean - what I'm saying, is
We love Drake, Drake is great!
He a great artist!
But Frank Ocean is great too!
But you know who's the greatest of all of us?
Who do y'all think?

Ayy ayy, what'd you say, bro?
Ayy ayy, is it "radio, fuck you"?
Is that what you said? Exactly
Not - not the, not "fuck the people that work at radio"
Cause these is real people that gotta feed they kids
And they not being allowed to play that real shit
Cause they think, in order to feed they kids
They gotta play the same shit over and over and over
I was raised by KRS-One
I was raised by A Tribe Called Quest
I was raised by DMX
The last real nigga alive?
Nah, nigga, it's still real niggas alive!
We alive tonight, bruh!
Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bruh
ASAP Nast is alive tonight, bruh
Bari is alive tonight, bruh
Ian Connor is alive tonight, bruh

Ayy, y'all at my show
When I say these names, y'all better scream for me
I don't give a fuck if you know these names or not
Go head, Google 'em!
They will give you a little bit of factual information
They will give you that
Why did I name ASAP? Cause that's the future!
That's the niggas that got me and Cudi on our toes like that
These these niggas keeping this shit alive, bro
It's life, we got a hundred years down here
A hundred years on this planet, bro
And we can have a utopia
We can love each other
But the rules gotta be fair
And everybody - is it just me
Or did you hear that song so many times
"You say you wanna play for free"
Ayy, ayy, you know what it is, though?
Cause ayy, I love Drake! I love Khaled!
They set that song up, bro!
And let me tell you something!
MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always!
I'm on my Trump shit tonight!
Let me tell you what it is, bruh
Ayy, you know me
I went down 7 years of my life of motherfuckas hating me
Cause I said Beyonce had the best video
Ayy baby, it's rock and roll tonight
Y'all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit but the vibes is back
The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned!
The vibes is back
I know there's gonna be a lot of conversations after tonight
Khaled, I love you, I know you got killers in Miami
Please do not send 'em at my head
I just wanna have a conversation about how we playing radio's gaming
Khaled, you a real nigga
Khaled, you a real nigga, you got the keys
But as we learned, all them politics that niggas was doing for years
Obama couldn't make America great, cause he couldn't be him
To be who he was
Black men have been slaves

And still win, he had to be perfect!
But being perfect don't always change shit, bro
Being perfect don't always change shit, bro
So when I talk about MTV, let me explain something
I was hurt, Beyonce, I was hurt
Because I wanted to present a video called "Fade"
And outta respect MTV told me
"Mr. West, out of respect to you, I will let you know
That Beyonce is winning the video tonight for "Formation"
Over "Hotline Bling", and "Famous"
They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage
Ayy bro, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me
But you know I got the vision
And you know Imma keep it real witchu
Beyonce, I was hurt
I went down 7 years on behalf of yo -

Ayy nigga, don't throw no shit while I'm talking
I am putting my career, my life, my public-well-standing
At risk when I talk to y'all like this
This is a moment in The Matrix, bro
The vibes is back, mofuckas might feel a way about this tonight
Cause I heard that you said you wouldn't perform
Unless you won Video of the Year over me, and over "Hotline Bling"
In my opinion - now don't go tryna diss Beyonce
She is great, Taylor Swift is great
We are all great people
We are all equal
But sometimes we be playing the politics too much
And forgetting who we are
Just to win, fuck winning!
Fuck looking cool!
Fuck being cool!
Fuck all that, brah!
I been sent here to give y'all my truth, even at the risk of my own life
Even at the risk of my own success
My own career
I've been sent here to give y'all the truth
Jay Z, call me brah!
You still ain't call me!
Jay Z, call me!
Ayy brah, Jay Z I know you got killas
Please don't send 'em at my head!
Just call me!
Talk to me like a man!
I'm not tryna be "the man" - I just am "a man"
The same as everybody here
I ain't above, below - none of y'all
We all equal! We all equal!
These is the vibes, bro!
This is the future
This is the way of thinking, to Make America Great Again

You like that, guess what?! Guess what?!
Y'all need the vibes
I was hurt, feelings matter, bro
The way mofuckas put money up, so high
Popularity, radio spins
Feelings matter, bro
It's a new world, Hillary Clinton!
It's a new world, feelings matter!
Cause guess what?!
Everybody in middle America felt a way
And they showed you how they felt
Feelings matter, bro. It's a new world!
It's a new world, Barack!
It's a new world, Jay Z!
Ayy, don't send killas at my head, bro!
This ain't the Malcolm X movie!
We growin' from that moment
Let Ye be Ye!
Oh wait a second, do y'all agree with that?
Wait a second - I didn't hear no screams on that

People, I'm not saying this out of my own well-being
Cause it wouldn't be smart outta my own well-being to say things like this
Radio, I done talk to you a bunch of motherfucking times
Y'all motherfuckas is behind the times
The Saint Pablo Tour is the most relevant shit happening
The Saint Pablo Tour more relevant than radio!
And if y'all still keep following old models
Yo asses gonna get Hillary Clinton'd
You might not like it but they've gotta hear it
I ain't here to massage you with the fake truth
Telling you that Hillary gon win over and over and over
Then you wake up, you still can't believe it!
You know why? Cause you was lied to by Google!
You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!
Mark Zuckerberg you wanna call me, now?
You ain't got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?!
Was you wrong when I said I was 53 million dollars in debt and you didn't call me?!
Was you wrong?!
You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have dinner with me
I told you about DONDA
You said you would help, and you didn't!
Then you went to look for aliens
Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro!
The vibes is back!

Ayy John - take, take me all the way back to
Take me all the way back to the thing

Shia Labeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way, give him a call
Q-Tip, I love you bro, don't tell me how to be me though
I love you, the Tribe album is dope
I love you, don't tell me how to be me though
I've been me, I am me

There's a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch
About people coming into power and not changing anything
Just becoming part of the power
That's happened with musicians, cause they scared
I'm not scared; I'm here to change things
I am here to change things
And things won't change until people admit they own falsehoods
I've got the vision, bro
That is what I've been blessed with, my vision
I'm not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way
But Imma say how I feel
Right now, I will prepare
Right now, press
Get ready to write yo passive aggressive
Lebron James racist comments
Season 4, racist comments
Get ready to have a field day, press!
Get ready, get ready!
Cause the show's over

I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin? Down to get topless, ohh
I need to know, if you about cutting
Or you about frontin, baby I need to know

I spent my last 8 checks's on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shiit
She wanna sip up on the cris-e-cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister innn
That white benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon lie they only fives but together they ten's
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
It's like old folks pissin cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producing
The track that got you movin, this track got you movin
So crazy you don't know what you doin
You been telling them jokes, and its not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fo I pay for this room cuz

Now if you got it you got it
And if you don't then you prolly won't
Sissy niggas call 'em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse 'em
By 'em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose 'em
Take 'em back to confuse 'em
So she don't know if she coming or going
Cuz mami after I'm cumming I'm going
Back to show just frontin and flowin
Jewelry stuntin and glowin, this life is something I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
Cuz my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin you
After that it's over boo, baby grab your coat and VOOM

Now there's three different levels to relationships
Polly'n at the club wit em, talking getting affectionate
Leavin and havin sex with em, kickin them out
Trickin on models, dimes and rats, now I don't get into that
I kick that habit, I just, keep 'em impressed
Let 'em seat in the Lex, never, eat 'em unless
That fuckin cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin
I got a nine in my pants and baby I'm just dyin for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck? Off the sizzurp
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She prolly look good but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

Hmmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
FYI I haven't smoked not one ounce of weed today
Yeah I  figured that out

People talk shit about me, deep down they knowin' they ain't right
Hmmm, when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
When I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
People talk shit about me and they know that I know
And they also know that they ain't right
Cause when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes

I be laughin' at you niggas, tauntin' you niggas
Who the winner of this shit?
Surrounded by fake niggas and fake bitches tryna get in my ear
What about gold diggers? Yeah all them
You tryna get them some gig
Give me coochie from the Gooch
Set your sights too low
Hah, you could have had you some lean
I got some one, na, na
I ain't never met a bitch, ain't a bitch that ain't need 10 G's
Hah, I ain't never met a fool full of somethin' that ain't out for me
Well I know, oh, na, na
One day you'll say, one day you'll see me

People talk shit about me deep down they know that I know

Rejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program
Prada calf's, black skinnies, T and hoody
Y'all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin' I'm in LA
Soaking up the sun and I'm laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it's all because my God above me
But damn I'm feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain't stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin' my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don't like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don't give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I'm elevated
No drank, no tree and I'm levitated
I got my own empire, I'm the baby
I ain't taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I'm winnin' livin' life, skippin' grinnin' on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin' house
Been chill for a minute quiet as a mouse
Now I got the juice, call me Bishop when you see me round
I be showin' love, showin' love baby, dap and pound

People keep talking
They can say what they like
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright
No one but I'm nombre uno
Hey hombre I'm "Ye" so you too low
Money felt like sumo's so haters just gonna sue mo'
What you think gonna happen when they see me in that two do'
She gonna be with you she gonna see me she read' to go
Cause you have re-freshened me I'm fresh head to toe
So let's go let's get let's get it hey
I know you need something different trying to get away
I use that as a segue
Let's hit a spot where they only speak Reggae
Like no one can do it this long
She said "Aye Kan', who you tryin' to be, Akon?"
Sorry the drink had me wildin' a little bit
But my link had me stylin' a little bit
I think I'm gonna hit the island in a bit
But what I said had you smiling didn't it
She laughed at this
But after this
You know I gotta take that off
Young Halle told me "make me feel good"
So I gave her the Monster Balls

I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I'm telling you that

Lot of people askin' 'bout the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match the Neptunes, check
By check if "H to the Izzo" is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
For the millionth time askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like you don't care about my son's feelings?
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard "Takeover", who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6?
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mill, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment
Bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!

'04, College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Smashing the game, nigga, unlike you
'Cause these beats change the game and the hook's right too
I'm a crook like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do?
Knowing I supposed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child
'Bout to be on Oprah now
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice on the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit resumes is two pages
For them niggas who played us
Feet just raises, booming like Master Aces
"Stand Up", number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
Chi-Town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!

Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class so I had to cop the baby mama Benz, Jeep
With put fifty I get this on the first tape but that fifty that break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim, had a girl nicknamed Sprewell
'Cause when I try to stop, she still made me spin
Back when '80s was in, my dog Crazy Ken had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dancefloor, you crazy again
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said, "This car real old," I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
I'mma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside

Now I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"

To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace, please
What I gotta win five Grammys before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys?
If I can't bone, I'll get a clone
Get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She bobbing, don't stop her there
Told me that she love the Roc so much
She drove all the way to Far Rockaway for Roc-a-wear
More popular, cause I abracadabra my Nissan
To a car throwing a peace sign, peace
Damn, that's like the same line I used in the first verse
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait, it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew see K
And if CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
I'm tryna find a crazy female with a cutie face
A big pimper on the DL, like UGK
And then I told her

I've been hustling my whole life

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayyyyy
Oh-oh, oh-ohhhh

Girl I'ma put you to bed, to bed, to bed

I'm staring at you while you sleep, irreplaceable beauty
Take you into my senses, wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, it's a round two
Matter of fact, it's closer to three
She like, "How long I been sleep?"
Shawty kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Girl give it to me
And I can feel her turn weak
"My angel, this is wonderful"
Thanks for lettin' me bless ya
Come down, fly right
Drift back into heaven

But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend

I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P
Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend

Look for me

No one wants to fall out of heaven
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

Fall back in the pussy like swoosh, swoosh, swoosh
Ballin' money woos, woos, woos

Dog, I'm about to get loose, loose, loose
All night tryna dutty wine
Woke up my dick crooked as the Nike sign
Pop's when you had me on
I could

And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever

She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
And I just can't seem to get that nigga broke
And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but
And if you ever don't than get at me, at me
We be ballin' like the athletes
The shoes you were wearing were so last week

What are we chasing?
It feels like we're changing
Those on clouds
Learn to debate YAH
Ain't no love in the playground
Go away!
Chained to the bounce now
That's a long way

Nothing that I can do to unbreak your heart
I'm just doing my part
And I try my best not to bring it up
Just look the other way
Used to live in wonder
You were struck and now your love feels like thunder
Thunder

You can see through the veil

Y'all take the pianos an octave down. Yo, take away the "ha, ha, ha." No "ha, ha, ha." Take that shit

Runaway, did I make you runaway? Did I make you runaway?
How many people came with the one they love tonight?

You know love ain't always gon' be easy
Especially when people in your business like the way they do Yeezy
And ladies? I know you girls gon' be
Always talk 'bout what he did
Fellas? I know you guys
Always talk 'bout what she did

If I told you I can make the way to heaven tonight
And you always find, yeah you always find
If I told you I won every single bill 'bout you every minute I had to
Don't listen to me cause I'm an asshole
And you always found and the one place I fucked up
I thought you'd always be mine, I thought you'd always be mine
I thought you'd always be mine and if I say I didn't love you, I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying

So do me a favor

Remind me again why we in this shit
Can you remind me again why we in this shit?

I know it's for more than to just get rich
Since when was making music about getting rich?
Since when was making art about getting rich?
And I know it's easy for me to say cause
Having money's not anything and not having it is

Remind me again why the Grammys couldn't suck my dick

Remind me again who's the original Superfly -
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fuckin' with that "Suit and Tie."

Remind me again
Remind me again why we in this shit -
Every nigga tryin' get rich
Every rapper tryin' get rich
And every rapper rap about fuckin' somebody else... bitch

Remind me why we in this shit -
And why the Grammys can suck my dick, suck my big, black dick

And every motherfuckin' sponsor, shit
They try to put their logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet-and-greet, and you gotta meet the execs and their daughter
And they'll show you what they just bought her

Remind again why we in this shit -
They say either you comin' on too strong in this shit -
They always talkin' 'bout what I'm doing wrong in this shit
Well I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING, DICK
I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING DICK!
I lost my motherfuckin' mama
So I could give a fuck about your comments
I promise
Cause we all gonna die one day
BUT I'MMA LIVE MY LIFE MY WAY!

Remind me why we in this shit? Please? can I sell a drink for you please?
So you can help me put on a better show, Please? Corporations?

Nigga I'mma make my music from my heart, and I live and I die by
Everything that I say and everything that I do
And everything that I make is what I believe to be true
And if that shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense
I don't give a fuck - cause that was my stream of conscience
And that's the way I felt at that time
And feelings was the only facts
And Racism and materialism is killing blacks
And one more thing, if I can ask -
One more thing if I can ask -
Cause in this life our life just moves too fast
And time is something you will never get back
What's your quality of life?
And that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight
I hope you have a good time tonight...

Beat each other and
Eat each other
And maybe come together and try to teach each other and
Reach each other and
Maybe try to come together and love each other
Love each other and
Love one another, man
The way you love your mother, man
The way you should love her, man

Y'already understand
Cause this is our shit
And this is our clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than MY MOTHERFUCKIN' CLIQUE!

Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life

You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, money's one that I not have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
All my niggas about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Now hold up
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
I told dude "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
Yamamoto Adidas is sick with the fashion
Y'all already got dough so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fiends

Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
Let the beat ride out for a minute

Let's take it there, take it there man

How many niggas you know that put their life on the line to get signed?
Did a few high crimes, almost had lights out
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I might doubt, just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressin'
When I copped them pounds it was my best investments
Dre got shot and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Last like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is clashin'
You ain't got no muscles you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, NAW, your hair sucks
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah
And offers to sell and yell, uh

Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-A-Fella is fo' life

For my southside niggas that know me best
I feel like Taylor Swift still owe me sex
For my Chitown niggas that know me best
Why? I made that bitch famous
All I do is get tattoos and read French Vague
Every bitch in the spot wanna drink my Ragu

And did you know that the country, Switzerland
It was famous for lakes?
And I think I got my ring from there 'cause it's icy like skates
Nigga, icy like hockey
Cold like a dead body, yeah

I've loved you better than your own kin did

Nike slave, fit in your place
Don't come out your face
Don't come out your mouth
Don't come out your house
Don't come out the blah
It came out the North, it came out the South
The tally is down
Bumpin' the...
The hate is anony...
The copacabana...
It made me...
Someone told me...
The world turnin' Black slowly
Where you can call niggas "niggas"
But you better not mention Hitler
So tell me who run the label, where the guns from? Us
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us

Free like a bird
Know what I'm sayin'?

One more time for the Chi-Town
One more time for the A-Town
I bet that money come around if you stay down
I swear, I just came from Europe, my money colored like a clown
Nigga play with keys, Swizz Beatz
Nigga only fuck unique freaks
Came up out a hot boy, fuck a baller blocker
Bitches makin' lots of noise like Griselda Blanco
Lick the molly off my hand
Smokin' loud, ambulance
And I was high as hell, I need to come down
Somebody call Tar, I need a Xan
Eat that pussy like a jelly bean
Got a mink on like I'm Hakeem
Got fish filet but we don't fry these
Gold card with a Trojan
Rub the bitch with the lotion
Bitch I'm ballin' like Kobe
Bitch I'm ballin' like LeBron
No, no, we don't broadcast
Pussy nigga gotta show
Monkey nigga actin' like they don't know me
But a lot of monkey niggas owe me

Ayo dog
Nicky my dog
And this is for sure
So I'm not going to break you down
Ask Christina Millian know what we did on tour
Stays on tour, and i'll tell you right now
And I like Indian girls, but I won't hurry
Last time we boned, you had the bedroom smelling like curry

Come on boss
You were suppose to be the Pimp and Prince
I've seen you in Friday after next
And I haven't seen you since

Look it's hard for me to say shit
Cause I don't know about that gay shit
But I see you do, looking like Tiger Woods
Like lost in the hood
Looking like Bryant Gumbel
And expect me to be humble
Every time I flip a fold your goin to crumble
With them phony ass pony's
Bitch read the news
Why you always try running in the back and grab all the free shoes
So Why don't you buy somethin' ?
Why don't you try somethin' ?
Stop lying, stop fronting
Y'all niggas don't know about nothing

I could rip all of yall
In a line
With every rhyme
Yall know Kanye, is like the greatest all time
'Cause I do the Grammys, and comeback with my family
Rippin' you muthafuckers
With the mic that you hand me
You all don't understand me dawg
You still pushing camrys
Please, step back for a minute
You the Lieutenant, I'm the General
And generality killing yall
And Yeah, and I could keep it right there
Kanye ripping you niggas
This shit is unfair!

Don't talk
I appreciate it
I appreciate 'at
But don't talk
I don't want

That's fine
To me
I don't want to hear paparazzi talk to me
Or anybody I know
No no
At all
And don't talk to anyone I know
And tell everybody never talk
To anyone
That anyone knows.
Don't talk to themselves
Don't talk ever again

Yo, I said don't
I said don't talk!

Yo, it's Kanye To The
I did this beat in '96 and ah...

Is it the because my beats the nicest
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold cause I got the gold and kept my soul
Drop an album full of soul
Sold twelve times gold that's six plat
Man that's a sick plaque
Man don't forget that at the top is where you feel the loneliness
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear I feel the phoniest
Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
Cause everybody wants your spot
No I.D. told me this
Oh I seen homies get
Shysty on me quick
Wooooh, just imagine if I only spit?
But I do beats too, that's the American dream
Stack two, make sure my shorties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments
Got niggas sayin', "There's the Kennedys"
But oh yes it's, the Wests
Brand new Roc-A-Fella most fresh to death is
Definitely Kanye, peace to Sportie LA
That keep my shoe game early like the grave shift
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit?
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics
Air Force, check
Rolex, check
Call Gee and Hop, did you get the, check?
Roc-a-Fella piece, check
Don't forget the neck
Is it the money on deck
That keeps on the honeys on the dick?
Now that ain't really rhyme
But I ain't really tryin'
Till I pluraled my math
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have
Date ballplayer's wives, that divorce and got half
Shit, I figure they deserve somethin' for all them hours
And that be the realest shit I never wrote
Only book I ever read I could have wrote
48 Laws Of Power
Me, Gee and Hop, uh huh, the game's ours
Cause on the real son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuckin' smoke
If you paid, then she's thinkin' bout her children
Feel him? probably not though, unless you got dough
You know what I mean?
You will think the grass greener when you finally get green
I told Gina, you ain't been in a Medina
Yeah, I seen you grabbin' on my balls like Serena
Yeah, y'all the invisible ho, you ain't never seen her
Um huh, she must stay around your grandma's crib
Right next door to where the in-laws live
I brought a man from the fifth floor
All in y'all crib

Remember niggas back at school, they didn't have no girl at school
So they be like, "I got a girl she just stay by my grandma's crib." Hehe
Yo, Dame, where the fuck you find me?
Hahaha

So now ladies and gentlemen this is star time
Are you ready for star time?

Life of the rich and gorgeous
Someone gonna be forging it
I told my dad I would have been aborted
If I wasn't the one that put the cord in
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
Now I get the order
Thumbing thumbing through my wallet
Automatic toilet, now that's the shit
Popping off with the orbit, I got ya bitch
Let it go

God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
Don't you play no

Let me fix my neck, chain on
Let me fix the check, games on
Let me thump a thump game on
And ain't nobody playing with him no
Summertime rain with him no
They all layin' with him now
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
No one wanna pray with him no
Want it done bathe in it now
Wanna get a raise with him now
Something down in nah-ney with em now
Like we always
Talk to me like we always
The illuminati
Dirt Bike or a Kawasaki
Bottle up on a new party

God dammit
Don't you play with you

Oh you been
Something I can you bitch
Only one and they don't forget
Yeah I walk
Pop sampling
Hold on
Fall out all about
What y'all about

With your praying hands
For you lil' niggas I'm way advanced
And I don't write rhymes, I write tattoos
And when I die they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
Till they run up on a bad mood
Bitch that's a bad move
Bitch get out the way
Someone gonna get out today
And I know I was gone for a minute
But need to get out today
Now let us get this money

Don't play boy
Hoppin in the mansion
Waking around with a robe on
I could have started play boy
Cause I married a playmate
When you stay eight
And they rate
I kinda want the nudes
Something for when I'm in that mood

I got 'em
Young Carter on the A-team if it's in alphabetical order
Used to daydream about Benzes and Porches
And by 18, I had a Benz and a Porche
I'm so used to stuntin' on y'all
So tired of ballin', excuse me if I yawn
But I know what I'm doing
Out the window of the jet, you see L.A. like a Bruin
New coupe, foot to the floor
Weather man make it rain, turn sugar to snow, you know
But watch how you speak
Cause in the street you can't trust every smile you meet
And you ain't as important as the new addition is
Ralph Tresvant, ooh they so sensitive
And it's the remix baby
And I'm a knock it out like Felix baby
God damn I'm fly
And my troop so cool, I don't have to lie
Hop in my car and go Kanye West
With my groovy new Louis Vuitton damier vest
Let 'em hate though
I'm on my way to the bank, LMAO

It's one of the best to touch microphones
That'll spit the kind of shit to put the earth in a type of zone, like
To make 'em laugh or make 'em cry
Bring a life into existence or cause you to die
Now when I was a shorty and when my mom called me precious
I realized I'm outspoken and every word was infectious
I'm sayin', Mommy said God'll bless us
No matter the difficulties or how much it would stress us
I'm sayin', no matter how hard I try
To understand if I behave that I'll see God when I die, man
These words'll dawn on me, why?
Cause no one came back from death to say if it's truth or it's lies
See the point that I'm makin' is that she knew I was blessed
And comin' to life as a legend, the man of best in the flesh
I kiss my mother, countin' figures
Thinkin 'back on when I used to tell niggas, they sayin'

If I always pray to have gleam on
And I was high as a Learjet
And it don't matter if I get her number
Cause when I get my money right she gon' come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "O"
Damn Ye, would you change anything?
I'd cop more pink polos and pop those collars
"Wait 'til  get my money," everybody motto
Yeah, hey mama they can't hate him

I'm out here fighting for y'all! Creatives. Artists. Independent thinkers.

Don't never mention my name! In a bad manner!

None of y'all!

Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style
Told 'em from my grandchildren, put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas can't see me so cease the hard looks
I'll rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop, my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Verbally killin', my style is ready to willin'
Y'all niggas stay back chillin'
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me, what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so I rode the train
Before I got here, spawned here
I'm 'bout to save this shit, yo it's my year, what!?
Bring it on, pass it to my man Tariq
Rock the mic all week

It's Kanye West straight outta Chi-Town
Super producer brought you joints like
H to the Izzo, Takeover and that new Scarface single
And I'm chillin with the leader of the new school
Absolute heavy hitters y'all

Yo...
I'm Kanye To The, first of all coming straight from the Chi
Uh, I don't lie
It's like the singer say
I've been known to do beats like that, know what I'm saying
Brought you hits such as
Uh, Uh
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Gimme some brain before I hop up on this plane
Gotta head right back to the Chi

Now even though I went to college and dropped outta school quick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time only
Two way or phone me, if you tryna bone me
Yo man got money, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinneded Nia, dark skinneded Tamia
Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out that's why I barely hear ya
It be going in and out like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like Rob and G-Dep
And I'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it gets so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still

K-A-N-Y-E, Chi-Town playa out in NYC
She said she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans cuz the ass is free

I love girls, girls, I got a fetish for em
But not no lettuce for em
Dick and bad credit for em
Bills, bills, I know she tryna get paid
She know I'm tryna get laid
She figure that's an even trade off
If she a stewardess I show her to my cockpit
If she a lawyer then I give her Johnnie Cochran
If she wanna see me again
She better get 2 friends then maybe then
We'll have group sex, toothex
And a young girl off that X
And she just turned eight-teen
Last week she was against the law
So for her birthday I put this dick against her jaw
And like a picture in a frame put it against the wall
Said she had never been with a man before
But she not a virgin, huh, she a lady lover
I didn't know y'all take each other out and date each other
But that's a lady lover
I ain't even know that was ya baby mother

Explain the outro man, don't nobody never get to the outro
I just take a whole record and just
I'm not gonna talk about the producer shit right now
I just want niggas to realize my shit, you know what I'm saying
2002, aight
I sounded real mad on the last mixtape
I'm not even gonna go there this time, ok

You say what is it that you want?
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
I got a bureau full of diamonds
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
And let me rap to you

You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lot of clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and "Do she need that beat tracked again?"

'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on Chyna Doll, I woulda did them beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' me
I bought some earrings like, "Baby, that may be fake"
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can get a menage with Lazy K
And Lady May, maybe, hey?
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh, Trina?
Oh, I'm right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to-
I ain't finish that verse

When I'm far away from you my baby
I know it's hard for you my baby
Because it's hard for me my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love

Get Right For The Summer workout tape
You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out

My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS..

STOP! IT'S THA MUTHAFUCKIN' REMIX!!

B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day, every day fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that's for the A-Town
What y'all sayin'?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna stand and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers

And like now I shop every day on Rodeo drive
I just want to say, thank you Kanye! woooo! woooo! woooo!

That ever since listenin' to Kanye's workout tape
And what's most importantly is that I ain't gotta fuck Ray Ray's

And I just want to say since listenin' to Kanye's workout tape
And I row the plain, row the plain, row the plain

And I don't gotta work at the mall again

*Beat changes*

That's right put in work, move your ass, go wizzerk
Get your salad, no dessert

That's right put in work
Move your ass, go wizzerk

Woah yeah

Would you like to ride?
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Ooh you so bougie boo you could have fooled me
'Cause five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Rob and G. Dep
Then I'mma take you to the house like Trick and Trina

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away

Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle 'dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you
Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to

Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife
Stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor
The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways goin' Wild West like Kanye
Wherever I lay my ??? is my home, goddamnit I'm grown
Broke broad I'mma leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

Don't let them make you believe
That I'm crazy, that I'm crazy

I think it's a couple more things they owe us
Billions and cars and weed
And mothafuckin' minks is all that they show us
But we are the owners

So don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
That I'm crazy, nigga I'm not crazy
I'm tellin' you

See that's the magic of racism, it works on itself
We hate each other, screw each other, kill each other
When we can't kill nobody else
See that's the magic of lackin' resources, it works on itself
500 niggas gettin' pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-popped
And North Carolina didn't help
Niggas hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas
Hate niggas, hate niggas, ayy, niggas, ayy, nigga
And I was born in the A, nigga
And my name Ye, nigga, ayy nigga

Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't make, make you believe that I'm crazy
I'm not crazy
Don't let the media make you believe that I'm
That I'm...

See that's the shit I don't like

Heart made of stone
Hands made of hearth
Heartbroken so long
Good things don't last
Good things
You gotta
Brace for that fall
Made for this song
Made for so long

If you'd care for me my baby

Oh oh, so long
Waves so far up
Good things, good
Richer or poor
Better or worst
Last or first
Hungry or thirst
Sad things
Sad news
Good things to do
Nothing for you
What it means to you
Can't change or change you
You can't let it
You can't rearrange you
Love made of glass
Love turning cold
We had a good thing
Its good, Its good uh
We had a good thing, no no no

Niggas old as hell, trying to get they rapping on
In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
I'm in the club, posted up, "Guess Who's Back" is on
If not that then the Just Blaze track is on
It's all Roc the world, we all got your girl
Caught your girl, never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans, I'm going after MCs
Show 'em that this rap game made for me
Made for us, they bite and they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
Dog, I had to eat, I sold beats from my album
Now I got heat, I hold beats for my album
February 18th, reach for my album
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever
Black Benz, white truck, and one 2-seater
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
I got the hood on my shoulder, city on my back
They like "Damn, I heard you charging 50 a track! I mean
You can at least give me a stack
You can't do all that hard work yourself and not give nothing back!"
You know how shit change when your name get to buzzing
This year alone I got two dozen new cousins
Niggas popping out the woodworks, talking about "you owe me"
Mama, I'm famous, niggas hate me that don't know me

Yo, I know you all suprised and shit when you see me on MTV
But keep your eyes glued to...I don't know what channel that is out here
In Chicago that's Channel 7, ABC
You might fuck around see me on Oprah Winfrey or something
Matter of fact, true story, true story
Last week...I got a little cold right now, true story, though
I'm on 40th and like 5th or something
I see an SUV and the window rolled down and shit!
And this black lady from Chicago, she like
"Yo, um, I just bought one of these in black."
You know I just got the G5 or whatever
She like, "I just got one of these in black
How does it drive?"
I'm like, "it drive more like a truck than my last one."
I'm like, "yo, but I'm from Chicago, too. I wanna be on your show!"
She said "yo, well, oh, ok, well, who are you?"
And I told her, "I'm Kanye West, a rapper."

Lyrics will be available as soon as the song is released. Stay tuned!

New angels still learning how to fly
Still learning how to fly
And lay your love on the line
New angels
Who will make the sacrifice?

Forget everything that you know
You're way too far from home
Hollow sign for kingdom
And you're ready, you're ready, you're ready
Having to run the game over
Ready she ready, she ready, she ready

The new angel
New angel

Hell if I, hell if I know
Act like you've met me before
Swear that she met him before
Had a menage a trois
I'm on the road all alone
Now that she ready, she ready, she ready
Yeah she ready, ready, ready new ange-
And you knew she was
You knew it
Before you, before you, slip that motherfucker in her drink
Yeah you knew she was

They got a special place in Hell for guys like us
Guys like us, guys like us, guys like us

I don't know why niggas tripping on a nigga
For clippers, I hate you niggas too
But I'm black and Mexican, we gon' change that, haha
I hate you niggas too!

If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one
Out west, Southwest, where you fly from
New Jersey, Teterboro where I fly from
You ain't got no Ghost, you need to drive one
That bitch is so broke, try to find some
And she ain't got no money, tryna find some
I swear these bitches funny, hahaha
Hahaha, hahaha
You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah

Got a bad bitch at build-a-body
Get a bad bitch and build a body
When your pop, the slim nigga shady
When your pop was Slim, I was Baby
I came for them chips like I'm K.D
Came for them bricks like I'm Maisie
We hit up the trap which is booming
Hustle, French John Newman
Fuck making the move, we the movie
Fuck the whole group, I'm a groupie
All that money rolling through the lobby
VVS is dripping off my body
You can do what you want when you got it
Go get a bitch and then build her body
They wanted Versace Milan
We do what we want and then copy
Smack a Roley on my arm
Skrrr, middle fingers to the feds
Put a hundred dollars on your head
Price of life hit you
And all my dawgs gotta eat
And all the money get divided
Snipe game be the wildest
Get a bad bitch, build her body
Get a bad bitch, build her body, haan

Harlem to the death, I'mma forever front
A problem with the kid is what you never want
That's what you want, I had my niggas waiting for you
Like you sitting at a table in a restaurant
Slice you like pizza, I keep six in the squeezer
My jewelry is nice, dressing is iced
It's how you can sit in the freezer
Keep my dick in the diva, word, no problem licking it either
Baby girl could be a believer, we could just kick it like FIFA
All the women heavy like pallbearer
That Henney got that cake like Carvel
Carvel, me, I'mma die
Inside the pussy, man, I know just how Lamar felt
My bitch sit on me flat without no tummy tuck
She no stripper but all she do is pick money up
Five-o called me over, word to my homie, I ain't tell 'em shit
He seemed aggy, so all I did was tell him this

We can't even sit and talk, without you arguing
You're the one who started it

I got a girl at home but she don't cook
I have my condoms in the stove cause she won't look
And she never ever go to the grocery store
So I figure its safe to pull a grocery ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor isle
She said "I hope its not too ghetto"
Rocked all gold force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin wild
Like last week I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
She got a brand new car, 16
Now the car only 1 years old, oh
Man but the body look grown, whoa
Before I catch a case I better take my ass home
Where the problems is, arguments be Daly like Carson is
But the problem is..

We can't even sit and talk no more, without you arguing
Girl you must be out of your mind, no no no

Hold up, wait a second man
That's that thrift store info, that's all second hand
Why don't you talk to the mouth of the horses 'bout my Porsches
Condos in front of the golf courses
Instead you stay up, countin every second like a fake Roley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way the censorship'll go off, you know me
I ain't call you, you wanna know why?
Im in Noha, Hon aloha, pushin jet skis so I
Couldn't return the pages on my Motorola
Nextel, my cell, it don't work down there
What happened in Cancun? Stays down there
What's happenin here? Made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat, why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments

Man, boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after 2 or 3 or 4
I ain't messin with them girls no more
It's weak, the benz coupe is so sweet
When I roll down the street, tears roll down her cheek
She said, "You must love that car more than me
And nigga I was with you before the cheese
So you need to work on your pri-or-ities
If she went with Fabolous I bet that she would be
A-R-G-U-I-N-G and please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm getting spins on
W-K-R-P in Cincinnati
You think I'd get my voice so deep like
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this?

I mean wow. You know? Man

Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say "I know"
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like "Hey, you might like this"
And see
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, "Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle"

There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
Don't believe
That you can't achieve
Whatever you're after
You can't be swayed
By the simple minds
That wanna hold you down
And in his time
When you
Get with
We'll be not far behind

If you listen to the sermons
And ask the Lord for guidance
Listen to all the stories

You can do anything

I got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me
To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
But the women be callin' me
The liquor be callin' me
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams

You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true

I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Man I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, nigga you ain't up on this
That's why I'm iced out, medallion heavy on the wrist
My niggas servin' the checks like the first and fifth-teenth
So insecurr, cut that coke 'til it's so unpure
We all need furs by December the third
Cause you heard, Chicago winters is extra burr
Bricks, nicks, nigga so herb
Hustlin' to the whole world, never sober
Seats in the Rover, soft as sofurrs
Ballin so hurr 'till I need a chauffeur

Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
The concept of school seems so secure
She like, fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy shorty a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby-daddy don't really care

It may seems we living the nigga's American dream
As any means to get that green
Cause society done turned us all into fiends
And what about the teens moms hearts that broke?
Niggas got killed over Starter coats
But I can feel why the shorties be mad as shit
Without the Jordans, he feelin' inadequate
He be feelin' so insecure
Dawg, why that nigga got it? Man life unfair
He be feelin' like fuck the world and furthermore
Feelin' like it's worth
Killin' a person for
But when that pain's gone, it just hurts some more
It seems the sun never shine, that we searchin' for

Respect that

This one for my baller niggas
That hate when the weakest ho in the club try to approach him
Some songs the ladies love me
The girls gon' hate me for this one
But I gotta do it
Come on

Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me

She asked
Is that pronounced N-Y-C?
No, that's a niche
Rock Clavin Klein
So she can see K
I'm still doing 120 on the freeway
She still got a prom picture in her key-chain
I told her look
This ain't high school no more
I'm not tryin'a fuck being cool no more
So niggas go ball
Just to perform
Cause all these rats be talking up a storm
I know what they worn
I know what they be liking
If they hair short
Said "They probably be dyking'"
Probably a drying
Probably you like it
I can't know what
You're probably a psychic
I know a crazy bitch by the look in her eyes
I know a cheating bitch gonna look at my guys
I know a fat bitch gonna look at them fries
Tell me on the side like
"Can I supersize?"
Got my meat in my ride
Go down while I drive
Some hoes ain't for show
You just keep 'em inside
Call 'em at 3 AM and get deep up inside
Blow me and my homie, when you see me you don't know me
You heard?

This ain't a song I made for ugly hoes to start approaching me

Rock the jeans above the knees
Oh them must be some kid capris
So I spend cheese
Urp!
Bitch please
Your girlfriend ain't tell you 'bout me
Kanye fuck 'em and leave 'em
Act like he don't need 'em
See titties and squeeze 'em
For no fucking reason
"Ugh, he's so classless grabbing asses
How would you do a nerd bitch with glasses"?
Pimp nigga never spent no dough on a booty
I wish I would take this fat hoe to the movies
Them niggas must not know the price of the Coogi
I'ma little too rich to fuck this broke bitch
Kanye more important than Michael Jordan
Got this rap game locked, you could call the warden
Give hoes cock then I'm gone by morning

Damn I was wrong..how could I stoop so low?
Pull up in a four door volvo
Dropped the top and swooped yo hoe
Woah..oh no
I don't want no wild body bitch in my wild body 6
No fucking weak hoes in my fucking Regal
No bitch that's whack in my Cadillac
No bitch with a fade in my Escalade
No sluts with a gut in my Beamer truck
No ? in my gold Jaguar
"I never thought Kanye would take it this far!"

Remember back in high school?
Like prom queen, right?
She was like 37-25-36
Now she 37 with 25 kids
Ya' know what I'm sayin?
Now she on the come up
Tryna get a baller nigga
Bitch heard my song on the radio
She heard me on the Jagged Edge shit
Memorized my cell phone number out the blue
Called me on some..
"I wasn't sure if that was you or not"
Bitch you ain't hear me say Kanye Titter at the beginning?
Gold digging bitch

Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long man, we back in town

Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So when your hooker choose Cons, she telling you "Bye"
Street poetry is how your boy get paid
In that brand new Escalade, metallic, black or beige
And when I walk up in the club, you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy, he got something to say

Aiyyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
Where the Glocks don't jam, so when we pop, them scrams
See I showed you on "The Champions" how we get down
So don't twist your lips up like Bobby Brown
You got B2K all on your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan', I'm gonna work your walls
Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats

And if you talk about him, aiyyo I take you out
Either with the nine, or the Tec's in his mouth
And if that dime getting friendly then the orgy's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine, so you couldn't relate

So relax yourself, or we'll back you down

Quence was out the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You staring at my rose gold way too long
But I ain't scared to ride, that's why I wear Teflon
I took her on the ave' and she expect me to trip
But I made her window shop while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama, holler at your boy

Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
They say "he don't look like a thug or a hood"
"But he keep them gorilla's, so he still be good"
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
And the N-Y-E, out N.Y.C
I'mma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they raps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'mma milk the game, 'til we all can eat

Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zoning for a couple of weeks

Now your momma told you let the cleavage show
'Cause that's the best way, to get a nigga with dough
They'll fake a pregnancy, and call the attorney up
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture

Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and the Puffs from L.B
They know that Consequence be wearing gold and ice
Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Eh shorty, let me tell you 'bout the rules of my nights
It seems I always keep it moving, I don't hit nothing twice

In the night I hear 'em talk

Life is like a long love song so I vibe
Yellow brick road on 24's as I ride
Shorty is a winner, when I'm in her I get lost
Make her tremble like the middle of December on the frost
UGG boots in a coupe dual exhaust
As I fall deep in love, Mr. West check my pulse
Paintings on the wall, Basquiat is her favorite
Black Maybach way trilla than a slave ship
How can I not spazz, questions that I'm asked
Home owner at nineteen, yo I done learned fast
My first love cheated on me, she was heartless
She fucked the quarterback and seperated partners
I took my quarter back and played another cartridge
I took my locket back and threw it in the garbage
I sang a melody, it sounded nice as T-Pain's
Okay I'm playing follow me, just to peep game
We party hard and fall asleep on the airplane
If she flirty in the dirty, then she fair game
Checkerboard luggage as they holler all aboard!
Portishead in the iPod until I reach a snore
In the clouds of the lear, thinking of Shakir
Run the game like my nigga still was here
In the clouds of the lear thinking of Shakir
We run the game like my nigga here, Baous

I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
You wait a couple of months, then you gonna see

Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know bout me and you

Plain Pat, what up?

I've always been the same since back in the day
Always felt like we should get paid
To be on magazines or we get played
Why did he say it? I don't know, ask Gabe
Now I'm on the magazines where the roses are
Poppin' champagne and that Rose Don
Won a few awards then we went on tour
And yup in my bag a whole bag of porn
Magazines hate him, then they love him
Now I'm on my way up
Now you want me say what? Huh, you want me say what?
I be talking my shit so I guess I'm an asshole
They be kick and pushin' like Lu Fiasco
And I guess every time I'm just gon' get in that mode
Suck up to the press, I guess I miss that vote
I did an interview with The Rolling Stones
Read the interview, man the whole shit wrong
Far as this shit go, you know the way I wanna glow
I need Al Gore to recount that vote
You know you know you know, you know
You think that you know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but I'm right here
And I'm gon' be the same my whole career, yeah
I'm gon' stay the same my whole career, you know?

Run the next song.

And we a li'l late wit' the Christmas gifts
Got a surprise for you that ain't on your Christmas list-es
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said "It's D-ricious"

First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y'all
For Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs
I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph
Thugs think I'm a Blood 'cause I won't take this red suit off
Ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe
I let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the North Pole
Her voice slow 'cause "I always got a sore throat"
Okay, stop it, no more jokes
You never see me 'cause I shop when the stores close
And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go
Ha, I got nine reindeers
That's Dancer, that's Prancer on the fourth flo'
That's Comet, that's Cupid, that's Vixen
That's Donner, that's Dasher, that's Blitzen
Happy Kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren't Christian
Everybody gets gifts as long as I'm livin'
So look forward to havin'

All of the flashin' light
If you like what you see me

I peeped it, you know what?
Need some reindeer for this one
I wanna hear sleigh bells on this one
Got a new suit on this one
The newborn look too cute for this one
Yeah, the new winter coat for this one
Yeah, gotta let it snow on this one
Huh, all the Christmas cheer for this one
The whole family up in here on this one

And you know one thing that's great about that problem
That it's not my problem
That's on you bitch
That's on you
You know one thing that's great about that problem
The fact that that's not my problem
Is that the fact that it's not my problem
Who knew

I'm a owner and a consumer
Thumper larger than uma nigga
Fucks with all the rumors
I need 40 acres and it's 2 less
Oh I need 40 acres and a girl that got a mule ass
I fucked three white girls this evening
Toughen up when I'm overdone
Fucked three white girls this evening
Martin Luther King be proud of it cause I overcome
Got that one out
Got that one off
Bumping off to tell a nigga something

Want to know one thing about that problem
The fact its not my problem

Now 4 dose I'm overdosing
I own the remote in the old sofa
Thump-a-dump-a-dee-dump
Bumping a nigga then I need to know
Gotta di-di-di-di-do eat it though
Niggas be all on when they need ya
Numma numma all on when they need ya
Then they forget to repay you
I call that shit nigga-nesia
This right here this is a speed bump
We goin up when the knee jump
I'mma go pump for a knee jerk
Motherfuckers working like they need work

The only good thing about that problem
It really ain't my problem

Where y'all niggas at?
What's up nigga

"I don't care if someone's the president or not," Kanye finished. "I care about thoughts and how you helping people and what you bring to the world."

Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good, so good

And we back
Feeling better than ever, huh?
Yo John, can't complain, huh?
Shit nigga, you got a deal on Def Jam
Got Cons' with me, we in the works
Got my best friend GLC, the Knockout King
Through the doctor's exact calculations
He said, "Nigga, you almost bust the Final Destination
Shit, you must have had a blessing from Pastor Mason"
'Cause that trip to L.A. could have been my last vacation, what?
I mean, there's people at war right now
We can't be sitting up here, complaining about the bills
Complaining about whatever beef we may have
We good, man, we blessed

Lately, I been fucking thin broads
Who pussy get wet off in the winter
Yeezy season girls so bad
Might pull my dick out and fuck the whole cast
I'm menage-in' at the garden
Pussy juice on my beard, James Harden
I'm the meanest don that I walk in
I'm the realest coming out of Harlem
Might pull up with Louis Farrakhan
In a Bentley coupe blacker than Akon
Might hit the club with The Nation
If I make it rain it take a day long
Might fuck your bitch on vacation
New Gosha all my clothes A1
I'm the reincarnated Trayvon
With a big hoodie that zip up to my face, gone
Sway I got all the answers
Yams, Is chilling with my grandma
They can have it with Donda
R.I.P to Ye mama
Why they crucify Cosby?
Why they scrutinize my peeps?
Blew the noises off my sphinx
Why they keep fucking with Yasiin?
Why they break all of our leaders?
To make us all non-believers
To make us all non-believers?
This ain't up for no reason
They try to fuck up our image
They think we dumb, they not seeing it
The news is bull, I ain't reading it
Hood Pope, I'm the new Jesus
I'm the new Jesus

I tell a bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan
Then I take you out the dirt and turn it into sand
Just trust in what I'm saying, and quit...
Quit asking what's gotten into me
You don't need a nigga with them tender tendencies
I think you need a lil' more Hennessy
Fuck your man, I'll be your sensei
I could teach you how to keep the rent paid
Got the schedule boomin', I mean poppin' poppin' to the point the phone die in mid-day
But I call you late night just to fall through
Bust a nut and then regret it like a nigga always do
But I don't I always hit you with the hit back
And if I ever fucked another bitch I pretended it was you
I admit that
Not, saying that I did that
Chill, chill, chill, take it easy, easy, don't be going all Kill Bill
Show respect to the whole squad and Yeezy Yeezy
I'ma give you everything you fucking needed

Believe it
Straight up
Whoa, whoa whoa

Day 1

Day 2

Day 3

Day 4

I told her to drive over after dude crib
Bring a couple new friends
Them last girls was too thick
How you expect me to hit?
You wanna watch Clueless
I wanna watch Foolish
Excuse me, miss, I don't appreciate your rudeness
But if you strip, I will appreciate your nudeness
I heard the best head come from girls that is toothless
Yeah my game ruthless, yeah my car ruthless
Spit that "Through The Wire" over Chaka Khan, ruthless
She said she had a friend look like Janet Jackson
That bitch came over lookin' more like Freddie Jackson
Nah, nah, nah, baby, won't be no time for no action
I'm just gon' play this "Slow Jamz," holla at your man

Old school like Melle Mel
Or we could go to the D where Drelle Drel
Or DC, PG, or ATL
Back in Chi, I mean my life like a magazine
Father penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a black tail
I'm feelin' the vibe, her body and soul
Well let's kill all the pollyin', I offer you a Cosmopolitan
Let's jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
You know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be in a robbery
P-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that
Don't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone
He said, "Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold"
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switched my girls around like 3L dub
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she's a Christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man
I'm in the club pullin' the same old two step
While Omegas doin' the same old Q step
I had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green
She a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicago win 'til Chicago wins
'Til we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one the other's gettin' away
I have to say, we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack and aye I have to say
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all, let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get your tall ass out that C-Class coupe
You see the whiskey, had them girls feelin' frisky
You was with me, she said, "Who's your sensei?"
And even if they wanna get busy
And freaky like Missy and roll some weed up
You'll roll 3 blunts and fuck up 3 blunts
Mothafucka you would fuck up a free lunch
Dawg, keep it right thurr like Chingy
Your girl don't like me? How long has she been gay?
Spanish girls ask me, "No habla ingles"
And everybody wanna run to me for their sin-glay
Dawg if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg if I was you I'd kill myself
That Ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian, that's straight up nigga
She claimed she ain't hear me on "The Bounce" with Jigga
She claimed she ain't see me on the basement with Tigga
Them both my niggas, I suppose
I might have been doin' a lil' frontin' for the hoes
When I flip flows, I rip shows
And your girlfriends, can I hit those?
I don't know if it's me, or do them Uggs
Got girl's feets lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with her name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
Cause umm... I'm tryna make it to your anus
See that's a little John Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John's name
Niggas tryna figure out since Kan' came
They said, "Woah don't get caught up in the hype"
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend moeny 'til you're broke, my nigga, live your life
Cause I'm livin' international, nigga, the American dream
All my dawgs is livin' vicariously through me
If I get head from Drene, that's one for the team
Cause 702, that's one for the crew
My dawg Hip-Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive
Cause like a Brinks truck, they know there's money inside

I'ma take a little intermission
I'ma let y'all just talk about how good I rap for a minute and I'ma come back

So I dropped out of school cause I'm tryna eff the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit her with this maneuver, he just couldn't recuper'
I'm tryna stab one like Jack The Ripper
I'm tryna stab two like Jack The Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the skreets, he gon' want him some skrippers
And I'm a big tipper, I don't even be trippin'
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em cloudin' up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper gettin' jean
4 Gs in the Rocawear jeans
This top red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see this? These are the sweetest Adidas
We fire, y'all retire
All ugly people, please be quiet
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was re-hired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
Laughs I do though...

I am not here right now; I am not home
Leave a message after the life. Flat line tone
Leave a message after the life; after I'm gone

Everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Every-everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star

Niggas reppin' the 'Go, but we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, nigga, we can't tell
You claim you got dough but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

Politics kept me at the end of the mixtapes
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
I'm trying to do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got B.I.G
'Cause I moved up out the city and got big
That's the poison, that runs through their veins and attack their soul and just start to tear 'em up
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops, they forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats himself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own

Ya'll bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas getting dough, dawg, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s on a two-for-one sale

Cop oz by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'mma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'mma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twista, The Flic' , and Do or Die
My-my my name is Kanye and not Kayne, bitch
At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with
No, none of that same shit, that new and improved
Now I don't know if it's me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
But I'm so la smooth, there's nothing to prove

You niggas 'bout blow, man, we can't tell
You niggas gettin' dough, dawg, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

Well the song says no one man should have all that power right?

There's definitively been times I let
Let power, get the best of me
And let the world take the rest of me
I look in the mirror and say
"God, is this, is this my destiny?
Is this what I've done
After all the years of you blessin' me?"
Well maybe this is just a moment
A moment of you all testin' me
To see if I can still act professionally
To keep me at bay
Like the Chesapeake
Guess it's me
Just a 'G
From the C.I.,
Honest And why?

Why would you give me that Power?
Knowing I was just an artist
Knowing exactly where my heart is
And I will only work the hardest
And sometimes, put art, before being the smartest
And sometimes act retarded
Just look at what I started
And they wanted me to be dearly departed
Die, nigga die, and I had no reply
And I still looked her in the eyes
And said that I could touch the sky
And after all the drama
I wonder where I would be if I still
Had my Momma, Common
And everybody I was promising around me
You know how niggas from Chi town be, sometimes we wild

Act like a child
Get fouled
Stay in style
As of now ?
... flows through the veins of a modern day
Pharaoh. In American Apparel
Standing down the barrel of the media
For the man that face never made it in the encyclopedia
His story, His glory
and they re-write history right in front of us - in front of us
But what happens?
When one of us is on the other side of that T.V. screen?
You know what I'm sayin'. Real niggas you know what I mean
- you know what I mean

Or at least that's what I thought
But when they sayin' "Hey that's what the real nigga do, right?"
Naw not right, that's just mean, that's just me that's not, right
Now how long did it take me to realize?
And open up my fucking eyes!
That this shit is just a disguise
All the fame!
And the power!
And the hour!
In the showers!
Of the diamonds!
And the jewels!
And the gold!
Everybody say you cold!
Everybody screaming at motha ****ing shows
And you know what?

You wake up in the morning
And in awe you're a real person
And worse you got the ?...
Got a little bit harder
A little bit more insignificant
You was the terrific ****
Buying expensive ****
Last year worked for Louis or Ford
Too much for me to even record
The only thing I had to do was get my heart out
The greatest blessing in the world is the fact you let me get my art out
The fact that you accepted me and didn't neglect me
Even when I was a ?...
Even when I went to these meetings straight dolo
I had to go solo. I used to have a group
That group used to wear Adidas and
?... and then I got stupid and left them niggas
And said I'm better than ya'll when it was true
Now when I finally got the power man what the **** did I do?

And I'm so sorry to how every one of ya'll had to fight for my name
Every one of ya'll a year ago, that all waited for this change
Everyone who said "Kanye is that nigga quit talkin' names"
And I know! I am the one to blame
And the people that I-I-I, let down
I want to tell you right here - right here, right now
That I'm a new man that understands why people abusing the power

*Crowd erupts drowning out the lyrics*

And make more music for the world to love!
And there's so many people I could thank there's my Mom and God and above
So all ya'll, and everybody throw your hands in the sky!
Everyone touch the sky before the day never dies! dies! dies!

No one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!

Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

Man Mel, G
I gotta pour my heart out on this track you made
It just made me feel like I had to say something
Like what I'm going through right now
I'm Kanye-to-the and the Roc is in the building right now
Feel me on this

Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore

Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley, they gon' call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with Jay-Z, yo
For the tracks, charge around 800 C-notes
So glad I ain't take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repo'd
I broke up with my girl today around 3-0
My man said, "Let's call some girls that we know"
Sometimes I wanna say, "Fuck my bitch"
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin' chick sucked my dick
It wouldn't make me not feel so sick
Just because, they came over to cheer me up
Smoked, drank, and yeah we fucked
But nothin' that they did could've been enough

I'ma need to take a hit of that dro
I'ma smoke l never smoked before

Now this weed, drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me, that's an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin'
Girl, told you don't leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon' leave your ass
But when he get low, he gon' need your ass
If he cryin', callin', bawlin'
Y'all've been together too long for all this name callin'
Y'all'll be back together in a day or two
Yeah we be makin' up but when we makin' up
All we're makin' up is the truth
Damn, I know she love me, oh
But I'm in the Matrix and I'm feelin' I'm Neo
She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
Or write a four page letter like Aaliyah
But I'm a Gemini that's bossy like a Leo
And sometimes I don't know what side I'm on
I just know this Patron got me gone
And I've done fucked up so bad that I can't go home

I'ma smoke like l never smoked before

What are they gon' tell me?
You know what I'm saying
I used to be in gym class like "Nigga, I'm finna be a rapper"
I didn't do my homework for my last three years of high school, nigga

So I'm assuming ya'll niggas don't know what you doing
You're not hot cause your tapes don't work
We can't stop, our brakes don't work
Man I heard you spit your favorite verse
It's the softest place on Earth
Ya'll some motherfucking idiots
Dropping enough bricks to build a city with
What the fuck is on your mind?
You sniffing that shit
My own blood, go on stud
Probably the reason that the phone bugged
Always talking fast as hell like Bone Thugs
You act like you don't know what the chrome does
Like what 2 shots to the dome does
Plus you kind of slow man
But if we listen to you
We all be broke like Gary Coleman
I'm trying to blow like Pokemane
And I don't want to have to choke you man
I'd rather go to bed, getting head on the sofa man
Yo but, aigh, it's over man

Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop me!
You the only Nigga who lights went out fucking ?? 2000!

Let's go man
I hate a gold digging bitch that want to get in my whip
Fuck fucking, I make her kiss the tip of my dick
You know what I'm here for cut all that crying and shit
Plus my nigga want a fit
Why don't you buy him some shit?
I'm from the land of the P-I-M-P
I got these hoes buying the weed and the optimos
Why you think my neck froze?
Why I got these clothes?
PSSH Man I gots to pose
Next to the, lex to the, benz fit ya, next time we, fuck, bring ya, friends with ya
And he doesn't take American Express
I hate lame niggas, I hate gay niggas, I hate a dick riding I-I-I I know Kanye niggas

I did about 4 or 5 beats for Nas
This nigga don't know how to pronounce my name because they always spell it wrong
Shit, you know I'm saying, I'mma I'mma tell it real, you know what I'm saying? That's not cool, y'all can't even...

We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind

I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor aisle
She said, 'i hope its not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, "whooa!"
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home
Where the problems is
Arguments be daily like
Carson is

Hol' up, wait a second man
That's that thrift sto info
That's sauce again
Why don't chu talk to the mouth a the horses
Bout my porshes?
Condo's in front a the golf courses
Instead you stay up
Count every second like a fake rolley

The way this relationship should go if you know me
I ain't call you
You wanna know why? I mean you know why
How on the low I push jet-skee's so I
Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla
Nextel, my cell it don't work down there
And what happened in cancun, stay down there
What's happenin here, made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat. Why you always makin a beef?
What the problem is?!?!?

Man boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four
I ain't messin wit them girls no more...this week
The benz coup is so sweet
When I roll down the street
Tears roll down her cheeks
She said, 'you must love that car more than me'
A nigga I was wit chu before the cheese
So you need to work on your priorities
If she went wit 'Fabulous'
AR-GU-IN-G, Please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm gettin spins on
WU-KR, Cin-ci-nat-ti
You think I get my voice so deep
Like WU-KR, cin-ci-nat-ti
As far as this...

Last night I dreamt of an angel
I almost passed away you're yesterday but I'm blessed today
On top of the world acts so painful
It ain't no mystery, it's meant for me to make history

Niggas thought I couldn't rhyme but I tricked 'em
My pulse quickened, I
Brought myself outta last place, I Michael Vick'd 'em
Niggas thought I let 'em down like Tyson
I got the belt like Lewis
I took these beats, I passed 'em to myself, I'm Kordell Stewart
Back on the corner, back on the block
The Quincy Jones of hip hop, it's my time like Warner
Since I shine like Shyne in '99 with his
A lot of people talkin' real outta like with this
There's a war going on a few bitches wanna start with me
Showing the New World, I'mma Order even more of me
So I can live forever like diamonds
Throw your diamonds up, cause almost dying ain't stop me from rhyming
I hate a deadbeat nigga that rely on his man
See he'll lie on his dick but won't lie on the stand
And go to every single barbershop and lie to the fans
So it's time for Kanye to put the Chi on again
I'm the 2003, Do Or D-I-E
They trying to say the best nigga is Twista, then me
It's all R.O.C., it's all family tree
I got that new G5 he got that new Hum-Vee
Incorporate Young Hov and that's The Blueprint 3
And The Blueprint 2 is 3 mil right now
So cut all that, "I don't like Bonnie & Clyde shit out
Listen

Oooh hooo
I got nowhere to

Dawg, there's nowhere to hide
All I got is my pride
I almost died
I keep that 2Pac feeling alive
You have no idea how I'm feeling inside
It's the Roc throw your diamonds up in the sky

I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
I'm saying I put my personality into it

These hoes is all the same
They all want a nigga hollering out "money ain't a thing"
'Bout pathetic as a player that lost his game
How a motherfuckin' hoe turn a pimp to a lame
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Cause that's how these hoes'll get you wrapped up
Calling you later saying what she crying about
Put that bitch on now what she lying about
Talking about how she late and how she eat a lot
See she eat a lot cause she smoke weed a lot
Why all the bogus hoes want to front on k
Why the fine hoes can't have one on the way
I prolly tell her to keep it, it'll be our little secret
As long as she don't flip it tell her man that we creepin'
What we doin' is all day
When I hang up it ain't called hate its called wait
When you get popped don't call me call Clay
That's your man ain't it
That's the plan ain't it
When she told me it was mine I damn near fainted

Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
Shit I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago

Now these hoes run gun I ain't finna say nothing
She tried to pop my pockets before I even got paid
Don't trip, this bitch was a whip
You could learn something from her but you might get burned from her
We smoked a couple of dimes I hit it a couple of times
Now she say she pregnant and its mine
I'm thinking she was lying by the looks on her face
But she started paging me like every single day
She said her man going away the judge gave him three
Must've thought she was gon' make a fool out of me
To bail this nigga out all she need was a G
Now she must've came to me so I had to change the beat
I said look hoe you must be crazy off that dope
That's when I snatched the rope then I kicked her on the floor
And all that shit I bought you bitch I want it back
You lied to me return of the Mac

All y'all niggas is new with it
I paid my dues with it
Gave hoes abortion loot they bought shoes with it
Say they pregnant who's is it
Tell 'em you did it
Forcing these niggas out of abortion cheese
Paid a couple of hundred now or later more than G's
I knocked up this girl I barely liked cause she bugged me
She ain't even cute, our baby prolly by ugly
How much it cost to get rid of it? I give you half of that
But I didn't know that she was on the pill
Needed the money for her hair and her nails
And her cell phone bill
Hoes'll get you its like getting robbed without a pistol
What happen nine months later when she was telling the truth

Let's go, let's go, let's

She don't believe in shooting stars
Couture from the store's department
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
'til I got flashed by the paparazzi

I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thang
Aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home
You know you can't roam without Caesar

You know, I'm 'sposed to talk about what some of these songs mean
And some of the stuff is so personal to me
And some of the things I've been through is so real
In the form that I'm 'sposed to break down certain things
And this is one of the first times, because I feel like I'm placed in front of the audience right now
And uhm, certain things are just hard for me to talk about
And I'm sorry VH1 for that
But it uhm, certain things are too serious

And I stand before you, just a human being trying to improve under the microscope
Just the star of the Truman show
As every day I take as calculated
Every time I put on my shoes
Under the flashing lights

Just got an email today
A new book coming out
What the media doesn't want you to know

And you know, now that my momma passed
Would she really want me to put myself in a situation where I go to jail?
FOR KILLING 'EM

And the public perception
Where I feel like I'm always in defense of myself
And I realize that I've made some mistakes, but I grow from them
It's like I'm fighting to be me, but I have to leave the fight
'Cause it helps everyone else be who they wanna be

That's a story for your ass

Yo it's your boy, super pro-huhum, I mean super RAPPER Kanye West
I want to shout out all my Heavy Hitters. Yo, G & Hop what up?
Was it because of the Roc
That she wanna rock with West?
Because after the Blueprint I got lots of checks
She don't play X-Box but got a box of X
That make her tongue move faster than Das EFX
Uh, white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie they only fives but together they tens
And would I do them again?
Hummm, it's like old folks pissin' cause it all Depends
And there's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose will get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin'
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse them
Buyin' boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy choose 'em
And take 'em back to confuse 'em
See she don't know if she's comin' or goin'
Cause mommy after I'm cummin' I'm goin'
Back to the show
Just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin'
It's like somethin' outta nowhere
Yeah, and I've been known to have a ho or two
Cause my diamond's yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em, "Step into the vocal booth"
Roll a joint, smoke a few
After that I'm pokin' you
After that it's over boo
Baby grab your coat and peeeeuuuun
She said, "I love you K."
"I know you do. If I was you I'd love me too."
Yoooooooou
Not used to what I got to offer
Please get up off me baby, you can't boss me
I wish I would let her dictate
All she can tell me is how the dick taste
How she gonna tell K about L.A.?
When I got three hoes that stay in Marina Del Ray
Well paid, they don't park it, just valet
Waist small like the Motorola Cingular cell-y
Voice high like Mich'elle
I step back like, "Haha
You ever ran for Miss L.A.?"
Cause you holdin' down the city officia-lly
Next time you fuckin' your man, just yell, "K"

Hold up, hold up. I'm sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin' now! Almost forgot that part

I ride for this shit, and I'll die for this shit
And I'll ride for this shit, and I'll die...

I don't want to be like what everyone else be like
If that means I gotta be like what everyone else be like
I don't want to be liked
If I gotta be like, what everyone else gotta be like
Then I don't want to be liked
And look to the sky above
Being liked if nothing, when you could be loved
God is love
So I would rather follow God than to follow the media
I would rather follow God than to follow perception
Because most artists aren't appreciated in their own time
So the more and more disliked, the better I must be doing
You know why? Because I don't want to be liked
If that means, I gotta be like the way everyone else gotta be like
The way everyone else sees like
The way everyone else does
I've got my own vision and make my own decisions
And don't ask for permission, and I am on a mission
I am on a mission
I only want to do it on my conditions
I only want to do it my way
I'm only going to do it His way
I'm only going to do it this way
If you love someone tonight
Hold on to it
Hold on, hold on real tight

Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they?

For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
Telling her her son's on life support?
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2pac died
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you

But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised

I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah

Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve

Not a minute more
Not a second more
Not infinite though
Watchu waitin for?
Never nah, no, say
Takin off time
Takin off day
Whatchu fightin for?
When yo booty flow
Who that known it though
Whatchu waitin for?
If you runnin from love
You love her like that
You runnin' from nuns
She running right back
Because it's

And I'm on a road
And I'm backin? No
To love you no more
To look back and forth
Till you got it from the
You got it what what
Baba ba ba baa
One a 44
Till I'm on the road
I know we would know
I'm backin' on up
I'm makin mine
Till I cannot stop in the night

Oh oh yeah
Oh yeah
Throw your hands up
And keep em up now
And keep em up high
No no no
Baby no
And we ain't goin' down baby
Oh no no
No, we ain't goin' down
You gotta keep em up high, high
And we ain't going down baby

Walla boom mena
I've been on that money
Money done side
Paper lined up all fallin'
And they linin club poppin'
And they down to throw
I'm just zonin'
Eh... nah
Actin' like purple salt
I've been on that rhyme till I get it now
Puffin up
Making money
Grindin paper
Make it witch you

Then after the night)

We only makin' the highlights slow motion, slow motion
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights

You got to get up every morning
With a smile on a face
And show the world all the love in your heart

Oh no, got to play this shit back
Pool party and the weekend that's the business
This one white girl told me she hate white cock
That's when I knew hip-hop was the new rock
When you knew you got to keep your bitch ziploc
Cause a nigga still got her Gucci flip flops
I might tell a lesson and still is my mentor
Famous people act so damn pretentious huh
What you need just a hour or some interest huh
And that bitch ain't even religious huh
Crack code, crack sale, why niggas got mail
Might drop a baby line and call that shit Pastelle
Walkin', livin', breathin', girl you know my past well

I love social media, I love fitness, and I love photography

I need at least seven days, with Chloe Sevigny
Since I saw Brown Bunny it ain't never been the same
I ain't gon' tell you that I ain't never been a lame
Ever since I got that Roc-A-Fella chain
Man shit just changed, shit just change
Get this thing, hop on plane

Heartless
How could you be so?

Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
Ayyo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayyo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna give me back and you gonna show me
So you walk round like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies

Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
You'll never find nobody, never find nobody better than me

Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk Baby let's just knock it off
And you just gon' keep hating me
And we just gon' be enemies
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

To a woman so, a woman so

There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To take my mind out of this hell
Or my heart out of this jail
There are no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back, a piece of real life
Real life, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like?
People say, you keep it too real boy

With a woman so heartless
So heartless
Is it my fault that I make you heartless?
Maybe I made you heartless, but regardless
That don't give you the reason to act retarded
Yeah we fall, but you started
You started

No, no, no, nobody knows
Nobody knows

Did it have to go that far?
Did we have to take it that far?
You say things some time that you just can't take back
Take back, take back
You're gonna hit me one day, so take that, so take that
And that's something you just can't take back, take back, take back
Never do nothing you can't take back, take back

Does this hurtful comment have a receipt?
Does this staggering piece of truth, that was never told, have an expiration date?
Or can I take that back?
Take that back

And I guess it's in nighttime, I here 'em talk
The coldest story ever told, the coldest story ever told
Ever told, never told
When I say the coldest story I mean the voices in my head
When I lay down in my bed
The voices in my head, when another woman is beside me in my bed

In the night I here 'em talk
Coldest story ever told
Did I make you be heartless?

50 look at me now
Singing on the ground
With my pink shirt on
Does this look gay to you?
Well, I don't know what else to say to you
Look at me now
I'm on the ground
And my heart can still not be found
'Cause I've looked all around
And my heart will never be found
I looked all around
And my heart's nowhere to be found
Where is my heart right now?

I lost my soul
To somebody so heartless

Ladies and gentlemen let's put our hands together for the astonishing
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century, oh it's timeless, HOV'!
Thanks for comin' out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that, uhhd

Yo this song right here, I remember I used to play
This sample for people before I hooked up
And I used to tell people "you know, this, this gon' be like The Truth
"I mean ask these but it ain't no Truth, that ain't no Truth right there!"
And he was all like, the Takeover

Five to one, baby, one in five
No one here, gets, out alive, now
You'll get yours, baby, I'll get mine
Gonna make it, baby, if we try

The old get old, and the young get stronger
May take a week, and it may take longer
They got the guns, but we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah we're, takin' over
Come on!

R.O.C., we runnin' this rap shit
Memphis Bleek, we runnin' this rap shit
B. Mac, we runnin' this rap shit
Freeway, we runnin' this rap shit
O and Sparks, we runnin' this rap shit
Chris and Neef, we runnin' this rap shit

The takeover, the break's over nigga
God MC, me, Jay-Hova
Hey lil' soldier you ain't ready for war
R.O.C.'s too strong for y'all

Ac'right nigga!

Uh, uh, listen
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov'
What's up y'all niggas all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
And my records movin' out the store

Ain't no love, in the heart of the city
Ain't no love, in the heart of town
Ain't no love..

Yeeehh

I never change, this is Jay every day
I never change, this is Jay

Never gave up, never gave in

My reign is as far
Bring it back down though

Never take that from me

No take it back down, take it back, keep going

It feels like you're on trial sometimes
And in a relationship, you can also be on trial
And be convicted with no jury

And this song was sort of like that moment where someone tells you ain't, you ain't - you gotta say I am - an emancipation, if you will
Cause you can't take that from me
My self-esteem

So whether it something in your own home, or a situation like mine
Where you're under the microscope of the media

Never let them take that from you
I never let them, let them take that from me

You have to be amazing sometimes
I and I know I do not always state popular opinion

Amazing, Michael Jackson, amazing
Michael Phelps, amazing
OJ Simpson, amazing
Is het not?!
What he did when he did what he did, was he not amazing though?

I think I saw in a movie - I get my quotes from movies cause I don't read
Or from like, go figure, real life or something
Like live real live, talk to real people, get information, ask people, questions
And it was something about, you either die a superhero or you live to become the villain
I'M CHILLIN'

*Kanye chicken noise*

I'm chillin'

So many times they try to make me out to be the villain
I don't understand what I did
I apologize for acting like a bitch at award-shows
It's an award-show, didn't kill anyone
But yet and still I apologize for my ungraciousness

I was a spoiled little Chicago-boy, who got all these awards as he came in the door and people clapped and sang his praises
And he soaked it all up and believed his own hype
To the point where he could not lose
And if anyone didn't pick him, they could not choose
As he swooves with the who's-who's and broke all the rules
And even lost his cool
Hey, nothing new
Now they don't like you, hey they don't like you
Look at what you've done boy, trying to be the number one boy

And I'm thirty-one years now and I've leaned from my mistakes

Just play pianos...

Super-hero music, pain

This hardcore, so hardcore

I'm a monster, I'm maven

Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I'll never be picture perfect Beyonce
Be light as Al B., or black as Chaun-cey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the sum-time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mi-mink boots in the winter time like Will.I.Am

Let me know if you feel it man
I just messed up on my rap, live TV like damn
But hey, hey here we again yeah
He-here we go again
People talking this but when this hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me
Now break it down

Yo, off the top of the dome, dome
Shout out to Chi-town where I call home
Coast to coast, LA to New York to London to Paris
Shout out to Barry
That's my security guard
Cause my rhymes is hard
Listen up I got to praise god
For the number one spot that I got cause I'm hot
And everything I am cause of everything I was not
Cause I never was shot
They said I'd never make raps to hit the block
Or never sold a crack rock
But now everybody on the jock
And I got the game lock
Everybody bring it back
With the rap I don't know how to act I go crazy
Backstage, Beyonce and Jay-Z
And LeBron and I'm gone
I'm the don, number one
Keep going going on
Got to keep it going on
I keep goin' goin' goin' yeah
I keep flowin' flowin' flowin'
Yo, I meant to freestyle, I meant to mess up
Y'all meant to dress up
Ay yo, I'm fresh up
Who fresher than Mr. West uh
No-no-no-no-nobody I'm talking all y'all right now
The blogs, the blogs
Yo, they try to dis me
But they can not see I'm on Saturday Night getting busy
Y'all wish ya can be me, hey mama can you see me?
Hey daddy can you see me?
I'm rocking on your TV
Y'all thought they'd never let me back in NBC, see?
La La La Laaaa

I been waiting, for a minute
Pour out, everything
Pour out, everyday

Last down I'm down in Mexico
Asking my why the hell I test the cove
Four times I say don't test me hoe
Told you four times don't test me hoe
Now we finna lose all self control
And I..

I wish I would let ahead and fuck my life up
Sunday night I just might have to pipe up

Oh, life's a feeling
Oh, the body's a feeling
The future is uncertain for us all
Just now
Why hang things up

A body map of Kanye West's tattoos, starting from the top-right, working down to bottom-left

You got to

Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down

So won't you hook a chew scorns, she tellin you buy
Street poetry is how ya boy get paid
And I wear no Escalade, metallic, black or beige
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say

Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
And where the Glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams
See I showed you on the champions how we get down
So don't twist ya lips, I'm like Bobby Brown
You got B2K on all your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan, gonna work ya walls
Straight from the South side of dem Chi-town streets

And if you talk about him, aiiyo I take you out
Either with the nine or the tech's in his mouth
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgie's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine so you couldn't relate

Quence without the game, now he's back to ball
You starin at my Rolls' cold way to long
But I ain't scared of robbers, why I wear tephlon
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama holler at ya boy

Cause it don't look like a thug or a hood
But he keep dem gorilla's so we still be good
I'ma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they reps
I'ma milk the game, 'til we all can eat

Cause that shit'll have me zonin for a couple of weeks

Now your momma told you let the Cleveland show
Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough
They're fakin pregnancies and Cartier tournier

Menace, Skates to Lou and 'em Puffs from L.B
They know the Consequence be wearin gold and ice
Ey shorty let me tell you 'bout the rules of my Nikes
It seems they always keep on movin, I don't hear nuthin twice

Relax yaself or we'll whack ya down

It's your hometown boy Mark Spitz and uh
Now I've been getting fucked up all night long
This weed and this drink I got is almost gone
And I've been doing wrong my whole life long
So here's my song
Here's my song

Five pounds of dro
Five rounds or mo'
Tore from the flo'
Two sets of hoes
K. West to go
Okay one more for me)

Let me talk on this
Let me walk on this
Mark Spitz extra clips of hollow tips
I'm full throttle with Chicago trips
Hits model chicks without the bread
Moet bottles flip, I'm out my head
Okay no more for me
Fuck it, one more for me
Send another round around for all my Gs
Quarterback in the streets
Throw a zip for three
Mr. MC on the beats that still spin when I freeze
In the city by the sea, bitch
Feel the breeze
Hot head, I got steel to squeeze
See easy

The west is on my back, K. West is on the track
'kay?
Now we fiend to get it jumpin' like the jacks
Dimes and hoodrats, get down on the flo'
And pop that ass 'til it's time to go

I came to the club with a gang of niggas
But I left from the club with a gang of bitches
Just got my pimp cup now my name is Bishop
In a money green suit, ice cane and lizards
The P chain still hangs but it's changed to Spitz
The blues always authentic gangsta shit
Now take this and run with it
Go have fun with it
But make sure you bring it back when you're done with it
Long Beach done done it again
It's been ten
And we've been it since then as little kids
You niggas can't tell me shit on how to sell with this
I'm hot as hell, we done done it again

Don't worry Chi-town
It's ya boy Kanye To The
I got this!

You at the bar tryin' to ask what that Hypno hit fo'
If you gotta ask that you can't afford to get mo'
Dawg, slow down you can't afford to sip Mo'
Leave the club now, come back when you get dough
Many hoes, many many many many many hoes
Centerfolds, especially I'm in the Go
Cadillac back to back, red, black to indigo
Tell me that I ain't pimpin' yo
Especially they in a row?
Keep a least two, that can't keep they cool
Cause I stay G'd up like the first week of school
Broke girls, I take 'em to the Section 8
Where I pass the dick around like a collection plate
White girls said, "La Di Da Di, we love to party"
And that bitch ain't broke so that mean she sniff coke
And she only 17 so that mean she can't vote
So if we do anything, that mean you can't quote

Now I'm the newest member of the rockafella team
And I'ma bring Dame and HOV mad more cream
Leave your city shook for sure
And I'ma bring 'em back where Beans took 'em before
For the last time it's 'Kanye' and not Kane
Everybody mispronouncing the name
So I spell it over and overlike my dog Fab in the game
Pick a bad chick up like a cab in the rain
All the girls that I had was the same
Cuz all they seemed to care about is what I had in the chain
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Drop the bad bitch off take a cab in the rain

Go! Why she wanna say 'hello,'
Cuz my Rock-a-fello piece is all yellow?
Yeah! She tryna get nice
Get a crib, get a ring, throw rice
No, keep that raggedy chick
She's so masculine and I ain't on that faggoty shit
My diamond ornaments help me fornicate
Girls that look like they on a porno tape
My dogs is warning me 'bout girls is wanting me
For child support, this money born to make
They stick safety pins in my magnums
Steal my condoms, I swear that's a problem

It's like gettin' robbed without a pistol
For 18 years the job is not an issue
Cuz I made a mil off instrumentals
Classify me as husband potential
Niggas ain't think I rhyme for real
I got a 'You Hear It First' 'fore I signed a deal
Yeah, now it's time to bail
Cuz five years from now I'm tryna chill
Peep the wordplay, I'm kinda ill

That's how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
OC, OG Bobby Johnson's son
Ask me "Ray Ray is that your car?
I seen MTV I know who you are
You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?"
I DID take-over the game, brought back the Soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum and gold, yeah that's the flow
All I, know, I gotsta blow
And I don't play 'pause', I'm from Chica-GO

Planes, trains, automobiles
The G500s with the auto-roll wheels
Pinot Grigio, got 'em on chill
See now, see me ho? I got that deal
If you tryna build, I bet you'd like to know that
My father was a Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt
And back in college, I ain't run with no frat
I just ran with the track that put the Chi on the map
Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion
Two years ago I was just a civilian
Now every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children

Hold up, I'm fuckin' up the rap

Every chick in here swear I got millions
Put my hoodie on, blend in like a chameleon
Hear barbershop talk, niggas try to kill him
Take my hoodie off, they like "Ye waddup, you chillin'!"
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school, back at my school
Just like Halloween minus the costumes
The niggas that's flickin' was the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' was the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationship, everybody cheatin'
I used to want the Jordans that's most recent
Now I throw Jordans on the whip just to look decent
Just to get pulled over by the precinct, so frequent
It's like I'm back bein' a delinquent
They wanna know where I live, stay, and work
Why a young black nigga get all these perks
How I stack my paper, got Adidas in every flavor
Excuse me officer, I don't know Rod Laver
Or Stan Smith, what they don't understand is
How I got that color in canvas

This song right here changed my life... come on, come on!

Jesus walk with me, he walk with the sinners cause I know I am
But I ain't no loser, I'm a winner and I know I can
Overcome the devil for he get the best of me
My daddy always said G-O-D gon' have tests for me
Illegally they told me to lie when they question me
But God sent an angel that said the truth will set you free
So in the midst of getting sued for more than my deal
I admitted I fell asleep at the wheel
Cause I realized I could've died, he saved me
Every single hit that got played he gave me
People ask me "Do you read your Bible?"
"It could help out when you need revival"
There's something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And he give me direction when I can't decide
He is alive! How could you tell me that he ain't when I said

And the only thing the radio is playing
Is because you be paying
Beasts will knock no more
Even those who be here for dope, every four days

And it's all because of him

I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
Come to meet me without, don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga
I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some theraflu

I want to make some real love, ya dadada
That was kinda raw
Yo ma that melody that shine

Mack you down like a quick dyke
Tell your friends they can hitchhike
And your tan looking just right
She grabbing on my like
She want to see if it'll fit right

No lie, no lie, no lie
You set this night on fire
Still gon' be here in the morning no lie

Make your man take a hitchhike
He don't understand how you hit right
Try it on if it fit right

Check me

I never thought I'd feel
The same as that feeling that I felt when I felt about you
And all my friends know it
But they don't say it cause, I'm not the same without, you
And I can't deny it, even if I try it, shit
I know it's so true
And as crazy as it sounds, you'll never know what I go through

I'm not gonna lie though, I'm feelin like I died slow
Sitting back like damn, where did time go
Lookin back with regeret cause I know
When you left, a part of me died slow
I kinda sorta feel defeated
I'm disappointed cause this missions incompleted
But, I can't believe that I'm free now
The noose's loose around my neck, I can breathe now
Cause, I would've told you go fuck yourself
You ain't care about shit, but yourself
Try to treat me like half a man
I should've fucked your best friend when I had the chance
Holy shit, this hoe's a trick
She tryna hit me up now like I owe her shit
Fuck that bitch, you can kiss my asshole
Because of you I am an asshole

Cause you always find, yes you always find
Bitch you always find something wrong
And i've been puttin up with your shit just way too long

Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs

It's about to get crazy, why can't she just, run away?

A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down

Till fades out

Don't let nobody tell you what you can do, what you can believe, what you can achieve. Don't let nobody but you

I just got off the plane, Chicago
It's ya boy Kanye West on the beat
Ay, White Boy

I just want you to know, I just want you to know
I just want you to know, this boy here finna' blow
Southside up in here, Westside up in here
Eastside up in here, throw your hands in the air

Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear
Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggas stole the soul, y'all niggas all some clones
Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga, I control the 'go
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around niggas before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero?
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no?
No means no just as sure as green means go
Green means paper, dream team caper
We see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people
Come through ya block and air people
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people

White Boy back in the mix and I'm in the atmosphere
Crunkin' for stackin' the fifth and we got them gats in here
This is not a game, Cris is not a lame
Chi-town drop the flame, White Boy got them thangs
White Boy a hot damn shame, White Boy hot like mars
Y'alls flow hot like March, y'all can't stop these bars
White Boy drop these charts, White Boy got the ball
Lyrics gon' shock you all, Cris gon' cop them cars
Get a couple foxy broads, out they shoes socks and bra
This is not so hard, Cris got a rocky heart
Pimp wit' a monster walk, Cris got hostile thoughts
Y'all better watch it dawg, me and West rock you dawg

Rap profit, plat Gothic, slash convict raps jock it, phat
Pockets mac, hopin' crack, poppin' stacks
Droppin' cakes, stoppin' wakes, knockin' hate
And you fakes, watchin' base, on relate
Gossip fakes and I make, opt, yeah
In case I catch a case gots to pay, confrentrate
If this ain't the way, Kanye, then it's straight
Colleges in ya veins cause you spit what you came from
Straight knowledge, I was raised in the street
Praised in my heat, holdin' on my Nextel
Hopin' for the next cell, focused on the best cell
Smokin' on a fresh L, posted like FedEx mail

Yo, I'mma rise to the top cause it ain't in me to fail
Or die bustin' at the cops before they send me to jail
The same nigga ya serve with won't even send you the bail
And sail with some niggas tryin' to send me to hell
So whether
Rap or crack
Beats or streets
This summer I'm rockin' ice to beat the heat
Now I'm gonna cop a Benz 6 and tell 'em "Keep the Jeep
Keep the receipt, keep the change, keep the game."
As long as I keep the fame and keep my name
Kanye to the
Motherfuckin' West
She said, "You from The Outfit?"
I told her, "Motherfuckin' yes."
So every time I spit, it's got to be fresh
So whether freestyle or written
What's the point of rhyme?
I'd rather hear somethin' bitten, as long as it's hittin'
Wack niggas grab my tracks, just get to shittin'
My niggas grab they gats, just get to spittin'
Faggot niggas be like, "Uh huh, no he didn't."
But I did
Ever since I hooked with Syndicate
And shit
I've been blazin' niggas ever since
Ya heard me?
Blazin' niggas ever since

The conman, aw, damn, we back in town, word

I'm sick and tired of you sittin' around here all day
I'm sick and tired of you smokin' weed in the hallway
But why you worried about me?
Why you worried about what I'm doin' here?
Why you got to embarrass me in front of company?

Damn, you back from your trip
I thought the plane would have helped you over
Stop sellin' crack out the crib, yeah, when hell freeze over
Dog, you talkin' way too fast, tell me it slower
But if you buy me this, ma, I promise I'll pay you back
But the way you act, I be really want to see you dead
Plus it's four hundred missin' from under my bed
They put me in arrest and have you beat them 'bout the iron
When them niggas rushed the crib
I was the one that poured the ice in them

We have, we have in this corner the dead heat roommate
Fresh from his momma crib
He embossed the market thanks to my sponsorship
I ain't finna argue 'bout what we finna watch, dog
I can't even bring hoes to my spot
You be tryin' to thug 'em out, roommate version of Pac
When it's not grievin' when I ask where you'd be
Then you borrowed my clothes, don't do that
But I'm feelin' like Perfect Strangers
Cause you about to crowd me, get the fuck out

You got all these Halle Berry posters in the crib
How you think she feel about you havin' roaches in the crib?
I got my name on the orange juice, posted in the crib
She drinkin' out the pitcher like most of it was his
Nigga, what the fuck you did with my pornos and comic books?
How come I never got the message that my people said you took?
Look, who the fuck you down with?
Cause them chromes is off the hook
You try to cook, nigga, look, I don't ever try to cook
I just been tryin' to get back that money that I loaned your ass
Off the books, off the books, yep, a month ago
You must have forgot, you must be thinkin' that I'm rich
Because I'm rollin' with the rocks

And you never paid me back
From the time that you broke the toilet
Cause I need my own space, so I'm sorry you bought 'em out

No reindeers, just horses and a Panamera Porcshe

Thugs think I'm a Blood cause I won't take this red suit off
I let my beard grow cause it's cold in the North Pole
Her voice slow cause "I always got a sore throat"
You never see me cause I shop when the stores close
Everybody gets gifts as long as I'm living
So look forward to having

Lenox ave Saint Nick
Same hustlers running up the Broadway
No turkey at greens, just Jimbo's
Christmas lights and project windows
Berkman, Shapiro, Calena, Hanukkah

All of the flashing lights
Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus

Do you think I sacrificed, real life
Do you think I sacrificed, a real life
What does it feel like,What does it feel like
I ask you tonight, What does it feel like
The funny thing is
It's like I'm lookin out there, tryna find something
So what does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade that no one can really feel
For everybody that sees you that say, wait a second "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, to say sign can you sign a autograph
Real life,Real life

Nigga don't miss, better not miss
Better not miss... Better not miss
Better not miss, better not miss, better not miss...

Don't miss, don't miss...
The camera's on, you gotta do it like, this...
And move your other leg like, this...
And uh, don't get nobody pissed
AYE NIGGA, AYE NIGGA DON'T MISS!
Everyday's the super bowl...
You better not miss!
NIGGA DON'T MISS!
Because uh
If you miss one step we gon', we gon' treat you like this...
We gon' talk shit about you like this
We gon' beat you up like this
We gon' say that people don't like you
We gon' try to make the whole world hate you...
Don't tell, don't never say what everybody else is thinking...
Nigga, nigga don't miss...
Walk perfectly, in this town...

And I feel down again, when I'm down again...
And I'm down again...

Can you imagine how many times they told me
That I would never work in this town again?
In this town again...
And I felt down again, and I felt down again...
I'd never work in this town again
But now, 2 nights at the Hollywood Bowl, sold out!
AYE, Don't let 'em bring you down, don't let 'em bring you down, down...
It's more ways than they way to do it
And I'm here to prove it...
I'm here to prove it, I'm here to prove it...
I'm here to prove it...
Nigga don't miss, nigga don't miss
Walk like this, do it like this
Don't get nobody pissed
And they told me, told me...
For 6 years that ain't nobody love me
And they told me, they told me...
You better not show your face in public boy
They told me
Better stand still Emmett Till, better stand still Emmett Till
They told me, they told me, they told me...
Like Pinocchio, they must have lied
Cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
Oh, they must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, lied...

Ain't nobody lookin' like you do

Let's have some fun now
Get up and touch it

Before the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Testify
I'm up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Before Cam got them hits to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Take 'em back to the club
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In a accident, cause this must be heaven

Back when Gucci was the hits to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man - these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
I'm trying to right my wrongs

Feels good to be home, feels good to be home

Are y'all happy you came to VH1 Storytellers?

Get up and touch the sky, come on

I am so disappointed, that I cannot see me perform
Except for on playback
My greatest pain in live, is that I'll never see me perform
So you are welcome to know a pleasure, that I will never have

This song is what inspired 808's and Heartbreak more than anything
Because we used do this at the end of the tour every night
And I would do it for - how many of you saw the Glow In The Dark tour in the room tonight?
Thank you so much, for coming to the tour

So y'all remember at the end of the show I would do this song
And I would say some inspirational words and I would sing
And I had the opportunity to just kind of do it and play it off
But I discovered that I love to sing
So much and to my thing and harmonize and just go up and down and just fuck around

I really feel like a vessel
And I open my mouth and God will let beautiful words flow through
That's why I realized that he chose me and he has a path for me
Because half the things that come out, I can't be responsible for
And I guess he just wants me to say more and more and more and never be insecure and always be sure, be sure
And he will give me the strength I need to endure, for sure
As I tour and bring the pure
So much more, more, for sure
For your entertainment, education and relation
To take away your hesitation and segregation

In a country full of immigrants, where no one really was born here, but separated here
It's a beautiful thing that in a country that was so divided by the concept of black and white
We now have a black and white president

And this is what the future is to me

When a black, super-Hip-Hop-dressed dude gets on an elevator and there's an old lady with Chanel and she grabs her purse
I'll give you a cliche example
What would happen if they actually talk to each other?
What would she learn? What would he learn?

When the rich man hopping out the Lincoln Town Car, passes by the homeless person
And they actually talk to each other
What would he learn? What would he learn?

If a black man, that came from Chicago and was taught to stand so far away from gay people, 'cause you do not want to be accused of being gay
Was to talk to a gay person
What would he learn? What did I learn?

I learned that people in Chicago was wrong
And I've been an asshole all along
A lot of things that you learn are wrong
So don't be an asshole too long, too long, too long
You can't be an asshole too long

'Cause the more you know, the more you grow, the more responsibility you have show what you know
And give everything that you got to give, baby that's the reason God let me live through the accident without practicing
Okay, got to bring this up and bring it back again
No publishing Outkast, please
Shout out to three G's
One of the few dressed quite as fresh as me

Bitch please don't act like we special
I'm so special, I'm so special, I'm so special

Don't want nobody to die
Don't want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that's just the way, I guess that's just the way
Have it your way

It's gonna be slow singing, flower bringing
Gat clinging, bat swinging, bullets flyin', niggas dyin'
Mom's cryin, faggots really don't want it
Lead coming, blood gushin from ya arms, legs, head and stomach
I felt the hatred, cause when I turned around like the Matrix
Comin for me, an array of bullets headin dead for me
First the one, and then came the two and three and four
Five, six, seven, shots from a mac 11
Platinum producer killed by haters tonight on Channel 7
He do beats for 2Pac, now coming out the spring from Heaven
Ya know my piece is, hotter than grease is
With no wrong way to eat ya face like a Reese's
Seem like the second I get some shine
Niggas quit they fuckin' job so they can hate full time
So, gimme the gat, I hit em wit that
Cock back, blat blat
Let me tell you niggas something familiar
Broke niggas don't want war, man I'll kill ya

Oh oh, I get it, this year, niggas don't dance
But just rock bulletproof hats and steel pants
Now everybody got a gun in they hand, yeah bitch nigga run to ya man
Street sweeper aerials fuck where they land
Niggas close they eyes and don't aim like My bitch when she pop champagne
Bottles, I tell you bout them damn models
They can't cook for a lick, but they'll lick a dick and swallow
Look I been living my life, Bullshittin' when I write songs
Especially talkin' bout havin' ice on and I could barely keep my lights on
Niggas played me like Ty-Son, trying to take my light songs
Cuse they know I'd knock niggas the fuck out the box
Full Glocks, the fuck out the box, cocked
Who the fuck tryin to box right now?
I feel like, my whole city on my back
I feel like, next year, my whole city on the map

I'm from, Chi town, where the raps the realest
The tracks gorilla, we got the millas and we'll be at ya scrilla
Close your doors, lock your windows
We be at them execs for them back end checks
Now, We on the court, and we got next up
Now, This summer we got benz, we got Lex truck
It's kinda like trading places huh? I never plug
But I'm guilty by association, so gangstas show me love
For that track I did, yeah I know, the rest the album wack as shit
Ooooh, its Kanye to the with that platinum shit, ya punk bitch

To my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where da girls cook catfish
And in LA every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass to sell a lot of sex
And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
Where they speak southern and slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feelin myself too much I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows, I'm
Callin...

Uh! And I'll be trying to come around my girl acting like Mr
Friendly
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own, I got Paris he got Nicky he tried to get em a
Clone
He said yeah you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here, is a heat rocks
Spit like a beat box, the way the beat rocks
New version of Pete Rock!
So I switch my girls around like 3LW
I'm calling

What up Pam how your little man doin in New Jersey
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta better believe it
Shanice you're my piece from Compton
Before I mark the plane make sure you cop them trees to spark
Danielle ATL got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you send it with Chanel
You lookin good in that one showin off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cardi's
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry
But, hey Kim how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty hate to show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love you girls though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time

Be with, no one, but me, baby

DJ Boom, beats on streets and here with my man Kanye West
Producer of H to the Izzo, Takeover and all that. Let them know man

Yo, it's Kanye to the man. Just play my shit man
Yo, DJ Boom, back for the first time. It's really my first time yo
This is...Kanye to the. Not on the beat though
You know what I'm sayin'? ON the beat motherfuckers
What up G? What up Hop? Look, c'mon

As a shorty had a Schwinn, look that's the best bikes
Shorty had three friends, that's my best dykes
Said her best friend wanna see what Kanye West like
Cause her man dress like a transvestite
You ain't know I get a deal because I rhyme tight
Sport Rocs before your deal to be an Unsigned Hype
Give a fuck about your rippin' down some open mics
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these beats for free, psych
You rappers too lame, you ain't James, y'all ain't worthy
I fly out to Newark just to get some new jerseys
I be back to Chi about every two Thursdays
I can't buy water around niggas too thirsty
I can't rock ice around niggas too hatin'
Can't rock Motorola, niggas two wayin'
I Alter like Beast in an altercation
Infrared make you juke like Walter Payton
So, grand theft auto
Come up out your auto
Mobile, before I pull more steel than Soprano
Still trying to make more meals than McDonald's
So cut my slice like Giordano's
And they did
I made 500 Gs in this
First beat on what The Truth and The Reason is
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
Now, tell me that's that regular producer rap
You can listen to the flow and tell I used to rap
You look in my eyes
Think I won't use the gat?
Until
Paramedics gotta use the bag
Cause
In my eyes, you'se the fag
You're like a hermaphrodite dyke dressed in drag
So let's see how many slugs that vest can have
And you ain't really the worst, you just next to last
Uh, Kanye to the...motherfuckin' West

Yo, DJ Boom, good lookin' out man
Cause ah, niggas is really doubtin'
Niggas lookin' at a lot of motherfuckers they see on TV
And just figure-they be like, "Oh, you rap?"
Naw, motherfucker, I just did beats nigga
To have some shit to rap on nigga
Ha ha, I'm tryin' to understand, why the fuck if a nigga got hot beats
He can't have hot rhymes? Why is that nigga?
Why niggas just can't do a lot of shit good?
What a nigga can chew gum and tie his shoes at the same time?
Fuckin' A&Rs

Oh, baby, how you doing?
You know I'm-a cut right to the chase, huh
Some women were made
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know?
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on--baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky; that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gon' need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

He talk like this 'cause he can back it up

He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find
Out what I'm working with

Damn, I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy, you're a sight to see, kinda something like me

I talk like this 'cause I can back it up

I got a big ego
But he love my big ego
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up
I can back it up

Such a huge ego, such a huge ego
But I love his big ego

Ego so big you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat--I can sing it with piano

I can make shit rhyme if I'm... feel like
And if I, don't... So I just might not, cause I, don't want
And i'm just gonna, freestyle for the first time
With a freestyle, that don't even go together
Ough
No rhymes that's my new shit!
Nothing rhyme!
How that sound!
Uh ohh!
Wap!
You ain't got the answers Sway!
I could sing all, night!

*Harmonizing to rhythm of chorus*
Hello my only one
You keep on

Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun

And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought

Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, "leave me alone!"

Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me
Got into thinking its a game
And whether you in my city and I talk shit
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name
I've been known to handle my business
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla
Murder haters that I'm full of
Niggas claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003

I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
So mad, you gonna turn to Tyson
Slicin' and dicin'
Paparazzi, I'm like a Nazi to 'em
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
Aye yo, I've got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Before I lose it and have to prove it
This the way that we gon', time; we gotta move it to the future
Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya
Don't shoot ya, stop the violence and it's been stopped
We stopped the violence in the hip-hop
We stopped the hatin' and the degradation
We 'bout to build like One Nation
Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn like Ice Cube said
I'm the rudest, a lot of people say that
Cause they say, "Ye, don't play that"
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye Juice
That's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
My crib's spatial and my relationship is interracial

I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the flow, maybe the gold
Where I was grown, what I grew up in
Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy
And moved my family when I was 3
And in the cold, straight from Chicago where I go
And everybody know, from my homie Don C, I be air
Aye, yo, like IBM or Apple, Steve Jobs of this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Aye, yo, it's very, very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel, I can do it every tempo
I'll use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build churches
That could be as big as The Adam's Family's, where Lurch is
Aye, yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed, motherfuckers
It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect
And now you know it's still worth it
I might short-circuit, I might just black out
Hit you with that "BLOCKA!"
You know I'm Ibaka
Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us
Because God on my side, that's the way I ride
Jesus Christ, Yeezus nice!

One time I had lost my faith
But I had to stay faithful and grateful for the God I was given
The way that I was livin' or the life that I've been livin'
It didn't make a difference
See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents
Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather
Mother, father, now I've only got one parent
Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent
But still you've got to stay strong
I don't know what everybody else is on
Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out
Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now
And I doubt they even listen, and I ain't tryna diss 'em
But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison
And everybody say bein' a rockstar is everything
But see, I wanna do everything
And I know I could do everything
And be anything that I wanna be
So simply, if you wanna be like Mike
I wanna be like Christ, I wanna be that nice
Okay, this beat just threw me off
Took it extra old-school
This ain't no freestyle beat, yo, yo, dude!

We, should a, never ever, let Michael Jordan play for the wizards
We we, should a, never ever, let MJ play for the wizards
Why did that happen, why did that happen
We, should a, never ever, let MJ play for the wizards
And we coulda stopped it, we coulda stop, MJ playing for the wizards
6 championships, the best years of our lives
Playing playing as a Bull, every single night
I believed I could fly, and I wanted to be just like Mike
When a player, when a players that's done more for the league than the leagues done for him

If you could check in the damned there items and get back with me, it would be most greatly, preciously, hospitably appreciated
Talk to you later, bye

Hey Kanye, this is your cousin Kim
I just wanted to call ya and congratulate you on this CD, it's hot
Especially that song "Drug Dealer"
You know, I've been a social worker for 10 years
I've been paying people's lights, rents, mortgage
So, it just...
It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through
You know, and people are human
They wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do
The other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax
A lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in
The toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care
Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in
So, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work
So you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth
You have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation
Then you get paid on the job
So, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids, you know
And the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that
I mean, like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know
Tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is
Once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it
That they try to bring their kids to school
That they try to make a difference

Now when I walk in, everybody do the "Power" clap
Clap, clap, clap
Fresh for the club, I just took a half an hour nap

My socket was out the plug, now it's time to get the power back
Clap, clap
Now we all ain't going be American Idols

How Ye doing? I'm surviving

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen up man

I got girls in my room like hostages
Giving me neck like ostriches
Give some play to the real Kanye
'Cause we all know who the imposters is
All my gangsters, mob to this
And all my strippers, do your job to this
Hell no, I can't give you my cell phone
But you know where the hotel lobby is
For ya'll the same girls wouldn't give me no ass
Now I done highly surpassed my whole upper class
Bet if I meet her now I can fuck her fast, I pass
I be on some new shit
I wouldn't fuck none of the girls I went to school with
Fuck around, I ain't be on no cool shit
Like you don't see the models that me and my crew get
You don't see the frivolous jewels I bought with The Blueprint
She said "Whoa! Kanye don't get caught up in the hype
Ain't no telling they gon' love you after the night"
Well, if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend money till you're broke my, nigga, live your life
'Cause I'm living international nigga American dream
And all my dawgs living vicariously through me
So if I get head from Trin', that one for the team
Fuck 702, that one for the crew
My dawg Hip Hop really love Claudette
Just like the Brinks trucks, they know it's money inside

The Roc in here

I want everybody to put they hands together for me
Ok, come on

Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school

This little light of mine, I'm feelin' let it shine
I'm feelin' take y'all back to them better times
I was three years old when you and I move to the Chi
You fix me up something that was good for my soul
Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
And you never put no man over me, and I LOVE you for that Mommy can't you see?
I said, "Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't HURT no more!"
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta WORK no more
See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot
A living legend too, just look at what Heaven do, sent us an angel, and I thank you

And I know well that my words - they just ain't strong enough
If I had to pay for yo' love, my money ain't long enough!

It's only 60 seconds in a minute, 24 hours in a day
The sun rises, the sun sets & goes away
"How this day went so fast?" is what I thought
Only 12 months in a year - life is short
Before my time is up, you know what I'ma do?
Take this time out to say, "I love you"
Cause right after you finished raisin' all ya kids
You turned right around & raised foster kids
We was the first ones in the 'hood with bunk beds
Popped me in my mouth for somethin' I shouldn't said
& when I caught that case, ya face turned red
You picked me up from the precinct - I was a knucklehead
You told me when I frowned up my face & pout
"I brought you in this world, boy, I'll take you out"
Daddy's stressin' you out? You tired of the drama?
Divorce that fool - I'll marry you, Mama

Baby, just forget everything that you know
Let's take it all the way back to hello
They say you livin' like you died before
I got a place that only I can go

Let me take you to flight school

You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly?
Flight school

I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses
She be lookin fly like aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius
Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps its time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale
I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
Miguel. Gizelle. Dress fresh as hell
Louis. Gucci. Ye in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore
She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived livin like she died
Slide with a G, now she felt revived
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey
The LE, she never seen these

So the moment i might seize
I done come up out the coma of livin lifes dreams
When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team

Kanye West

I got my superman power, my superman cape
These the last hours, but superman late
The clock is ticking, damn can you wait?
Man, will he come back and save the day?
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse
Got to come by my head let, see if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away
Then we performed CPR
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I pimped my crib, so I must exhibit
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes
Get realized
I got the same wings angels fly
With Louie Vutton feathers, now that some fly shit

The next guest.. is my man
Bringing him back, its a pleasure to have him here
Please give it for my brother Kanye.. West

Uh.. Let me stop-by..
Now here goes the story...
She says "Baby, imma want you to put three rubbers cause I don't want no girl out there fucking up our money

I know a nigga payin' child support for one of his kids
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his!
Maaan! he killed that bitch, they gave him 25 years, 25 years
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..

Now I'm awake, sleepless in June

Hey hey hey hey

Don't say you will, I pray you will, I pray you will

Don't say you will, unless you will, I pray you will

Don't say you will

Don't, don't, don't, don't say

Keep the music on

This is a
This song was written for
A special moment in my life
Someone so special, that I love forever

And you know like, when you break up with somebody
And you have those times where you wanna see 'em again
And you're trying to make plans on a Friday night, in New York City
And you clear your whole schedule for this person, even though you're not together no more

'Cause there's nothing better than, someone you know and love
Even if you know you can't love them no more
You can't love them no more

Today, take presidents over anybody you dating or going out with or just hooking up with
And she knows who she is
To have someone so special in your life, that you're inspired by them
I ask myself, as I date
What am I looking for?
The requirement of this position is inspirement
The requirement is inspirement
And I am higher in
But also firing
Also firing, firing

I wanted to express that story better, it didn't come out as good as I wanted
Wasn't as poignant as I wanted to make it for my favorite story and for my ode to my loves

I walk through the halls of the school and it's cool to be known by many for my rapping ability
But what about the brothers who ain't got it like me
Making money off the trade
You could say I had it made
Drugs are on the rise
And it's not a big surprise
You see no soul in a young brother's eyes
Trying to be hard by the streets, but the streets kinda hard
But here's another factor we wanna disregard
Black-on-black is a stab in my back
It really hurts my soul when I hear about that

ALRIGHT

What's up Kanye what's up?

Woooooo

Mic check, mic check

I mean two platinum chains, was I on that?

New York City here! New York City here!

Its like, guess who's bizzack, back on the track with the blow
Kanye to-the, representing his gold
I guess who's come back, better than I suppose
Heard those beats, shit it's all I know
The Roc' is definitely in the building
Back on the track, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!
Damn, New York City in the house!
Talib Kweli gotta tell you what it's about
Because my man Kanye from the Chi' will say hi
Wave your hands from side to side

I say guess who's bizzack, Kweli, Kanye, and Mos
Punk niggas getting way too close
Doing Iving Plaza, causing disaster
You bring the time but we bring the prescription
Pick up your ears so you all could listen

Killing y'all niggas on this lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips

I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
Ok, Ok, Ok

Ok, ok, ok, ok
Ok, ok, ok

You move is like a Robocop
Somebody please make her stop

Somebody make her stop, stop
And we won't stop

I'd like to welcome everybody to VH1 storytellers
I go by the name of - Kanye, West
You could've been anywhere in the world this evening, but you wouldn't be as happy as you are right now
No, you wouldn't be as happy as you are right now

We're gonna run through some of the new songs and some of the old songs
And tell you where the whole thing went wrong, and tell you were the whole thing went wrong that forced me to write these songs
For my love, my love, my love
That spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl

Go ahead and stop it now

You know, I really like that part of the album
When I said
That was a good one, your first good one in a while
'Cause I love Tenacious D and I listen to them all the time
And I feel that was the closest I got to like a real Jack Black moment
And there was a lot more that I said, I said

We got to the movies and we laugh at different jokes
It went on and on and on and on

Spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl
Spoiled little LA girl, man I love these LA girls
These LA girls, man I love these LA girls

When did you become a Robocop?

Yo Monica, I know you shootin' that video in there
Aw, you just ain't gon' let me in the video, huh?
You know, I- like me and Missy we did this song
Together whatever
Um, okay, well

I can't keep knockin' and keep rockin' and keep poppin'
I keep droppin' and keep poppin' and keep rockin'
But I can't keep knockin' and keep knockin'
And keep poppin' and keep rockin'
Let's get it poppin'

So upset
This that hot shit
Uh huh, yeah
New Monica!

I'm the nigga that did the beat yo
You know we too old for this like Holyfield still boxin'
Ya will watch and I look back, ya still watchin'
What he got that I ain't got? I got Benz
I got rims, not 20s but I got 10s
Real real clean, come and get your rear wheel cleaned
She did what with who? Man I hear things
Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things
Up worryin' while she wore her ring
Now she got a fling and where's her ring?
Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now
Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now
And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now
She cuffed an NBA player from the first round
I grabbed her neck and made it hurt to breathe
She said "Security, this jerk could leave"

So do just what you want anytime that you really like
I put a payment on my place, you'll be sleepin' alone tonight
So don't you come knockin'

Knock knock knock, stop knocking
Don't come knocking at my do'
Ring ring ring, let the phone stop
I don't want you calling me no mo'

Yo this the remix, and I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Or you can call me Louis XIV
By the way cause I dropped out of the fourteenth grade

I used to be so gone
You were someone I could lean on
And I thought I couldn't breathe, ah ah
I see you put yo clean on
All night wanna be gone
I got a place and it's fixed up nice
I got company comin 'round fo'
So whoa whoa, haha, yeah

I don't want you callin' me no mo'
Don't come knocking at my door

And I can't keep knockin' and keep rockin'
Let's get it poppin' and that's stoppin'

What up Really Doe, I see you
You see I already got GLC up outta there
Aw we finna blow man
You know we got the game on smash
John Monopoly, Don C
Plain Pat what up?
Yeah, you know I got that boogie
And Jay boogie well
Yeah, what up Roc?
What up Tiffany, I see you

Changed my locks, took my things
Can't come in

Realest shit I ever wrote chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out homie I'ma make back
Can you believe it, whoa you gotta see it
I don't plan on going broke put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music
Martin Louis the King Jr
Starting, all that stuntin' is gonna ruin ya
B.I. was alive he probably had a two tone
With the Grey Poupon
Anything yay poop on
Will explode
Cause I am the shit and this is my commode
Uh oh there they go
Talking about how ya boy clothes extra tight
I just remember that my limelight extra bright
I hit the strip club and girls get extra hype
You hit the strip club and girls turn extra dyke
We know who not getting no sex tonight
And a lap dance will probably be a blessing right
So all the shit you talking dead, coffin
Light the weed coughing, new crib loftin'
Where it's at? Austin, where's that? Texas
What's in front? Benz's, what else? Lexus
Well who's Maybach is this? Mr. West's

Boss!
Kush burn like petroleum
Crib need custodians
Shades in all shades
These made erodium
Use to be the Oldsmo
Hoes call it oh low
Now I got so many horses
Bitches call me Polo
5762 tell me how ya wanna move
Yea you know I got them both
Beat your ass black and blue
I was barely getting pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Looking in the mirror I can see the real contender
Celery for even Gregory I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is ya telling me other than your gender
I'm a boss and I'm riding like a small fault
Niggas make your wheels and ride 'til they fall off yea Ross!

Well alright
All black Maybach
I'm sitting in the asshole
Classy as a mother still gutter like a bad bowl
Benjamin Franklin on x how the cash row
That's right them mill due like damn clothes
I eat ya mill too
We don't feel you
And we be strapping up like the navy seal do
Sweet as banana split every time I peel through
Fresher than will smith and uncle Phil too
Watching T-V in the Maybach in traffic
I'm on my feet like tough acting Tinactin
I'm running this shit
You should try tackling
Lil Wayne in one word immaculate
You see the Biggie, you see the Jay, the 2Pac in him
The Kurt Cobain, the Andre three stacks
And then I'm back to doing shit like I do sing Maybach music

AAAA!!!

For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
My money was number one draft pick
They still burned his jersey in Akron
If I don't get ran out by Catholics

Y'all can't keep playing with my emotions

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go DOWN
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control NOW
But there's nowhere to go NOW
And there's no way to slow DOWN
Runnin' outta time - movin' fast
So just sit back and enjoy the crash

And you know this, and you know this

What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard that's rapping
We might have to burn this whole suit down
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in

Keep it goin', keep it goin'

For you, baby, I'd find you

I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and Pac
Like Vida Guerra
Ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brains
You let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock
Picture that, like Megan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said "It's a wrap," she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs, like she Gloria Velez
She was eye candy in the Double X-L
Hopped off the page and on the skateboard with Pharrell
And all these new video bitches tryin' be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind close doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards
Ha ha

Fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are
Put your hands up, ladies
If you kept your legs closed
But you know
I wrote this song for you
For all y'all

Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes
Did I have under my belt, like boxers?
Not to brag, but, if it add up, one, two
Nigga, that's mad nuts
Game, you mad nuts
How you gonna call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gonna call me?
The only dream of the ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from a team
Head so good, he don't ask for a prenup'
Now ask your self this question, uh
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O?
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove an E-O?
Would you ride with Ne-Yo if he was in a Geo?
Well, why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me for?
But since they all fall in my palm, I'll take a trio

Put your hands up, baby
If you kept your mouth closed
For you, and you

I done have my share of bitches with long hair
Short 'do like Kelis, a Halle, and boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in a Bentley, drop top
On Miami Beach, when Lil' Kim was fuckin' with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She let you spray in her face as long as you Bathin' Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Super Head, fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stab you in the stomach
She must a had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit, fly as Gabrielle Union
In the back off my six, fo' Impala
Forget the double D's, I put 'em right in your face
Like that model bitch De Cara
And she ain't win the show, but she ridin' in that Gelatta
That's why I fuck 'em today then forget 'em tomorrow

God damn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I was sittin' back and watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhyme's video
Then I flipped the motherfuckin' channel, checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg's video
And I see the same bitch that was in MY video
You know what I'm sayin'?
And then, you know what I'm sayin', to make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' Oprah coverin' Hurricane Katrina
I see the same bitch on Oprah, floatin' away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the nigga Lil' Weezy video
I mean, damn! Everywhere I look, everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah

Oh you know
I just want you to know

'Its your boy Kanye West on the beat.'
'Eh, White Boy!'

This boy here can flow
South side up in here
West side up in here
East side up in here
Throw your hands in the air

Kanye West is the name South side up in here
Ya'll niggers stole the show
Ya'll niggers all some clones
Ya'll need to change ya'll tone
Nigga I control the gold
Muthafucker close the door
Light the weed and let the odor blow
Why you keep balling old girl
You ain't been around hoes before?
Why my chain rosy gold?
Why my wrist below zero?
How the hell I know B-Lo?
Why them girls figure no means no?
Green means paper dream team capper
We see ya haters like shorty on the sixes
Ya'll finna see some dead people
Come through your block and egg people
My people ain't scared people
Only fear God, yeah people

Caught for presackin the fifth and we got them gats in here
White Boy got them thangs
White Boy a hot damn shame
White Boy hot like Mars
Ya'll flow hot like marsh
Ya'll can't stop these bars
White Boy top these charts
White Boy got the ball
Lyrics gon' shock you boy
Chris don't cop them cars
Get a couple foxy broads
Out there shoes, socks, and bra
This is not so hard
Chris gotta Rocky heart
Pimp with the mobster walk
Chris got hostile thoughts
Ya'll better watch it ya'll
Midwest rock you ya'll!

Brat prophet
Black gothic
Slash comic
Rats jockin
Fat pockets
Mad hoppin
Crack poppin
Stacks droppin
Can't stop it
Weights knocking
Hate in your face
Watching base
On relate
Gossip facin
I make options
Incase I catch a case
Gots to pay
Confrontate
Need to break
From this place
If this ain't the way Kanye
Then its straight colleges
In your veins
Cuz you spent
What you gain
From straight knowledge
I was raised in the street
Praisin my heat
Holdin on my Nextel
Hopin for the next El
Focused on the best sell
Smokin on the fresh El
Posted like Fed Ex mail

Now that you're tuned in
I suggest you zoom in
And claim Puff dead
I'm out the tomb then
I'm married to the game like the bride and the groom is
If you don't want to move then leave the room here
See you the type of nigga believe the rumors
But I'm the type to show y'all what the truth is
And show you how the coupe is
And you don't know where the roof is
And the interior is stupid
So I'mma shoot my shot and just do it
Cause I can't stop my love for the music
Been a decade since Biggie dropped "Juicy"
When I think back sometimes I still lose it
And feel the ambiance
From the screams of the audience
And y'all response

I'mma give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we
Gonna give it everything I got, just to stay on top

Cause we can't stop, and you don't stop, cause you can't stop
What's up, rap world
I figured I'd take this opportunity to look outside of myself and say
What would I say if I was them

9-1 Heavy D, 9-2 Mary J
No more Uptown
Bad Boy on the way
9-3, 9-4 B.I.G.'s in the door
9-5 making hits, Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique
Craig Mack, "Flava in Ya Ear"
Don't stop there, Lil' Kim posing in the panties and a brassiere
Sayin' "Biggie Biggie give me one more chance
"Biggie Biggie give me one more chance" ah man
Fly chicks, rolling in fly whips
9-6 Bad Boy invented the remix
These hits got the whole world loving my clique
They loving the sound
The whole world hitting my hit
9-7 Big passed and he went up to heaven
Only on the second album he already a legend
Man I wish Big could've seen the world in '07
Matter of fact sometimes I wish I just died with him

I miss him
He's still part of me

This a classic just add this to the rest of them

Everyday and all night
Mase is back it's gon' be alright
See I know what y'all like
Holla back its gon' be alright
For real its gon' be alright
Mase is back its gon' be alright

Mase said come on, Mike said shamone
Let's start it up early like Raven Symone
Keisha Knight Pull, Emanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothing handed at all, but did I complain
Every time magazines tried to taint mine name
But y'all can't hold me down like restraint
I took the "t" up out the word can't
Around the same time Nas said I can
Bush was sending our fam to Iran
I'm in the club with Henny, ass in my other hand
Lord please forgive me I'm just a man
Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments
'Fore they do me like they did Janet adjusting them
Me and my cousin them, trying to rap like Busta and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I ain't never ever accept no money
From these so called sponsors
They was in Benzs, I was in Hondas
Now I'm wondering where they all at like a nonda
Hmm, that's something to ponder
The money y'all make on this one's for Donda
That's West to you
You the next, I can't hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it some decibels
And put some more zeros in front of that decimal, nigga!

That's why its gon' be alright

Arm froze and all, Dom Rose and all
Maserati, Bugatti, the roads and all
Different color Louis open toes and all
I tried to tell the chicks don't expose it all
Country dude's mouth full of golds and all
Bay area chicks, cornrows and all
I do it right I do my wife, I leave the hoes to y'all
Close the boutique, I might close the mall
I wave the Rollie you wave the Seiko
Need I say more, more diamonds than LisaRaye
I'm no replica, I am the DNA
Breeze through leave you like the  hurricane
Somebody get killed the whole borough blamed
M-A dollar what a thorough name
No matter who come through I'm forever the king
I should've never left the game its what a kiddie say
Still chicks throwing me up like newly weds
I'm grown and sexy done with groupie head
In the milk white Phantom, the seats are ruby red
You hear the rumor listen to the facts
I drive my cars in pairs like pity pat
When I drop the track it feel like Biggie back
The game is country I came to bring the city
I came, I came to bring the city back

For real put your hands up
GOOD Music put your hands up
Bad Boy put your hands up
Roc-A-Fella put your hands up
Chi-Town put your hands up
NY put your hands up
Miami put your hands up
Texas put your hands up
Tennessee put your hands up
London put your hands up
Japan put your hands up
All around the world, all around the world
LA put your hands up
ATL put your hands up
Man this gon' be...

Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke, broke

She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm
And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
And I gotta take all they bad a---- to ShowBiz
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you f------ with this girl then you better be paid
My best friend said she used to f--- with Usher

Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke n-----, uh

She got one of yo' kids, got you for eighteen years
You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money
Yeah, it's something that you need to have
When she leave your a-- she gon' leave with half
And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke n-----. uh

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, you gotta roll up ya sleeves
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And y'all gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' a-- for a white girl

And that is the story of the Gold Diggers, boys and girls

Oh you didn't think we can it again

The way, we mode em right
Girl I see you, in them apple bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon, 0-4 Range
Still sexy, when you smoke that flame
Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky, so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me, you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight
You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights, when you take a bath
You got, such a sensational ass
I'ma get you Jimmy Chew, and Ma Baker bags
I can cop her, a 2000 and 3
Make her smile, when she sees Spre's
I can get you on cd's, and DVD's
Take you to BB's, and PCBG
I can get you in the places, to be into
The people to know or show you things, sticker than to
I wanna be your lover, undercover Don
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can rich your blood
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see you in some Gucci, or Erika Vali
And I bet she gon put a hurt on em, hard in the party
And you know you kill em in the club, we go
You was born to be a po', how you gon sticking fo' do's
And I love you, cause you freaky with the dope clothes
Drop it to the flo', let it go when you roll slow
And I love it, when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me, and have a brother going oh-oh
Girl I love, how you roll me right
I can make you, a celebrity overnight
You see, see baby girl
You see how you make a brother break down
I just gotta ask you, what you need
What you need from me, oh you wanna be a star
Are you messing with the right one
I can take you there, I can make sure
You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager
Come here girl, I could see you bored
Took you to the queen, that I see you for

We could do, plenty things plus more
I'm about to have you, change in the stores
I can even get you, to the Soul Train awards

Hey yo, y'all niggas don't want it

A lot of speculation about the money I've made, me and Just Blaze
How are they fo'real, are them niggas really paid?
Rappers I've met or dealt with direct
Can he really master depths who check by check
And 'H to the IZZO' only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella should fold and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?
For the millionth time, askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassin' me
Like you don't care about my son's feelin's
I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard 'Takeover', who runnin' this rap shit?
Eww fake tits
Shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take Six
What'chu doin' in L.A. with 50 Cent and Dr. Dre?
Didn't one them niggas have beef with Jay?
We doin' this shit for entertainment
Brings guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber let one up out the chamber

And after that I'ma buy a couple buildin's

Uh, I don't need no little ass
I need a ghetto ass girl
With a car that can make it 'cross town with just a little gas
I know when we first met, you was a little gassed
But you want to keep your swag
So you was holding back
Your little brother love me
He say, "Yeezy got some fresh clothes"
Your grandmother love me
Cause I always dress in dress clothes
I can switch your dress code
Change your life like, "presto"
I am like that Aston Martin engine, you just press "go"
Why you acting like you ain't impressed for
Oh, see why you listen to the press though?
I ain't finna explain my life up on no Larry King
Cause when I show her that thing
She said, "that explains everything"
That just changed everything
Yeezy on her name ring
Yeezy where her chain bling
Yeah, I throw Barack up, but
Baby, you get my vote
Love a ghetto girl with more ass than the models

See, see, see I did the screwed up shit myself
I ain't put no affect, no

Ay, ay, ay gonna thump 'm thump
When I thump I'm thumpin' on the old game
I can thump, thump, do some, something 'till they sold me
Turn that bitch to a Soul Train
I'll get a thump with the old stain
Want to just slap that cocaine
Like a cold king, someone who just sound like, "okay"
Okay, I get it, I pound it, I spit it, now I'm throwin' up
I'm gonna, wanna something, 'till I got my moana
And then I'm gonna....

Are grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love, and--and--they're going-- they're channeled
In a different way

Blatantly see like, "Wow, the "Yeezys" did really good. He was this influential. All those albums did this. But we're not gonna give him

And all i could show him was pictures of my cribs
And all i got was a brand new sports car

Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo

Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But i couldn't hear 'em all the way in first class
Look back on my life and my life gone... where did I go wrong?

I can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it

I seen it

But I couldn't figure out who I wanna take
Bad enough that i showed up late

I can't stop having these visions I gottaget with it
I can't keep having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoooo

And I, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
Can't stop having these visions

Yeah Yeah
Class Heat
I'm the shit
Yeah Baltimore Club Music
Yeah I'm The shit
I got them diamonds on my neck
Got Patron in my cup
If you wanna come and get it
Shawty I don't give a f*ck
See it's Friday night
And I just got paid
I done had a hard week
Now it's time To Celebrate
Well the DJ played my shit
Some of that club music shit

Back it all up on my d*ck
See it's on tonight
Trying to leave with something right
I'm a grown ass man
So Shawty you can spend the night

Cause I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch

I got a crib down the hill
And we on Reistertown
Girl I'm hardly ever home
Because I'm always out of town
Is that your girlfriend
I really like her
Her booty's fat like yours
I know the club is bout to close
But it's only 3 o'clock
They hating and they hating
Cause I got this thing on lock
Why the two baddest bitches in the club
Going home with me

See now I'd probably been in this shit the longest
I don't deal with the fake and the phoniest
Girls treat me like I'm one of the Jones's
Give her dick and all types of bonuses
I don't really even know who song this is
But I heard it and jumped right on this shit
If the shoe fit you better wear it
And I swear it you see me

She asked me what my name is
Told her I was famous
You don't know who Jermaine is
She must be brainless
Since the day I came in
Don't know where them lames went
But that ain't no issue
Baby get your boy some tissue

Fish you as my whistle
Got your chick she doesn't miss you
She'll be with you when she kiss you
She'll be licking on my missile
No homo see my logo
And you'll hold shows like it's promo
It's tight I had to force it
Now they call me porcelain

What's the best form of genocide?
Black-on-black crime
Cause I guess it takes up less of they time
What's the best form, best, best form of genocide?
Cause I guess it takes up less time
Now, if you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
If you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
Then we'll have more time to make real figures
And we can still keep it lookin' at them like
"Damn, look at those real niggas
With they chains and they cars, but they still niggas"
Cause soon as a nigga gets it
Then another nigga wants to get it
Soon as another nigga has a girl
Then another nigga wants to hit it, admit it
Soon as a nigga has a crib
They want to break into that nigga crib
See where he live, see what he did
And don't wanna do the same shit he did to get that crib
Get it? You know, when niggas is killin' niggas
What's amazin' to me
What don't phase me is when niggas try to call me crazy
Cause they don't phase me
Cause I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people don't think
See, I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people just don't think
Now picture this; now if I show up onto this motherfucker
And express myself creatively
They always want to say, "He's crazy, see"
And when they so distressed
What would be the best thing to write?
Yes, now maybe that can take away from the way
I kick them niggas ass on 12/12/12
Maybe that can take away
Nah, nah, nigga, they seen it, these niggas seen it theyself
Well, and my grandfather ninety-seven
He said, "I ain't never seen you get down like that"
He ain't give a fuck about the kilt, this dress
Whatever the fuck they call it
You see, niggas killin' niggas
You can't see through the fog
With all the negativity that they write on a blog
I give a fuck about what somebody think
If that person doesn't think
It's too early in the conversation anyway
You know, they say, "You should be embarrassed
You should be embarrassed, you a nigga
How the fuck you gonna show your clothin' line in Paris?"
You should be embarrassed, you should be
Didn't you read the reviews, the press?
I don't give a fuck, I guess
I don't give a fuck, no, it's not that I don't give a fuck
It's that I give most of the fuck and I'm not givin' up
And it's not that I'm crazy, no, that's a lie
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
And I would die for what I believe in
When I see that, uh, just a change what y'all receivin'
Do you all receive us? Do y'all believe it? It's too much
Okay, there's someone they can't touch
How 'bout some integrity from your favorite celebrity?
That's me, that's me, niggas killin' niggas
"Why he do that? Why he wear that?
Why he say that? Where he play it?
Oh, my God, nigga, niggas
It's bad enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough
But you can never say I didn't give my heart enough
And if we did somethin' good
And we didn't say, "Oh, excuse me. Pardon us"
Then they want to throw niggas back
On, on, on the retarded bus
And when they riot in the streets
They gon' say, "What, what the fuck started us?
And made 'em start it up?"
And look at me like I ain't smart enough
And everybody got a suggestion and a lesson
And a question and a stress
And then they always want to stress a man, uh
And say, "Maybe he's too aggressive", or, uh, well
Maybe the shit you doin' is just not impressive to a nigga
So let me make this clear
It won't be long 'til y'alls get more of what y'all gettin' right here
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout nobody comin' to Atlantic City
Talkin' 'bout, "Oh, it's just a casino show"
Or, "It's just New Years, so we can't do nothin' really creative"
No, I'm talkin' about a motherfucker workin' every day
From four o'clock in this buildin'
Readjustin' all these fuckin' cameras
To make this show better and better
Better every night for y'all
And all they can say, "He got a mask on. He crazy"
But they just tryin' to fuckin' deter you
From what you are seein' in front of you
This is "Jesus Walks", this is "Can't Tell Me Nothing"
So maybe let this time open up your mind
And let you know that you can do anythin' in life
Yeah, baby, you can shine
This right here lets you know you can do anythin' in life
With enough time and focus and focus and time and time
And don't let nobody tell you
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique, so here
Since they'll probably put this online
Let me make this shit real clear
Michael Jackson died from a lack of information
From motherfuckers bein' around him lyin' to him
Actin' like shit okay, but I'm a find the information
Don't believe nothin' that they say
Don't matter who you look up to
Don't take more than ninety percent of what the fuck they say
Cause they are not you
And that extra ten percent is what makes you you
So you do what the fuck you want to do
And if somebody tell you you can't do it
Be like, "Man, who the fuck are you?"
You only got one life that you know about, you only got
And time is somethin' you can never get back
Most important thing
Don't forget that time is somethin' that you never can get back
So don't forgot that cause the money could go
And you could spend it over and over
And over and over, over, over, oh
And the cars could crash
And now did that tell me, "What do you have?"
And the house can burn down
And whose your real friends when you turn around?
Yeah, that's your clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do like my clique
And all these bad ladies

Niggas can't be serious, man
Yo, yo

Yo I'm the reason metal detectors go off the meter
'Cause I'll run through the airport with the heater
Gets the fag at his plane, and if I miss him
Put two in his brain at the baggage claim
Give him... heavy sluggage, tryna get his luggage
Send him to the crossroads, we way too thuggish
Shit, we at odds 'til we even up
'Til you leave on a stretcher or I leave in cuffs
Niggas wanna live, they done breathed enough
And I bet you next time they'll believe in us
It don't take much brains to know we bust things
My gat must bang, through your Mustang
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Niggas seen Kanye, red dotted them
Hurry up, stash the guns, the cops gon' come
And we gon' say we don't know who shot at 'em

Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas

Y'all niggas ready for war? I'm ready
Easy with the clip, girl, hold it steady
Man I'm 'bout to squeeze back, cock and bust hot lyrics
Cock back, pop, and touch y'all spirits
Send 'em to hell, make their residence more evil
This beat here make me wanna kill four people
Three niggas and one hoe, turn bitches to Jane Doe
Send 'em past rainbows, with the ankles
Hit 'em from all angles, bring the pain though
Blow out the candles, the show's been cancelled
Man, y'all niggas better believe somethin'
'Fore I squeeze somethin' and leave somethin'
It ain't nothin' with my real niggas

I feel like one lady, five babies and four fathers
Six months searchin' for jobs and no offers
No heat 'cept for the stove
Sleep with two layers of clothes, still wakin' up cold
I'm real, like AIDS
Like the pain you feel when your nigga get strained
That's why I got issues like I got pistols
I gotta make your mama cry but I got tissues
I confess, I'm a gangsta
But I drop my flag, still cock back and drop a fag
Leave him in a bag with a tag on his metatarsals
Awfully ill, man, awfully real
Thugged out, but I'm God's property still
And if I up the steel, I'ma probably kill
If not, you're paralyzed from the waist down
Alright dog, you're the king? I'm the ace now
Face down

Get this cash with my real niggas

We got the remix
It's another hot exclusive from the dominators

Flashing lights, lights
What do I know?
Know

Pharmaceuticals bought me charm like the jeweler jewels
Squares of ice shed light like the Rubix cube
I get it mixed up, red with the blues
And she all mixed up, admirin' the hues
Four years later, niggas admirin' your shoes
Bape year late, we call you Tokyo buffoons
'Cause stylists admire us, look at how you groom
Keep runnin' to SoHo, them exclusives in my room
Niggas is biters, we let you slide with your writings
We knew that cocaine talk was not like you
But who goes as far as tryin' to dress like him?
One sequin glove can never make you Michael
I moonwalk over tracks and make niggas spiteful
But never hear a word 'cause them niggas know
That my flow so viper and if Pusha go psycho
He'll seance that pen and pull your spirit up out yah, P

I'm so literary with it, you can tell how I write
The boy such an author, I should smoke a pipe
Rockin' an ascot, the coupe with a glass top
17 inch rims makin' the ass drop
I was in the spot from the first to the fifth
With a mean comeback like The Return of the Sith
Like ridin' a bike, never you forget
Still I got it for cheap, whether you smoke or you sniff
The gift is the curse and vice versa
To remove me off that horse takes more than a merger
Durin' that hiatus I was with the natives
Then back to the States, pass along the savings
Put it in the street, caterin' the cravings
Like the second-comin', got the fans awaitin'
Victory is sweet, even amongst the hatin'
Find me on that beach, island in the Caymans, gone

As you recall, you know I love to show off
What do you know?
Know...

Or I make the life
I was very rich
Already

But if I think back to when I was making the College Dropout, thinking was this what I expected?
I mean, I didn't expect the losses and you expect everything to work out well
But I expected real life
And then I suffered the worst pains to help me to grow
So those experiences, I never ask to take them away from me
Because they're all in God's plan and help make me the man I am today
And help make me more of a soldier and a vessel
Because if I hadn't suffered those losses, I might be scared or too scared to fight the war on traditional thinking

And if you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, like we always do at this time

Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I, gotta go for mine, I gots to shine
Imma get on the TV momma and I'mma
Yo, I'mma put shit down

Welcome to the good life, where homies who sell D
Man, they say the best things in life are free
It feel like L.A. it feel like Miami
Ahhhhh! Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
Y'all pop the trunk,I pop the hood - Ferrari
And she got that ass, I got to look - sorry!

Yo it's gots to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks - Lawry's
And if they hate then let 'em hate, watch the money pile up

Welcome to the good life! Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
The good life, it feel like Philly
It feel like D.C. it feel like D.C
Ayy!
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood?
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would
But, but, I don't think he should

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin some brain
Havin money's not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst, but when I get my card back
I always had a passion for flashin
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined

Everybody wants the good life
Welcome to the good life
When I though that I was gonna go crazy

Yo, this that shit
Just to let niggas know
You can't fuck with us

But I don't even wanna hit on you, don't wanna know his name
Sit down nigga, I know the game
Clothes shopper, I know the game
Take it and put it back into the store
Crazy cat, ah
And I don't wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed

Got me talkin bout love, you mean forever
You mean me falling in love, talking never
She's missing me after this one chick got together
She told me she had a man but they not together
Let me tell you how I first met her
It's kinda ill though
I'm downtown tryna find Anita
That's where I find this diva stand in front the hospital
I double park the car, scream, yo man's not with you
As for the cigarettes just brought the convo what went on
I man up and eat, her belly holdin on
And as far as she say
Oh that was over, he say she say
So you telling me your man stayed up in micro weeds
Mistaken identity like Cochise and I'm finna be
Holla at you now, know we'll talk later
And I wanna get up but you got flavor
Now I'ma let you get the cell, let you get the pager
And if you ain't around no haters you can call me later

I know the game, I know the game
Y'all know the game
Cause we know the game

She must've known where the dollars at
Cause it ain't taken long at all but need to holla back
Gave me directions to the crib, told me follow that
And I could park in back where the Impala at
But she ain't stayed on the southside, south southside
Deeper than the know when
Now I'm questioning whether I should get in that
Plus lasting a lot, walk into the door, haters asking a lot
And where you from nigga? You ain't from round here
As I peeped out the window said baby I'm right here
He mad cause I'm with her and he ain't with her
And he stayed down the hallway and he can't get er
So when I came out the nigga hatin on me was waitin on me
And he had mo guys, no lie
Man I knew we were both wrong, bitch but I know nothing
Finna wear both chains but I know nothing

Wake up, Mr. West!

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah

Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, Like Tim, it's a Hardaway
Till this is in the name of love, like Robert say
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer aids
Abu Akhbar be throwin' some hot cause
Things we seein' on the screen not ours
But these niggas from the hood, so these dreams not far
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it, uh

And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
But we'll find a way

Adam Levine
And nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest baby
It hurts, but it may be the only way

They say people in your life for seasons
And niggas gun-clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
It's alive, I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, sick of it now

And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today

And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest, baby

One thing that makes me mad is when people get foolish
On Halloween, people start to feel like they're kinda ghoulish
Comin' into my face, sayin' "Hey can I get a picture?
Can I get a picture of you and your son?" and I say "Hold on, I don't want one"
Step back, get away, give me my space
Wait, give me my space, because I may Chris Brown you and punch you dead in your motherfuckin' face
Because I don't like people comin' into my category, into my area
Because they cause mass hysteria
It gets scarier, or should I say it's scary
Because I can hit high notes, kick in your nuts like Mariah Carey
And that's the way it is, so those things make me mad
When my momma passed away, that was the thing that made Big Boy really sad
We're talkin' about mad, we're talkin' 'bout gettin' frustrated
We're talkin' about before me and my girl got married, before we dated
We're talkin' about when people say things about my momma or my family
You can't do that to me, because you can't trust me
Now I'm Ida's son, Keith's brother, Sheila's brother, Kenny's brother
Sharell's brother, Nicole's brother, Sharnice's brother, a whole lot of brothers
But anyway, let me get back on topic
That's the way it is when I kick freestyles, let me stop it
So Kanye, you're here
What makes you mad? Make it clear
I'm fallin' off, let me put my shoes back on, let me tie 'em up
Kanye, here you go, brother, could you please fill up our cup?

Uh, I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you're gonna turn to Tyson
Paparazzi, I'm like a nazi to 'em
More like the next Sinatra to 'em
Uh, ayo I got to ruin
Ayo, before I lose it, and have to prove it
This the way that we gon' do it, time we gotta move it to the future
Kamasutra
Any way that suit yah
Don't shoot yah
Stop the violence and it's been stopped
Uh, we stopped the violence in the hip-hop
Uh, we stopped the hatin' and the degredation
Uh, we 'bout to build like one nation
Uh, got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn, like Ice Cube said
Uh, I'm the rudest
Lot of people say that, cause they say Ye don't play that
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye juice
Uh, that's the way I stay loose
Uh, my crib spacial
Uh, my relationship is interracial

You can't categorize me, you can't put me in a box
I'm the ox that rocks, bagels and locks
Learn what you're eatin', learn the menu
Cause I continue to send freestyles through your denu
Or should I say I dim you, down like a lightswitch
That's the way it is, Big Boy, you know I'm not a yitch
I gotta go 'head and censor myself
And if you look into my pocket, I'm a little bit of wealth
But anyway, Ida's son, the real McCoy
Ida's son, the homies, they call me Big Boy
I had to drop 7-10 cause it's Kanye West day
In the neighborhood, Power 106, it's all good
That's the way it is, I think you should
Let me get back on, because I'm fallin' off again
Let me kick my volume way past 10
'Because it's Ida's son, the B-I-G
Big Boy's in the house, in the place to be
I don't know why I'm saying these old simple last rhymes
But anyway, I'm Kickin back with some friends of mine
That's louis, E-man, and Kanye, Can't Forget Ricky
That's the man that's on the microphone
Thats the man thats on the turntables, Willing and able

I don't where to start, I don't where to start
Maybe the, Maybe the flow
Maybe the 'Go, where i was grow
Where I grew up in, Where you could see
When we was three, in the cold
Straight from Chicago, where I go
And everybody know
From my homie Don C, I be eh
Ay yo, like IBM
Or Apple Steve Jobs, or this
Ay yo its very very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel
I can do it in every tempo, I use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build Churches
That could be as big as the Adams Family, where it lurches
Ay yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed motherfucker
Ay yo, it ain't no
No cursing in the versing, what you know is not perfect
And you know its still worth it
I might short circuit
I might just blackout
Hit you with that blakka, you know I'm the rocker
Number one Chief rocker, Number one Chief rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop em', ain't nobody gon' stop us because
I got God on my side, thats the way I ride
Jesus  Christ
Yeezus Christ
Yeezus nice

But not quite cause you cut off my lights
But how'd you'd get there

So good night, I'm headed out the door..
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road

You do you and I'm just gon' be fine

That you know, ohhh

You like to ride, uh
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?
I don't know what happened, it's just like

Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish rosed it up
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two Gs

Ooh, you so boozy, boo, you could've fooled me
'cause five years ago, you was so Fugees

You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell but not Nokia

It be goin' in and out like a robbery, ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Robin Geeda
Then I'ma take you to the house like Trick and Trina

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade?
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things, let's fly away

Malik Yusef, bet your baby, momma know the name
I give you words, spit with flames

But my job was to hustle dro

And I no longer like you, fuck it
Now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to?

Not knowin' you was trife, stiflin' a nigga's growth

The sex is good but you ain't a shooter
It ain't in your direction, so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways
Goin' wild like West and Kanye

Goddamnit, I'm grown
Broke broad, I'ma leave your ass alone

My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly

Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox
Now let's go
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my mama hopped in the U-Haul van
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment
Least about an hour I would stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world

I would do anything to say "I got it,"
Before anybody wanted K-West beats
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane
I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to write my wrongs

'Fore the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl!
Testify, come up in the spot
Looking extra fly

Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the Third
Here like ear till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's
I'm back on the block like a man on the street
I'm trying to stop Lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat
Engarde, Touche Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car
Now, let me end my verse right where the horns are like

We back at home, baby
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, Sky high
Yeah!
Keep it rollin'
Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!

Cause I can't wait much longer
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now

When the fast life takes its tole
That act right makes everything slow
Them black lights make everything glow
One of those nights where everything goes
Everybody goes through something
People be talking to you like you nothing
Then you be like bitch I'm me
Then your boss be like bitch then leave
You covered up your tats too long with them sleeves
You've gotta hit the club let the real you breathe
Would you believe, you'll never shine if you're not seen
So get all in they face like Noxzema
I know you mesmerized about that ass in them jeans
Please don't hit that raw, it's not clean
Please don't forget that all when it seems

I ask, cause I'm not sure
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
'Specially in my Pastel, on my Bape shit
New Gospel homie, take 6, and take this, haters

If God put me in ya plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
Uh, baby you're makin' it

Down

'Til we lose control, system overload

So keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - you lose

I can't keep my-self, and still keep you too
No more wasting time, we can't wait for life

But I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I'm bout to go, I don't need you

So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown

Is anybody in the house right now in love right now?
In love right now, well keep your love lockdown
If anybody in the house right now is in love right now
Try your best to keep your love lockdown
Keep your love lockdown
Keep it on

Is it better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all?

This brings us to the end of my VH1 Storyteller
Thank you for
Being my shrink today and the stage as my couch
Thank you for allowing me to get some things off my chest and out of my mind
The ghosts out of my head so they will not haunt me at night
And just for this moment as I hear clap and hear you scream, just for this moment
I feel alright

My pain shall be your pleasure, my torment and tragedy

Where's the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Running for the finish line
You run for the finish line
I'm not ready to fi-finish life
But I'm on the finish line
So I run from the finish line
I run from the finish line
'Cause I'm not ready to finish life
I gotta run from the finish life

So keep your love lockdown, so keep your love
You keep your love
We're low

Not loving you, way I wanted to
Screaming, "No, no, no, no, no, noo
So I keep it low, keep a secret cold

So keep your love lockdown

You keep your love lockdown and you lose

Is anybody in the house right now that's in love right now?
You gotta keep your love locked down, you gotta keep your love
Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me
Please, please, promise me
Please, promise me, please
That you will keep your love lockdown
Just try to keep your love lockdown

You don't want to make the music
I'm forced to make right now
I know it sounds good and all
But I would rather have my love lockdown
That number one hit don't mean shit
If it's nobody to celebrate with
To celebrate with, to levitate with

You gotta keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown

Left, right, right, left
We go left, right, right, left
C'mon left, right, right, left
We gon tighten up our boots and march till it ends, c'mon
We gon tighten up our boots and march till it ends

This a story about a bad girl that used to be good
A miseducation of Lauren that stayed in the hood
See she probably could have made it in Hollywood
But she was misguided, misled, and misunderstood
She wanted her baby dad with good hair like Blair Underwood
And push a whip with 12 cylinders under the hood
Now she got 6 kids to feed under her roof
She didn't want her daughters to end up in the same position
So she named one hope named the other ambition
But the problems with poverty left them with no choice
Then one got locked
Then one got popped
Don't worry Mom

The Roc is in the building

Homgirl Mela

So I don't miss a thing

Hear barbershop talk, niggas want to kill him
Throw my hoodie on, blend in like chameleons
Take my hoodie off, they like "What up Ye, you chillin'?"
Just like Halloween, minus the costumes
The nigga that's flickin' be the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' be the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationships, everybody cheatin'
I used to want the Jordans most recent
Throw Jordans on the truck now just to look decent

Since you went away
Southside serenade

South-south-southside
Southside
South-southside

So glad to be alive

Til the casket drops
Third times a charm right?
Ha ha, come on!

I'm kinda like a big deal
It's unbelievable you see my warning gives you big chills
The flow runnin' on Big's heels
My life after death, Big ain't get to see how this feels!
Third time's a charm baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessin' to blow a hundred thou' in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha ha we're ballin, drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin'
Re-up is the gang and I'm all in!
To the powder and the flame I have fallin'
Get money, blow money is my callin'
Yugch! Watch a nigga burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push!

They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

Ay yo I'm sittin' on top of the
It's more than a feeling ain't it?
I be killin' damn it, I'm illin' I'm illin'
Eh eh eh meet Mr. Popular
Go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be
Spittin' fire on the P-J in my P-J's
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like T-J
Y'all ain't peep? I said Marshall's we play
I guess I'm like the Black Marshall meets Jay
Meet Ye' alligator souffle, had it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in Special Ed
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
What happen Tisha, your boyfriend cum fast?
Turn around gimme pound like we folks
Hell no I went raw dog three strokes

Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction!
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I bee hop in the ring, niggas ya cash in
It's like stoppin' a train
Nigga think he's stoppin' my reign
Talk slick while droppin' my name?
I'm puttin' y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits I ex out the middle man
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentle-man, introducin'
The C-4-S with the rims protrudin'
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me lookin' to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe
But just as you reap, so shall you so

Right. Okay so you're letting them know, leave me alone.

You just popped in the Lil Jon remix of "The Workout Plan", and
And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
And here come the 5 to the 7 and 6
I dropped out of college, I can't count worth shit
When the album dropped I was dissing this
Now everybody know this the shit
Part 2, this the update
The second rule is so underrated
They claim the song was so degradin'
"But shit it's still my favorite
And he ain't talkin' 'bout me though"
Hello, then who I'm talking about, people?
OK, whatever you want to believe though
And I even took my own advice
This gut ain't nothing these hoes gon' like
I said, I look like LL
Took my shirt off, sheclaimed "I can't tell"
But never said I can't sell
Pat, where we at, 3 mil?
Who the best now?
OK leave me out of it
Tell me who the rest now?

They call me the twista, now work that Motha'Fucka
But not to hard, baby you can do what you do
So, its crush time, Shawty show me you can do so
Gon' Work it, put down the philly steaks
I know you love how my lexus ride
But get them with them legs, don't flex them thighs
You know want it, don't testify
Try my New Workout Plan called Sex-ercise
That's real
You don't wanna go a day without me
She don't really wanna lay without me
I know you love when i'm workin' it in now, baby we can work it out

All day at they fitness party
It's upside down that for the A-Town
What...y'all...sayin?
Yes I'm just gonna...stand...and watch you dance from over here

Work it out, work it out, girl

Yo Ferris, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
If this ain't dedication I don't know what is, man
Listen, first of all I want to thank you for your support

Uh, yeah, feels like, uh, every sunshine is brighter
Sunsets feel righter
Feel like God wrote this
I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you notice but them accident pictures were bogus
Cuz that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
Man, I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I go on Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throw in some vowels
Girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident they tellin' me it's the cheeks
And if you look at history
'Cept I'm comin' from the Chi
Through the wire to the wall
All of them could of been lost
Heck naw, that boy is raw

You hear that? That's all that jewelry I got on man
Sometimes I take it off at the airport but I still get stopped
They be like "There go Kayne, there go Kayne!
Can I see some I.D. please? So thank you very much"
First of all, my momma named me Kanye so y'all gon' call me Kanye
I'm like the girl on the 'Sixth Sense'
"I'm feelin' much better now"
I feel a whole hell of a lot better man

Hahahaha
Your loss

'Cause niggas got cocaine to move

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

This the greatest shit in the club
Since "In da Club"
She say, "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say, "Can you get my Benz in the club?"

Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me "don't touch me"
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
Niggas give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said "I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes"
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said "Ye' you don't love me"
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper
We showin' you the good the bad the ugly

Just me and you girl

Aren't you a sight for red eyes

Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
But you play it off and say, "How is work baby?"
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
Quote unquote, "Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends."
On the phone, hollin' that "niggas is whatever"
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress."
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no that's a shame
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far."
Well we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herds, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot

Yo, we at war
Most of all we at war with ourselves
God, show me the way because
The Devil's trying to break me down
You know what the Midwest is? Young & Restless
Where restless niggas might snatch your necklace
And next these niggas might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor, the view alone and leave you breathless, uhh
Try to catch it, uhh, it's kinda hard
Getting choked by the detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying, aWe eat pieces of shit like you for breakfasta
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us
Well momma, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope
The only thing that I pray
Is that me feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing
I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid
'Cause we ain't spoke in so long
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
Because we ain't spoke in so long, so long, so long
To the hustlas, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
To the victims of welfare, for we living in hell, here hell, yeah
Now hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cuz we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers as role models, we rap, we don't think
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way y'all need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well, let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club
Everybody screaming out

Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This nigga...why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack as nigga..

Wack niggas...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out they houndin' dawg
Singin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Singin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as 'Ol Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskAY had them girls feelin' friskAY
And even if they did wanna get bizzAY
Freaky like MissAY and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you a fuck up of free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like ChingAY
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gAY
Spanish girls tell ya "No hable ingle"
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself

You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more thatn you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business niggas don't forget it
Cuz a wiseman can shoose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - you all can get it I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like you hold a gat, right?
The trip you on must be short cuz you pack light - act right
You got it twisted tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' New ?Wopian? and followin' Malachi
Oh, anything would rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
I'ma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour
Not that I'm wylin' or even promote violence

But she believe in shoes & cars
You more like "I love to start shit"
I'm more of the, trips to florida
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the Water
Man why can't life always be this easy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopdee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas get me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But what do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it's been a while
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay
A-bay late-ly you been all on my brain
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
It'd go, get this difficult
First class with the seat back I still see ya
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights

I was breed to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon summer time no joke

I can't live my I
I can't live my life this way
Continuely get high
Instead of runnin round lock one bird down
Show no respect can't live that way
Ya hold my cheque can't live that way
Without my chick on deck can't live that way
They say what they like but I been that way
Our moves calculated through the lense
Almost here
Success will be the best revenge
And now from Clint East to Kanye West

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm deck on the grind
I know there's thing in my life
That I'ma let go startin tonight
I can't li my I, I can't li my

Look down
Go ahead flip a coin so the game can start
Believe I know the drama give name to part
I know before the hot flame came the spark
It's like before the pop fame came to pour
But this industry will play with your life man
They're playin with rent, food water and lights man
That's why I rock the beats like that old totty T Jam
The batter ram then i'm off to Amsterdam
To rest up a strength to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals to deal with this hate
I dedicate this to Jam Master J
Run DMC showed me how to walk this way

And I'm just tryin' to play it cool
Wonderin' what you gon' do now
Are you playin' around? Oh, what now?
Tell me what's that's
And that you're on your way, well, okay, okay
What I'm sayin', don't say it, don't say it
Baby, you have got to be playin'
Where are you?
Are you comin' back? Still callin' through
And she say she at the club with her girl
And it's her girl's birthday and she keepin' her there longer
And, uh, you know how that goes
And she want to see me so bad
Oh, so she's leavin' in about fifteen minutes
After this, uh, one favorite Pitbull song plays, goes off
And you know what type of textses niggas send at that time
I texted her and I said, "Are you alive?"
That's when you send that text
And you say, "Hey, are you alive?"
Cause the only reason why you not here
Bitch, you better have died
And a nigga so goddamn horny
You know what I said? "Okay"
I'm just sayin', "Okay"
Now the dick wins
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
And I can't understand, holdin' a white wine
BlackBerry in my hand
Lookin' at the time, 7 a.m
I can't believe this bitch sent me through this shit again
Oh, you got me, huh?
Are you gon' give me every chance you get?
You gon' give me every chance you get?
I don't know when you're gonna quit
This why I left your ass in the first place
This why I helped your ass in the first case
And you don't have the nerve to text a nigga
I left the door cracked open
New York City is dangerous, I could have been robbed
What you think?
I would take that chance for some pussy moanin'
This the type of pussy you risk your life for
This the type of pussy you need your wife for
This the type of pussy you spend the night over
And lookin' back, tryin' spend the night over
And I'll admit it
Even though I'm disrespected as a motherfucker
I still, still want to hit it
Got an ass like that cause I paid your ass again
My friends say, "What the fuck is wrong with them?"
Cause ain't no sex like a ex
Ain't no sex like your ex
Ain't no sex like your ex, ain't no sex like
You know, cause you'd be so mad at that motherfucker
And you know they got a new motherfucker
And you know you just want to fuck her
And prove that the next nigga ain't as good as you
And he can't do what you do
So, baby, if you give me one chance to dance
Put the devil in a purple light
If you give me one chance to dance
Alright, don't say, don't say
Where she'll stop, I'll never know, don't say
Where did all the lovers go?
Where she'll stop, I'll never know
So, hey, so, hey
Don't say you, don't say you will
Hey, don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, don't say, don't say, don't say you will, you will

I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou
You go with twenty-five hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow

H to the Izzo, did three thou spins in a week
You did a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit, but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to The killin' y'all from Chi-Town
How your wife gon' say she never sold drugs a day in her life
But she still wanna pump the yay
And y'all mad cause y'all not knowin'
Cause these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up, whether to stop or keep goin'
I got Gs, rock, rock and roll tees with no sleeves
Tats showin', tucked in, strap showin'
How he get seven TVs in that 'Lac, 'Lac?
Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back, back
While you in that hatchback and tryin' to sell work
And don't get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studio gon' give you your daps back
And try to get published
And all you get is your ass capped and that's that

I just bought my mom a new car and a house
And that's a lot to say for a college dropout
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
And brought back a couple platinum plaques on the plane
And brought back that soul shit that changed the game
They have no beat, they had to aim the stain, the steel
Got lizards in my R. Kelly strain
They real, man, I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me, "Stick to the beats"
I could've ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
I got killed these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push miracle whips
Gonna save purple haze and some syrup to sip
It have you so right, you drive on the left lane
Gettin' head, crash
Your head hit the window, now that's brain

You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I wanna fuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major

We major? Come on, homie, we major

Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line
Ask the reverend was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want like wino's want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me

Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothin' to something now pimpin' that's a savior

First line, should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-four's or black christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent
And I'm thinking it's time
Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns

Like better late than never is orientation

Can I talk my shit again? Can I talk my shit again?
I'ma be late though
I gotta figga out what I'm finna wear
The Roc is definitely in the building
Good music's definitely in the building
On the vocals, he sings quite beautiful don't you agree? Don't you agree?
And John Brion on the keys right now and Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they asked me, why you call it "Late Registration" 'ye?
Cause we taking these muh'fuckers back to school

If you're feeling good
Like better late than never it's orientation
It's orientation
We want you to get used to this

You can't do what we do, baby

And all the crazy shit I did, that'll make the best memories
Seems my old friends always make the best enemies
Can't make ends, without making bills
And you can't ask fake niggas to keep it real
Baby, I can't, I can't, I can't, argue no more
When the only thing deep about you is your throat
Why you always rock the boat?
I swear you harder to read than a doctor's note
I put my demons on the page
And put my passion on the stage
Crashing on the websites, spazzing on the websites
Driving on the wrong side, crash into the waves
Surfs up, tide's low, so you can see the stakes, drive slow
You in the presence of ghetto royalty
Do what the fuck we want and pay the lawyer fees
I'm in Paris driving in the same lane
Where Princess Diana was killed by the damn fame
The lonely king, who's only flaw is
Looking for somebody that's flawless
No fairy tale, no ending to this story book
This could very well be the same road that glory took
Or Maria Antoinette, the fall of the Rome
The ghost of the fallen king is calling me home

She rich nigga drunk
Don't let her rich nigga fuck
Said she never been a quitter but she finna give it up

She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
A broke nigga text her she roll her eyes like what this nigga want

The young crowd went wild, with Oscar-winning film director and video artist Steve McQueen twirling his scarf over his head up in the VIP box

McQueen related how the project came about

Tickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charity

Kardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration

"My mom has the one that's just as is. So I feel like mine's a little special," she said

"And now it's a really dope coat," West concurred

I am the magic man
Got the world in his hands, world in his hands
He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands

The magic man
The show goes on in 6 minutes and this is his lovely assistant
Shes so beautiful don't you agree?
He made her to the star she always wanted to be
Buhblaaoowww, are those the stars you wanted to see?
The magic man could make the roof disappear and every car in his fleet
Was on dubbz, he could take a bird flip it to 3
Release the doves, turn any bar into the fight club
Gotta fight every night to prove my love
Ya messin with this joker but you need a king
Cause he'll club anybody tryna jack his queen
Ima call a spade a spade from the start
He gave you diamonds, shoulda gave you his heart, ya see?
Jealousy strikes again, but she, said I'm just tryna wave at the man
Then he, turned her eyes black and blue with the wave of his hand
The Magic Man..

Abracadabra, from a dime piece to pieces of a dime bag lady
Each package, new baggage
Implemented a tragic plan
A volunteer from the audience, for the magic man
I have doubt my hat with natural flowers
She wanted work but wouldn't put any actual hours
Her dude had the keys to super natural powers
So she still with this new guy who can supply that white tiger like Siegfried and Roy

Indeed the boy, had that sweet street magic like David Blaine and she made it plain
If I had any advice that could save her, I could just save it man, and I can't understand that baby
She said you ain't no Houdini, ahhhh I know I ain't
I am an artist that can help you escape
Do y'all feel that, or is it cold just in here
For his next trick, TADA, he made her soul disappear

Wallah, She knew that i was into the stars
I didn't have to tip her,she was into my bars
A Tender,as slender as the pictures you remember, when you were younger
You wonder how she get from under, the sheets
She do a trick and keep it discreet
She wore a mink, fuck a rabbit just to keep the mystique
High like the magic frank had in the streets
In the sweetest way her status and her habits are meet
Its kinda tragic to see, this young woman cut in half
Thought she was the one but she couldn't do the math
In a flash, so fast i watch her ass disappear
He had game, pulled a quarter from the back of her ear, and macked in her ear
And played with her dreams, in a world where everything ain't the way that it seems
Under her spell,she let any dave cop a feel, i tried to tell the girl the magic man is not for real
The magic man..

He's got the whole world in his hands.x4
He's got Natasha in his hands, He's got Stephanie in his hands
He's got Jessica in his hands, He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got your old girl in his hands. He's got your new girl in his hands
He's got your next girl in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands

I knew she wouldn't vibrate
No I seen her inner eyes
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise
Told her I had a girl, nah I didn't lie
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibrate
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe
Boo back in 92' I was just like you
I'm like any other guy buy ice to stay cool
Like any other kid that claim they hate school

'Cause until the day a real man stands up

Out of state though, man that hurt yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo
You never listen to me then the call drop hmm
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
Trying to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week

'Cause until that real man stands up

Kanye to The, yeah, you heard the name
Cheques plus raps finna murder the game, uh
Can y'all get it? Fuck y'all
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

All these niggas believe
They breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only difference though, I fuck better hoes
Iceberg clothes, I got to pose
Every whip with the studio in a hospital
This nigga flow is very sick
Plus very rich hoes, very thick chain, very thick
Feel like I could fuck every bitch
Twenties at the bottom, carry the six
If I cop back, then shot him, I buried him six
You can't hate this nigga with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
Plus your taste is rather tasteless
Test my aim and watch me ace this
You wack rap cats need a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
Reach down to my Timbs, grab my laces
Got loops on niggas, y'all want a tight noose on niggas
What the fuck I got to do, another truth for niggas?
See, it don't really matter what y'all prove to niggas
Y'all ain't satisfied 'til we shoot some niggas
So if somebody got to die, tell me who want it
That Chi-Town, South Side bullshit, we on it

Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop, then froze

Man, bitch, I ain't finished with your ass
Heavy all night, spendin' cash at the ball
At the show and before we got back
At the gas station buyin' your ass snacks
At the liquor store buyin' act right juice
So when we get bid-ad, you know how to hit that
Next time, bring some friends for me to get at
But no fat hoes, you expect me to hit that?
Molly set me up like, "K got scratched"
Run up in the crib mad, stuck with that
Y'all niggas talk that, but y'all don't really lit that
So I had to hit them with the flat out, get your ass out
You tuned in with the boss of the bosses
NFL, no fuckin' losses
Chain flossless, fuck with it cost us
We go broke, we take y'all for hostage

Then she drop and froze

You see me rollin', smokin', coastin', boastin'
Plus a little gone off the potion
Oh, and known for flossin' a little too often
Might end up in a coffin
I'm floatin' cause I don't smoke like that
Y'all niggas want to plot, we don't joke like that
Faggot-ass niggas get approached like that
Matter of fact, murder gettin' wrote like that
I'm finna take these niggas back to the streets
Back to hoppin' out the 'Lac with the heat
Back to the fifty, posin' with some bitches
In front of that airbrushed 2Pac picture

And then she drop and froze

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
I bet they show off their token blacky
Saw him on break next to the "No Smoking" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
My life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Never wanna to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
Puttin' them pants shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
I all had that snatched from me
A and R's and their faculties all turn their back on me
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off
And take me brother for a ride

My father was a black panther
My father who ain't in heaven

My momma was raised in the era when
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
New Slaves

You see there's leaders and there's followers

They throwin' pussy at me

And your brand new car
With your brand new job
Its still a new slave
No matter who you are

Yes, welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli

Ladies...

I got you in the mood, for an interlude
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview
I know you into me, so, let me get into you
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin and rappin and *fcukin*, And passin the dutch and Relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin
The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins
Just because we stuff 'em in the oven
My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady
But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told y'all, oh
Lose, eat crews like crews like soulfood
The only producer that feel like "fuck rappers!"
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say *cracker*
Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like..
You ain't figured out what I'm about yet
Always rockin that 'this ain't out yet'
But this ain't 'bout that
From a city where niggers plug like outlets
Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so
When I go out, niggers always out to get me in the studio
And I ain't in the mood to flow
I'm with my girl and I'm tryin to hit the movies yo
And they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tooty
This girl got a silicone booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G...

Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
'Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for the people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bonjangles-ass dudes
Dancin around the club, doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!

I walked in the crib, got two kids
So I had to did, what I had to did
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Now the money coming slow, but a least a nigga know

You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it "Jump Off" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him

It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems

Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away

I break bread wit thieves and pastors, OG's and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You ain't killin it, yo that's man-slaughter
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
I stand for the blue collar, on the side making a few dollars
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like

Yeah hey yo Fab
I can tell they ain't used to this
I can tell they ain't
Wit ya boy the Louie Vuitton Don
A.K.A. Marty Mint Fly
And I'm on my fly shit
Straight from the Chi bitch
I can tell they ain't they used to this
You keep askin' questions
Dumb ass suggestions
Must ain't never lived like this
Why the funny faces
Nah the funny chase
You just ain't never drink like this
You can't even lie
You probably got high
But you ain't never smoked like this
I see shoppin' bags
Might pop some tags
But you was never fly like this
I'm a let ya wife peep game get used to this shit
Like Life meet Laine
Laine meet Life
Y'all two get acquainted
Its so cool bein' my new chick ain't it?
Let me explain it
I don't make up shit
I just Lorraine it maybe Jacob shit
Make a 36D from a A cup bitch
A set of keys to a pad and a Jag
Fendi spas Paddington bags
Cockiness to add in ya swag
Take a look at what you had and then gag
Like ill
Hell naw
Well ma
I'm here to catch you
They say men are dogs you know what I'm here to fetch you
You probally got high
Uh Roc-A-Fella
Black people usin' black cars isn't it ironic?
Smokin' weed on the yacht isn't it the chronic?
Plus the hoes good
Its feelin' like rose wood
That plus all the bullshit we on it
Cops'll pull you over like isn't there a problem?
No sir
But I realize the windows so blur
That you might've mistaked a nigga for a chauffeur
Now the dreads said to rap on everything
Cause he know that I snap on everything
Listen, when my flow commissions
It caused the commissioner to throw a cap on everything
My accountant said
If I get the crib on the side of the mountain
Right beside the fountain
And decide on the Phantom
I'd go broker than Hammer
Performin' in pajamas
Damn it
Dumbass suggestions
My flow got teeth marks in it and I know who the biters is
Can't blame them but whoever they writers is
Matter fact whoever the dick riders is
Get your own style don't Winona Ryder his
Ferrari Fab or you could say Spyder Spizz
SLR pullin' up on the side of his
Shorty's success ain't even near as hot as his
This dudes paper thinner than Easy Wadha is
I made me laugh yo
But if you do the math though
I've been gettin' money since Kojak had a afro
I've been fresh since
Will Smith was a Fresh Prince
Had hoes when Kermit was a tadpole
So of course the officers wanna off us
Came off the corner to up in the corner office
I thought it was livin'
They call it ballin'
It been like this
Where the hell all of y'all been?

This is actually an official mixtape
It's really me
And I've
I got DJ A-Trak on the cut!
It's GOOD Music!

Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
Right when I hear this music, it brings me back to a place and time
It brings back a lotta memories
So hopefully, when y'all hear this tape)
Lookin' out my window
Sun shinin' bright
I've got good music on my radio
How did your love songs play from those doors?
I don't want no one to come in to catch me sigh
But every since you left, said goodbye

I wish you were here with me

Somethin' 'bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me
I keep on looking for a, a brighter day
When all I see is time slipping away
I've got to stop and get myself together
All I can see is stormy weather

There's only one girl on my agenda
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon

And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right
They got it all
They've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't fall
To fake anymore
To live this facade and smile as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn
We pretend we're having tonnes of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone
Is she thinking of me
Did she forget what we once had
Just give me the chance to get it right get it right
Oh they got it all you can see they got it all
They got the cars the boat and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more
But I can't take another minute of y'all
He wants his kids and the dog
He wants his breakfast in bed
He's got his trust fund saved
Not a worry in his head
He's not you or me
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me
Cause I feel like taking off
Just give me a chance to get it right get it right
Yeah I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova tonight
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone

Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan

Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet?
He was as black as the street was
I never could see why people'd reach a
You see how I played the big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'd never rock a mink coat in the summertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the wintertime like will.i.am
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

People not sayin' what's not for him

Haters, start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
They forget to get they hair cut
Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks or Adidos
Can they add that he just spazzed out at that show?
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India.Arie award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please award
But I'll just take the I Got A Lot of Cheese award

Everybody talkin', but when it hit the fan

Keep the pianos goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
I got to keep it goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

When I wrote this dope shit, what I noticed was so bogus
A lot of people talk about you when you growin' up
But you got to stay focused
People who was number one in school end up like smokers
People you talk the most about
No doubt, sometimes end up the dopest
Anybody know they can't touch the way I flow
I guess it was the way I run from school to school
And sometimes wasn't treaten cool and broke all the rules
And always ended up in the office like Michael Scott
Now I got rings like Michael got
That's Jordan, let me tell you somethin' more important
You think I wrote this, no, it just comes off the top of my
Whatever topic I
Stop it, I'm probably the best out, Mr. West out
Yo, don't nobody want to bout
I knock people out in the first round. the first down
Hear the touchdown, y'all don't even want to clown
With the red shoes on just to let you know I'm freestylin'
Yes, ill, I'm wilin'
I see you, uh, at the mall to show this is my mornin' flow
So imagine my midnight sight when I ignite lyrically
I just might, everybody just bite
When I wrote this, I was picturin' a little girl in high school
With people pickin' on her, tellin' her what she not
Then she'd grow up to be model, so they'll be hot
And everything she not made her slam it
Everything she not made it everything she am
That's incorrect English, but I'm way too distinguished
Can understand this, I rock the planets
Cameras be candid, on, I was lookin' at my prior image
My wire image, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin', get it?

Damn, damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan

And I'm a keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And you just keep goin', goin', goin'

Now when they get hard, I need you to keep goin', goin', goin'
And one day you gon' show them, show them, show them

Jamie Foxx
Yeah she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger, way over town
That digs on me

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas

Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

'Cause when she leave your ass she gon' leave with half
And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his

And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl

Let me hear that back....

I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
So ya never know, never, never know
Never know enough, til it's over, love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin no, no, no, no, no

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keeping ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line

Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I met no one new, I got no one new
But I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
I been down this road, too many times before

Now keep ya love locked down, you lose, you lose, you lose

Hello Ladies and Gentlemen
It's Friday morning
May 25th
2007
You know I never say the dates but since this is a mixtape

I'ma stop playing with they emotions
Let's go

Ooh I promise not to do it again
I promise not to do it
You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
'Cause you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do
Like erase my phone
And keep it out of town
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around
Well I should have known one say you'd find out
But you can't go and leave me now
You know that I love you
There's no one above you
I said it the last time
But this is the last time
Don't make me over
'Cause I can be faithful
Baby you're my number one
You're my number one
Now who is she?
What's her name?
You don't need to know about everything
We fight about this
We fight about that
You hang up the phone and call me right back
Well I'll never be something I'm not
Please don't throw away what we've got
'Cause we've been together for way too long
I was playing around but I'm coming home
I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
They say they shop on eBay - baby why is they frontin'?
They be on the internet but they never cop nothin'
I keep you in Girl what is those on your toes?
And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis
He got a mind of his own and he just be seeing shit
And I don't want to cheat but I don't be saying shit
I try to jack off he ask me who is you playin' wit?
But I know he love you he told me you was his favorite
You're making it hard for me
You're messing up everything
You tell me I gotta leave
Say we over
You saw that she came over
Came in the Range Rover
Left with a hangover
I promise I won't cheat
I promise I won't lie
I promise I'll act right
You can't tell me
I can't have you
I can't have that
We ain't over
Hey, it ain't over baby
Oh you don't need to go it's not over
Oh it's gonna be alright now don't go now

Some people
Some people really are
And the night falls)
As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out
Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make ya scream out

Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true)
They are still dreaming
Some people really

How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich?
Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick
So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright
Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up wit' green
I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen
Wit' little niggas wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye
We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together
Now you gets deaded on

She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle
Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure
Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who
Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools
And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it
Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards
Still dreamin'

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......
Vegas on acid
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "pssh we messed up"
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

From what I hear Kanye is killing that game very bad
My girl rockin' the little lamb that Mary had
Little bit of ghosta style mixed with Mosta style
I'm versatile, I'm the poster child
Gettin' cheese so I'm supposed to smile
Get it?
We making hits like Sosa now
Hit it!
And I, hate when girls actin' boushie as hell
And I already seen 'em naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gonna make my kids stupid as well?
Our Father, please for give me
I am sinner, slash winner, slash soul inventor

And when you hear, swear it feel like soul food man

Look, my mommy don't be playin' cause she know I got my game intact
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
And chickens know I'm gonna do it like I wanna do it
And miscommunication, no we never run into it
I got chicks like Samone and Colla
Stay with lip gloss and Fendi bag beside her
And your girl said she ain't ready for me
I'm in love so mommy got me singin' Teena Marie
High above the Giovanni, she ain't Gucci or Prada
Climbin' in the Mirada, studin' like a scholar
So I don't even bother
I be poppin' my collar
I can get into your soul when I call you tomorrow

I know you gotta lot of stress today
Let's hit the party like we just got paid
Now if you really want to get away
Say yeah, yeah
Got people on your back constantly
And you never get a second for free
You know you gotta get away with me
So say yeah, yeah

Yo, I'ma worry bout the trades and ballin'
I'm gonna trade it all
I'd rather catch up on my paper and evade them all
You sore losers picked the wrong guy to take a fall
I probably train and fall
For what they made in the fall
Made it to a never-quite-was to an overnight buzz
Cause the way I flip a metaphor, nobody quite does
By the time I leave the club
I'm weighing the pros and cons
Cause she must have been a pro the way she approach the Cons
And Con man is an army
Money boss on
We so big be hoppin' out when I'm tryin' to do my laundry
But I ain't even sorry for the way I get my doe
Cause J, Kanye and Con got that food for your soul, go!

Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

N-n-now that that don't kill me
?Cause I can't wait much longer

?Cause I can?t get much wronger
Man I?ve been waitin' all night now
That's how long I?ve been on ya

More than ever ever after
Our work is

Let?s get lost tonight
Play secretary I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a f*** what they all say, right?

Damn they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask ?cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real **** anymore?

?Cause right now thou has forsaken us
That I would even show up to this fake sh**

So go ahead go nuts, go ape sh**
Specially in my Pastel and my Bape sh**
Act like you can't tell who made this new gospel
Homey take six and take this, haters

I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot

I'm trippin' I'm caught up in the moment, right?

'Cause this is Louis Vuitton dime night
Well I?d do anything for a blonde ****

You know how long I?ve been on ya?
Since OJ had isotoners

Uh, baby you're making it

Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
And this rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang

They throwing hate at me
I'm going Bobby Boucher
Y'all throwing contracts at me
Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
See that's that privately owned prisons

Now what if Michael Jordan decided to stick to baseball and Jay-Z decided to stick to crack
Just Blaze decided to stick to engineering and Kanye never decided to rap?
What if a nigga from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word
'Cept the nigga's really putting it down
Some things they gone never change
The kings got rid of us, they selling a crackhead soap
Now follow me, sometimes I feel like dream is subtitles
Say things that mean things but hide them in club titles
So you'll hear something real but think that it's meaningless
Like, "Damn, I know I feel but I don't know what the meaning is!"
See that there's what make it so ingenious
And that's why Kweli never was lenient
Cause he know what I got, know I was making it hot
'Fore I was making a lot, 'fore I made it to the Roc

This performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song

Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.

Shia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.

If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's

Louis that, Goucci this, just got a model chick
Something feel different...
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship

Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that He-Su's?"
But I bet she never had them D's...

But I'ma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan
She say f**k getting them D's
I'ma just ride out with these

They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie...
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
They don't knowwwww

They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Kara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga wit dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breath it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin "Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!"
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon check myself in - again

They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen "The Corner", now they say "That nigga's back," uh...

Throw your hands up high
'Til they reach the sky

Lo- Lord, the air is foul with the smell of hypocrisy
As bloody armies scream- screams for victory
Lying there in the mire is a mama and child
Their anguished cries trampled by boots on either side

Now with bloodshot eyes we look out beyond earth's gate
Seeking new planets to plant seeds of hate, yeah
Progress, it's said, makes for a softer bed, mmm
But no one will lie easy if everyone lies dead
Now it's time, I think, and I think you'll agree, oh
To love thy neighbor and set all men free
So take the shackles from the wings of the dying dove
And permit her to fly away to peace and love, yeah

'Cuz five years ago, you was so Fugees

Yeah, Yeah

I used to front when I write songs
Talkin' about having ice on
And I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick I should've got a medic
When the dropout dropped I had to cop me a money tree
With so much personality what do u want from me
My life this year my career is the lore
Bad shit is a war is for Melissa ford
'94 I could only afford this accord
From the home of gang bangin and we all outdoors
Southside outside westside lets ride eastside right beside lakeshore drive

Where you at the whole city behind us
Southside outside westside lets ride

It ain't nothing to it but to do it
I came here to shut the place down
Till my body starts pumpin red fluid
A-town I been through it
And we steady getting tested
But ready to feel your bubble
When we put the lead to it
Out west they still bangin
Up top it's really gulley
Down south we get buck and turn hearts to silly putty
Ludacris I got silly money you got jokes
I'll be laughing all the way to the bank now that's really funny
Big city bright lights, and many pity cause we like fights
Maybe long days but its fight nights
Living out the night life
And people asking where u at
Not the club ill stay in to get ripe
Hot-lanta home of the booty's and the really tight skirts
Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt
From Decatur down to C.P., and E.P.,
Adam's field to the battlefield, Its D.T.P

Its Compton's prodigy obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steering columns of Impalas
And to get hollow we fightin' pit bulls and rot weiler's in the projects
The objective is make dolla's
Where you at?
It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
Cause I got a female friend with frequent flier mileage
I ain't ever been to college got the IQ of a road scholar
If you follow G Unit throw up your dub's and yell hollar
To all the Y G's in khaki's and white tee's
With Air One's in every color like Ice T
The way I paint pictures with these hip hop scriptures
Pay attention why the Game shine like a prism
Glisten show you how canaries could alter ones vision
Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened
On behalf of Luda and Kanyeezy
I'm gone breath easy

Now, blaze that!

Hell yeah!, hey dj bring that back!
How you ain't gone fuck?, bitch I'm me
I'm the god damn reason you in V. I. P
Ceo, you don't have to see id
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
Blaow, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?!, the club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this

Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gone rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over your chest
Ahh!, come on we gone party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight!

Stand up! Stand up!
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, "get down!"
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack "The Tripper"
My nigga Tony been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real rolex it don't even be ticking
Without 'em clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks Red Hot like Anthony Kiedis
To see this Jesus the sweetest of detest
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Hovah get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was rehired
It ain't a song, it's a video called Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins

We should've never ever let Michael Jordan play for the Wizards
We should've never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
Why did that happen?
We couldn't stop-we would stop-MJ playing for the Wizards
Six championships
The best years of our life
Playing through the flu
Every single night
I believed I could fly
And I wanted to be just like Mike
Does anybody here know why that happened?
When a player
When a player wants to become an owner
When a player that's done more for the league than the league could've done for him
When a player that made the NBA wants to become an owner of the team that he brought so much glory to, a team he brought so much story to
A team that has his statue in the front of the motherfucking building
But do you know what the owners of that team told MJ?
You're just a player, homeboy
You can't get no pay
You can't own shit
They told Michael Jordan he couldn't own shit!
Now y'all know why MJ went to play for the Wizards
Because this very team wouldn't let him be an owner
I'm talking about one of the most important people in our civilization
One of the most influential people in our civilization
They tried to marginalize
And in order to make his point he had to put on a motherfucking Wizards jersey
To let y'all know "Oh yes I am gonna be an owner just like Magic Johnson"
We should've never let MJ ever play for the Wizards
Never never never never let him go
Because til I die MJ represents the Bulls
So tonight I'm about to put my 23 on
So tonight I gotta put my 23 on

I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven
Oh,oh,oh,oh
Man It's so hard not to act reckless
To who much is given much is tested
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V, my mama couldn't get through to me
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me
I ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to the Hill man

La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
La, la, la, la then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

This is my life homey, you decide yours
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that muthafucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homey this is my day
You know I already graduated

They're so sensative
To say something when you gon' end up apologin'
Let me know if it's a problem man
Alright man, holla then

You don't need a stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos?
Treasure. What's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada
Adam Eve wear Nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
Ya homies looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my god

Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Mmm hmm, that's that shit

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say "When you see clothes close your eyelids"
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey! hey! hey! hey!

I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we lived
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious

When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E
Now they know they invincible hey! hey! hey!

Runners on your mark and they pop the guns!
Stand up, stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?

Runners on your mark and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes

Just a little somethin' show you how we live

Now throw your hands up in the sky

I'ma get on this TV, mama
I'ma, I'ma put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

Where niggas that sell D
The good life, let's go on a livin' spree

It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh

And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry

Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lowry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

I'ma get on this TV mama

'Cause they got more ass than the models
The good life, so keep it comin' with them bottles
Till she feel boozed like she bombed at Apollo

It feel like VA or the Bay or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life

Homie, tell me what's good
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thin' I wish?
I wish a nigga would

He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should

Hey, I'ma get on this TV mama

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said, "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Havin' money's the everythin' that havin' it is

I was splurgin' on trizz, but when I get my car back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas 'cause
I always had a passion for flashin' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy?
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl callin' me baby

And if you feelin' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey
Ooh, I'm good

'Cause it don't look like a thug or a hood

'Cause that shit'll have me zonin for a couple of weeks

'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough
Then fake a pregnancy, then call the attorney-a

'Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice

Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands in the air
I'm sending a message in a bottle
It says "We need a new tomorrow"
And we need some new leaders to follow
Yeah we need some new leaders to follow
I'm telling you everything that I know
And I'mma tell you this because I should
Sting, you the only police good in the hood
Air, air, now throw your hands in the air, air
And we gonna elect John the mayor
Air, wave 'em around like you just don't care, yeah
Wave 'em around like you just don't care, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We can save the world!

I'm known for running my mouth
I will not be accountable for what comes out, uh
I dunno, I might have said it
I was kinda gone and light-headed
And my jacket kinda fresh bright reded
And as usual my pants tight-threaded
It seem like everybody dress tight now
And I just want my credit
Don't get it twisted it or dreaded it
I am the king and will not beheaded
To the mall no time soon, brethren
Being broke made my head hurt
So I need the bread or an Excedrin
That'll only get my engine revvin'
While y'all on ten, I'm on eleven
I'm a make the news, be on at seven
Matter fact I'm on this very second
I'm in first and y'all in second
And this verse only add to the freshness
Call the club, tell them add to the guest list
What you think? Way more bitches?
I can never be too big for my britches
Y'all motherfuckas know who this is
I'm gifted
Merry Christmas
I'm armed with pens, and I got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time
You don't know my mind
Like I said a thousand times
I gotta stay ahead
Know what I'm fighting for
I leave you to your talk
Never seen my kind before
And you're all so thick-headed
Follow and I know I let it
Part of me won't let me quit
Won't let me just not say shit
So much is there to be bored with
Can't be still, I can't afford it
Try to hold it in but it make me sick
So I spit it out say the hell with it
I dream it and I build it tall
Make a way for when it falls
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the

And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said "You lying yo, why is you lying Joe?
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys."
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treating fat girls differently
She said you need a little ice just to keep me cool
No dimes but baby here go the family jewels
I'm tight with my doe like my family Jews
Uh! I said "Jews" my career is screwed
I ain't mean in the Hanukkah sense of the word
I realize it's a sensitive word
Plus a lot of best friends is white
I mean ah, I mean my Air 1's, my diamonds and my Benz is white
And I ain't one of them producers that pretend to write
Ayo, Teefa, uh why don't you come on grab the mic

Yo yo
I know you use to being a womanizer
Coming at me and girls talking 'bout a men-a-
You're some fool
Thinking I'm gon' strip like Moulin Rouge
While you biting off my garter
I'm not easy you gotta come harder
I want a man, not just a baby father
Haha
Why you kick it with your guys fo'?
You got eyes for girls, just spread it out
You done pissed Teefa off like draining my bladder out

Ayo my Rocafella chain hurt the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A little bit of Ghost's style mixed with Mos's style
I'm versatile I'm the poster child
Getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile, get it
We making hits like Sosa now, hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell

Aw, forget it, forget it

Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!

How you ain't gone FUCK?, bitch I'm me
I'm the GOD DAMN reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace
And I'm looking for a THICK, young lady to pull

But where the FUCK is the waitress at with my drinks?!

Stand up! stand up!

We FIRE, y'all RETIRE

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

What'd you hear this time
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lyin'
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And the whole hood's buzzin'
Then he said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Somethin' that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, hey, hey
They ain't gon' stop
They just want what we got

The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about
And then they just runnin' they mouths
All we do is tune them out

I swear they got some nerve
Spreading what they heard
I can't give them no words
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved, that's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon' show and prove

Kanye....

Here's a couple of things I can't honor, man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann
I'm wonderin' why she "ret to go" like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I'll trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember when I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around and giggle said; "You so nuts!"
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get the new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

Go on...ohh...
How can they talk about our love?

I don't wanna hear it no more...

You wanna rock with me
Come and let me
Give you what you need
Girl don't play
Send him on his way
Come ride with me

And the party was just so tense is
But all this waiting around is just so senseless
And I've been calling her phone so relentless
Mama said the phone bill was so expensive
Your eyes slanted like Lucy Liu
You're frank couture to the juicy suit
Your lips sweater than a Juicy Fruit
From your Louie Vuitton bag to your Gucci boots
Whether we on a train or a two seat Coupe
I'mma fiend for you like Pookie do
She was there with her man, some goofy dude
And I ain't really trying to be rude to dude
All I need is a change to advance, take my hand
Understand from a dance I could end up your man
If I'd been scared wouldn't have seen her again

"Get Right for the Summer" workout tape
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit-ups right and
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Tell me who's invited, you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me, Henny make girls look like Halle Berry to me
Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came
I came, I came
It's been a week without me and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she talk about freakin' out, then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out now
Ooh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said get it wet
Ooh, girl your breath is harsh, cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yeah I bought them cars still kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweatin' to the oldies, we jukin' to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone so you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, though you ain't fit girl I'll still hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends, okay 3 more, now hop in the Benz
4 door, do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
Hi, my name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to Kanye's workout plan
I was able to pull a NBA player
And like, now I shop every day on Rodeo Drive
I just want to say thank you Kanye, woo, woo, woo!
My name is Lasandra and I just want to say
That since listenin' to Kanye's workout tape
I was able to get my phone bill paid
I got sounds and 13's put on my Cavalier
And I was able to get a free trip to Cancun
And what's most importantly
Is that I ain't gotta fuck with Ray Ray's broke ass no mo'
Work it mo', juke it mo'
Pump it mo, Chi-town mo'
Let's go mo'
My name is Alamae from Mobile, Alabama
I been able to date outside the family
I got a double wide and I rode a plane, rode a plane, rode a plane
Rode a plane, rode a plane

Lemme break ya off a piece of my favorite workout plan
I wanna see you work out, ooh
That's right, put in work, move your ass, go berserk
Eat your salad, no dessert, get that man you deserve
I said it's Kanye's workout plan
Ladies and gentlemen
Allow myself to introduce myself
This time around I want y'all to clap with me, like this
His workout plan
Okay, okay, okay, that's very good
I appreciate ya time
Whoa, yeah

Number one, so together I'm eleven
She's a ten, I'm number one, together we eleven
Her friend only a seven, sent her to 7-Eleven
She a ten, she a seven, that make 'em seventeen
Let me see your ID, only seventeen?
Eesh, that could have fucked up everythin'
Nike, already don't like me, always on a white tee
Dressed like I'm hypebeast, signed through my white tee
Dont race against the American dream
Together we like the Kenyan marathon team
Three black rap acts that spit that crack
Never pushed that 'Lac, rather push somethin' German
Lookin' for a Swedish bitch that I could put my sperm in
Preach, my brother, gon' start the sermon
All I see is green, call me Erick Sermon
All I spit is thermal, long-sleeved flannel
When I touch the verse, don't touch the channel
Bought the rat a purse, she keep callin' it Chanel
Never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit annual
Now that's some dumb shit
I never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit, dumb bitch
And I mean that in a nicer sense to the word
Just act like I'm some type of nice sensitive nerd
I don't fiend female dogs
Cause I done dogged all females
Except for the ones that's only in it for the retail
She see what you got, she see what we sell
Get married so much, I swear them girls on resell
She watchin' the draft, she got your jersey already
She 'bout to pick out her crib in Jersey already
She 'bout to be pregnant by Thursday already
Congratulations, baby boy, on your new baby boy

Have you ever wondered where'd it all really went?
Wondered if you'd ever, ever find your dreams?
Wondered if life had never been that it seems?
Wondered if life is all about the high beams?
The flashin' light, tryin' to get your money right
And you be up all night, tryin' to stay fresh today
Fresh like Mr. West and I'm proudly the best
I been sold on to that guest
Uh, the number one on the charts
Why is that? Because I rap from the heart
What I always did from the start
How I always played my part
Uh, they thought I was so crazy, I got a deal with Jay Z
Now they got to pay me and they looked up lately
I sold a million the first week
'Member when I just sold my first beat
Shit can change and it never stayed the same
Ma, I wonder, I wonder what it would be now
What it would be now, you all standin' in the crowd
Ten thousand, now they hate everythin' now
Everythin' now
Or every single I dropped now, I dropped now
Tryin' do everythin' to keep shit hot now
And the media, they diss me, diss me
They say I'm so fuckin' evil
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, what the fuck do he know?
Cause I'm gonna say my, my shit
And I'm gonna talk my, my shit
And they can suck my, my, my, my
I wonder why they talk so bad
Have they ever had a artist that's so mad?
And they will never realize what they have
Somebody real in the industry
If nobody's real, then I guess it's me
And they, "Freedom," and it's not free
Cause every time I talk freely they attack me
They give me backlash, backlash, backlash
Black, but they can kiss my ass, my ass, my ass, my ass
I say, "Why ask? Why ask? Why?"
Try but try, can they's fly?
Now touch the sky, touch the sky, touch the sky
And I wonder, baby, to can know what it means
What we know
And I wonder, baby, if you know what it means

Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna bee

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right

She said she wants some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right

I told her to drive over in her new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip
Then I want you to strip

Then you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin'
Callin' me Biggie like Shyne home

Man I swear she fine, homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds
When she know they rhinestones

I played Ready For the World, she was ready for some action
My dawg said, "You ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong."

I'mma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get it right

She said she wants some Ready For the World, some New Edition

Got you lookin' at the gliss, at my hands and wrists
While I'm likely at smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' original like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain' no messin' with Kan-man and Twist

From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy
Twistin A-marie
Try'na Smoke a B
Lookin' properly
Feelin' on a G

Come with me and sip on some regular champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving, so I'm bumpin' a little Spinners

While I'm smokin' On a B
Dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got to leave
On the 23's

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let my get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze For Maze
Fulfilling our every sensation, slow jammin', having deep sex

You Ready For the World girl
Come on over, make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controllin' me, I'm lovin' the way you be
Holding me when I been listening to Jodeci

And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

I still spit it like it's R&B, o to the club with me
And with some Luther Come On and Hope
You finna and stilla be in love with me

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on

Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone
Just to get you goin'
Try'na make you moan

Drive slow homey... drive slow homey...
You never know homey might meet some hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

My homie Marty used to stay, Sunny 9th and May
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked the leases, he had dreams of Caprices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin'
Hit Lakeshore girls, go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout 80
See back back then then if you had a car
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lakers and our Royals, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but Dawg
Fuck all that flirtin' I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homey
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homey

Drive slow homey...
You never know homey, about these hoes homey

Paul Wall
What it do; I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'llac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
You see them fo's crawlin, you see them screens fallin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
Ridin' somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them 4's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do

If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go

Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know...

You never know homey, might meet some hoes homey
I got mo' TV's in here than where I live

And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims
I got the baller genetics baby this evidence
You see a player flickin' and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, "Just a Little' Bit"
Just a lil' bit
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
When you see them hoes, lil' homey drive slow

Drive slow homey

Yo G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, ha?

I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff in my heart right now man
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-town what's going on?

I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dessert
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry Mr. H said the izzles back to wizzerk
On the plane scared as hell, that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal, she been tryin' to be mine
She a delta so she been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use me trying to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I use two lifelines
I swear this right here is history in the makin' man
I really apologize how I sound right now man
They got my mouth wired shut for like
I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstruct
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half my jaw was missing
In the back of my mouth, man I couldn't believe it
I'm still here for y'all right now man
This is what I gotta say, right here dog
Yeah, turn me up yeah
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
But he wasn't talking 'bout Coke and birds
It was more like spoken word except he's really puttin' it down
And he explained the story about how Blacks came from glory
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
I swear to God drive a two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe, safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised, there's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up, like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta Angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought they called me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us, where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid sh** that I did

When the doctor told me I had a um
I was goin' to have a plate in my chin
I said, dawg don't you realize
I'll never make it on the plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
She can't be serious man
Right down through the wire
Even through the fire)
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit)

Don't be so

Baby don't worry bout it
Hey there don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things
The wrong things

Tell me right now you really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good, might do us good fore we be done for good
Coz I can make it good I can make it hood I can make you come I can make you go
I can make it high I can make it fly make you touch the sky hey maybe so
All the time you be up in my checking through my cellphone baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night? Here's another fight
Oh here we go

All of the time you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah you see em look baby let em look give you cold looks cuz we look cold
Yeah you heard about all the word of mouth don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed

Baby don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong thing

I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
You make them sunny and new

I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
I'm just gonna say good night

Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them
Into real life, if you try to
So close, but so far
And so far, no cigar
We can't dwell on the day PAST all we got is today

So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow
No goodbye

Uhh, to you
If I part my art will live through you
Wake up like everyday new to you

Man, you know I love you right?
You just got to be real with me
Is you cheating on me?
Nigga, there you go with that shit again
Baby, you know how I feel about you
I'm trying to make this work
My guys keeping coming to me
Telling me they seeing you and stuff
How this making me look?
Buying you them rings
Them leathers; getting your hair done every week
Gotta let me know somethin'
Look, if you don't trust me
Why the fuck is you with me?
Coming at me on some Jay-Z shit
Who you with?
Calling my cell, leaving crazy voicemails
Figured you can get me if you called my girl, Nikki
But she was with me, and I was home at seven fifty
But that was when he got technical with it
Talkin 'bout he called my house at seven fifty-nine
I don't keep up with the time
What the fuck?
You think I'm lyin'?
It all comes down to you trust me or you won't
The bottom line is you love me or you don't
And do you need me baby?
Yeah, you know I do
So you believe me, baby?
Yeah, for sure I do
Then he gave me a hug, jumped in the trunk, and went to work
He managed to leave without getting his feelings hurt
So I sat back, flamed up the weed, and thought up
Who the hell done run their mouth and almost got me caught up?
I be hatin' when you actin' brand new to me
Look, you can't be tellin' people that you doin' me
You gotta keep this, here, between you and me
Look, I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around, you don't speak to me
When my girl be around, I see you peepin' me
When they both ain't around, you be freakin' me
We used to do it secretly
Now you all talk
You tellin' everybody like you want to get caught
I think my girl catchin' on
'Cause my story keep changin' up
You gotta stop callin' up my crib and hangin' up
Truthfully, if you tellin' people that you doin' me
Then you tellin' me that you don't even want to screw with me
And that's a shame
I can't even do my thang
You get dick, and you go temporarily insane
You think it's a game, but I don't want to play no more
You want to stay, but you can't stay no more
You want to be with K, but that ain't okay no more
You got somethin' to say, but you ain't gotta say no more
I'm a tell your ass now, baby, truthfully
I ain't told nobody that you doin' me
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check, they ain't never where they're supposed to be
I learned my lesson; now I only fuck hoes that's close to me
Don't get me wrong; you still gotta live close to me
This ain't a song I made for ugly hoes to start approachin' me
You know how this go; I diss hoes
I'm very mean now
My roley face green now
I bring your self esteem down
I knew since the day I met you if I would fuck you or not
So later on I asked my girl how many bitches you got
I never loved you a lot, but then this nigga got turned out
He told his boy that told his boy, and now the word's out
My man approachin' me with rumors that he heard about
But dude a lame
He probably asked you can he work it out?
I swear, y'all, betta keep the game on 'em
Yeah, y'all, now watch me change on 'em
And always smile back if he tell you he in love
Take my advice, 'cause it's so true what women go through
He still get invitations from the last girl he been with
Bet his ho be mad; I bet she tell you that he hit it
Just check inside his pocket; find another bitches digits
I swear to God, baby, it should be you and me
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
These girls out here be thinkin' they caught up and shit
Fuck that; spend that nigga, yo; you know what I'm sayin'
You catch yourself up; you go to him
Let that nigga come to you with no type of evidence
You ain't got shit on you
I'm a do my thing
Word up, uh
Pimp on, baby

But he wasn't talkin' bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word...
- Through The Wire, The College Dropout

- We Major, Late Registration

Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me, if it isn't you
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school
- Champion, Graduation

They like, 'Oh God, why he go so hard?
Look what's he's been through he deserves an applause
- Amazing, 808s & Heartbreak

And now America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
-Who Will Survive in America, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy

What you want a Bentley, fur coat, a diamond chain?
All you Blacks want all the same things!
- New Slaves, Yeezus

Why, oh why you'd do me wrong
-Ultralight Beam, The Life of Pablo

For a chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man

I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
When you telling her your son's on life support
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a Delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
I swear this right here is history in the making man

For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all

This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo

What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash

Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man

Jamie Fox, featuring Kanye West

Last night me and my dogs was hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today, so it's all right
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
Then every record became our favorite song
And that is all that I remember

Cuz I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

When I woke up from last night's "salvatry"
Baby doll was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where
I got dress and got up out of there
But not before I call for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Every thing that I remember

Extravaganza, Extravaganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes, it was
The things that I remember
Being at the bar
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo'
Knowing that I can't afford to get mo'
Here's a broke n**** trick
Buy one bottle and sip slow
Or, or leave the club now
Do like I did
Come back when you get dough
A fish stick n****
Now we messing with lobsters
We messing with Grammies
We messing with Oscars
You messing with that dranky drank
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank
In the morning, you g'on draw a blank
The hotel said that y'all was on one
My girl wasn't on shit
I picked the wrong one
Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls
Well tonite, I'm trying to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Neva meet 'cha mother girl
You know they love it, when you love them
And they tell they friends, girrrllllll

Kanye West - "You know, they're going to blame it on the drink"
"You know, that's just an excuse to do exactly what you want to do."
"J. Fox, Kanye to the"
"And the winners are"
"That's BSP, baby"
"There's a lot of Black Star Power in the room right now"
"Easy" "Easy" "Be very easy"
"Calm down, please"

We in the streets player, get your mail
It's only 2 places you'll end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go

Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go...

Screamin' Jesus save me

Ay nigga, don't throw no shit when I'm talkin'!
JAY Z call me, Ay bruh, I know you got killers, don't send 'em at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man.

The problem is it ain't that I'm very good
It's that I'm scary good
Beats very hood, doin' numbers Mariah Carey would
Or in Hollywood doin' movies Jim Carrey would
Pardon, he's narcissist, we spittin' shit so arsonist
When I know the globe already warm before I spit
Woah, woah, woah, yeah, homie, that's the theme song
And I was high as the Learjet, fly as the insect
Even though we in debt
And it don't matter what the night, I get her number
Cause when I get my number right, she gon' come runnin'
And I be good like God with an extra O
God knows that my cheque needs some extra Os
And you know that you need to need to bring some extra hoes

Have you screamin' like 6 in the mornin'
Legs in the air I'm on them hips in the mornin'
Still feel it in your ribs while your walkin'
Sip some cognac ? contact
And I'll put you on a one year contract
I'm saying to you
Please believe baby Joe that Royce
Now the game, I took the throwback off
He playing witchu

Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel?
That wanna make a girl feel
Make her feel good?
All I wanna know
I just wanna know
Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong
When it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed?
Can't a girl from tha hood find a homie
That ain't just tryna hang around me?
Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me
Every time he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to set a full cat black case?
Stroke cause he go
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie
That wanna do more than spend money on me?

How come I got a nigga but can't trust him?
Why every answer to my question is a question?
Why can't my nigga be my own lil' somethin'?
And every girl on my block can't say they don' bumped wit?
I'm so tired of these so called wanna be hard cold pretenders that
That I ain't gotta tell how to put it on me?

Why why is it so hard
Hard for a girl like me to find a boy
Why is it so hard
You wanna deal wit' an O-G that's truly respected
Touch you in every spot that them dudes neglected
A dude that won't flirt, a dude put her to work
And you're the only one that I really wanna chill wit'
I know how you dude to make you feel missed
I take the front of ma, show you the realness
All nigga really needs is a lil' bit
From a hood chick lookin' straight off the runway
Won't bite her tongue, shorty'll say what she wan' say
From Sunday to Monday
She gon' ride whether it's in back of the Phantom or in back of the Hyundai
Not the fake baler throwin' cream in your face
Or dude that won't fall til he cream in your
Or dude to see you walkin' in them jeans and wanna taste

"I got fury in my soul
Fury's gonna take me to the glory goal
In my mind I can't study war no more."

Oh I can't study war
I can't study war
Now where the south side
Uh uh uh
Now where the west side

Even if I don't hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat, Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatello Vasaci
That's Louis Vuitton bitch
I think hennassy, I drank I'm gone on that Bacardi Lemon, I'm zoning
Class back in session so I up't it a grade
Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwyane Wade
And A
Please don't start me
I'm pop the barkers, I'm hood like parkers
While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up
Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
You all braides names catch the garter
On nights when romance
That I gotta do that yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common my man
The hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy and o yeah yeezy

No no I can't study war

How I suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammies I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little gweedo
But with my ego, I can stand there with a speedo
And still be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic
Empty bottles of no do's
Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's
The furrest man that shit that you don't floss
Why I gotta ask what that to door cost
And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinny ones
When you meet me in person what does it feel like
O hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone big pun big l or notorious
Fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna start killin' these niggas as soon as the chorus hit

Yeah I'm gonna start killin' these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Uh ha

10 10s I got for 10 million
Kanye West and K is for killin
Shout out Wayne for that reference
Big Ass Kim K is my preference
Fuck y'all don't doubt me
I listen when you bout me
So zip your lips and throw away
The goddamn muthafuckin house key

Gave Amber a rose

Than all 16 of your best bros
I kick it Sen Sai
Then Fuck Kim K
In the back of the Benz mate
Hehe yeah nigga them rims shake

I gota love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with

Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is, so basically the Chi, M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now, it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college, the other never went
We take turns doing our one, two's and yes yes yalls
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast yall
Mr. West what do you think is the best?
When it coming to spittin G, I'm one of the best yall
She look goods, smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw, that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me, no!

I got a.. way with words, I use words in ways
I convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci parka, ma what did you say?
But anyway though, she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low, got play-doh, stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card, spendin cash on Rodeo
And me, I'm at the Slausson Swap Meet
Lookin for a pair of air 1 and white tee
She want champagne, I got Sisco and Kool-Aid
Why go to the movies, let's watch the bootleg

Girl I don't wear Prada, never met Gucci
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V, I'd think that its on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
Actually, you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign, you don't want the matching hat
Huh, I'm too gutter, you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other cause plans change

And would I do em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
It's like old folks pissin cuz it all depends

Sissy niggas call em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse em
By em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose em
Take em back to confuse em
And I been known to have a hoe or two
I tell em step into the vocal booth

I kick that habit, I just, keep em impressed
Let em seat in the Lex, never, eat em unless

Do you even remember what the issue is
And that's what the intuition is
You ever wonder what it all really mean

Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
What you about
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams

I'm tryin to catch the beat, uh
I'm tryin to catch the beat
I'm tryin to catch the beat, uh uh, uh

KEEP EM HIGH
And if ya losin yo high than smoke again

Is in the pocket like Wallace, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alchoooool-ics
My freshman year I was goin through hell, a problem
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta collllllll-ege
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna folllllllllll-ow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this
Bastard's flow will bash a skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you askin fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we ask hoes
That's why we hear your music in fast fo'
Cuz we don't wanna here that weak shit no mo'

You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubblee
At NYU but she headed from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chillin on
Campus
Sent me a picture with a feelin on Candice
W-H-I-T, it's gettin late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli
I mean
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high

I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes but
GET EM HIGH, I need some tracks you tryin to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fittin' to blow you tryin' to blow back south
Well ok, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo
I though you meet that chick at that conference with yo moms
And she's the bomb, boy she got the bouji behavior
Birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much, you tryin' to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate

Get em high like noon, or the moon or a room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still fill the notes
With real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remonte, control rap is not a
Used soup it still got life, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger, Woods in the hood, should have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole on liver, niggas than you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is to sexy to even make songs like these
To many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin your
The years clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Read the infa, red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
Spittin through wires and fires, emcees retirin
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

In the night, I hear 'em talk
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
Oh... how could you be so heartless?

Just remember that you talkin' to me, yo
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into

Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold

I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up
You wait a couple months then you gon' see

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
They don't know 'bout me and you
And you just gon' keep hatin' me

I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night...

...I hear 'em talk

One and two and three and four and get them sit-ups right
And tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and, ooh, she so excited
"Tell me who's invited"
"You, your friends and my dick"
So, excuse me, miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came, I came, I came

She want to talk it out
But ain't nothin' to talk about
'Less she's talkin' about freakin' out

Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me want to light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said, "Get it wet"
Ooh, girl your breath is harsh
Off them tracks, yeah, I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on sixteen bars
Yeah, but I still mess with a big girl
Duh, you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit girl
One and you brought two friends
Okay, three more, now hop in the Benz four-door
Do you know the difference between the five, six, seven, eight
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back datin'
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballers

Stop, it's the remix

You ain't know, you better ask somebody
What we gonna do is twerk that body
All day at the fitness party
Gentlemens in the gentlemen's club
And hittin' them with an interestin' dub
It's upside down, that's for the A-Town
What y'all sayin'? F. J. Bentley caught misbehavin'
Yes, I'm the captain and I'm savin' all my money
Yes, I'm just gonna stand and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact, just pass the Courvoisier
But I will walk you to your car, my dear, cheers

Now throw your hands up

Ayy, ayy

I always had a passion for flashin'

Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!
