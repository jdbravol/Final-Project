I shoot a hundred round clip like Wilt Chamberlain
Go to the top and I'm gon' bring the gang in
Bitch, do anything to get famous
My wrist cost me a brick and it's frigid
I'm rich, but I did not let it change me
Statistics say that you niggas ain't gangsta

You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble




But I love to give a nigga shells
You got it out the mud I got it out the oil


Sucking on me buckling my knees throw a bag at ya'
Molly feel like Hercules when a nigga jab at ya'
Hold on wait, hopping in the Wraith
Stars in the ceiling like I'm livin in outta space
Maneuver like a boss we don't ever leave a trace


I be going up like a balloon
So many bitches might catch me on Shade room
Free all my niggas like a movie they coming soon
Takeoff!

Play with the dope in the snow like a hockey puck

Michael Jordan I'm perfecting my craft
No money counter, count it up with my hands
Young nigga, I can show you how to do math
Sippin' on drank, I pour up some muddy
My nigga not tryin' to remember my past
Don't come to my hood if you ain't got a pass
Eat up the dab like linguini and crab
Mr. McMahon, I fire you and your staff
Watchin' you niggas dabbin' made me laugh
Dabbin' is a way of fashion, touchdown like I'm Takeoff McFadden
Call a play like I'm Takeoff John Madden
Should get a platinum plaque from all this dabbin'
You niggas should get a Grammy, the way you actin'
Enough of that swag I put it in a casket

No temptations, Migos sensation
Seen a lot of faces, why not make a Young Rich Nation



You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet

She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars
Everybody know lil' mama on go
Everybody call her hundred gobbler
Got hoes on hoes like a roster
Is it because of my posture?
But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father
She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket
And break your wallet, and you know she got it
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket
You can not play me
You know you're too wishy washy
Kick her out the house politely
We noticed you was too excited
No we not going for it, no we not going
You're too wishy washy lil' bitch and you know it

If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit
She givin' up her pussy for the profit
Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it
She really wanna be on red carpets
These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible
Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach
These bitches are funny
They're tryna take a nigga's money
I don't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing

Neiman Marcus shoppin', she want me to spoil her rotten

That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas
Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She askin' me where my umbrella
Fox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla
Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand
She know how to work the pots and pans
She watchin' me like I'm on demand

You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet
You know these hoes wishy washy

But really it's the red dot

Fucked a bitch and hit the lot
Nigga fumblin' with the pot
I broke my wrist in the pot
Hit the block, brought back a knot
Kept me runnin' from the cops
I need everything in stock
Act pints in the attic
Fucked the bitch and broke her back
I fucked the bitch and gave her back
Thumbin' through a hundred
Thumbin' through a hundred racks
Know you ain't one hundred
Your chain might get snatched
I wanna whip up some pies today
How many niggas gon' ride today?
How many niggas gon' slide and grab on they nine

Jump in the crowd and get live today
Heard you talkin' through the wire today

It's been a long time coming
From young niggas to young rich niggas
It's DJ Durel and I'd like to welcome you to Rich Nigga Timeline

Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out "Free Actavis"
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T pity the fool
Master P, No Limit money, bando jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me 'til a nigga be cumming

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewellery, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

Hit a nigga with a choppa only one time
And I got the pocket rocket and it's on me all the time
Technical foul fuck nigga crossed the line

One gun with bout 200 round

Lemme fuck something one time

Only take one time for me to call my niggas up and they pulling up
Thinking bout running up

My mansion's got expensive furniture
My stingray Corvette, it come with the turbulence
Hit the gas one time, it's over with
I'm in Vegas in casinos and I'm betting my poker chips
Just like a spider, I web up the game
People they think it's Peter Parker here
One song Versace and it got us the fame
Niggas plotting, get one shot in your brain
Niggas biting but ain't gon say your name
Migo my family, only one gang
I came from the Northside and invaded the A
Start fucking up the city now we got our own lane
Now we blowing up like we on a mine
Givenchy khakis, Versace down my spine
Speeding in traffic I'm doing 200
That nigga say fuck the stop sign
Taking your bitch and I fuck her one time
But that bitch she be calling me more than one time
I drop a 8 one time, y'all drinking one line
You ain't never seen a hundred thousand dollar one time

Lemme fuck something one time




Migos! Metro!

Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces

I’m walking around with a pocket rocket, don’t run up on me lonely
Bought my first Audi with the fish scale guts
Now I got the bitches, wanna fuck, they wanna cuddle up
Wanna come to the bando, knock two times then twist the handle
Got everything in stock, whatever you need, just ask me
I’m selling that kush to Asher, Rel Money, got a whole bag of Ashley
Money taller than mountains, drinking lean out of damn water fountains
She so bad gave me erection or eroused, whatever you call it
Bitch, me and my team been balling
Bet your label keep motherfucking calling
Woke up to a bitch this morning, got 16 new text message

When I was a kid all I wanted was a hundred dollar bill
Now I’m 19, young nigga want 100 mil
Selling whole things, want an ounce? Can't bust the seal
Wanna be a trapper? Never serve a nigga where you live
In the Bando counting chips no poker, weighing bales of Okra
I got lots of O's, put my name right next to Al Capone
I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Selling that dope to economists, menace to society
On the top of the mountain, you under me
Young nigga, I’m trapping and grinding
No scale for the workers, I'm eying it
You niggas still nickel and diming
Remix the dope and you niggas still buying it

All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces

Fuck it I’m smashing that bitch
Young rich nigga with the Rollie wrist
Trapping and capping, I’m selling the birdie
You fuck niggas really ain't serving
Selling the bricks to the plug up in Berlin
Put the dope in the water, hit it with the egg beater
Sipping lean, yeah I'm good on tequila
My neck is so sick, got the measles
This for my my niggas that trap in the Regal
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Put the molly on top of her tongue
She sucking and fucking, she ain’t got no manners
Back to the basics, I’m counting these faces
My pockets inflating off trapping the babies
You niggas fugazy, my niggas, they strapped like the Navy
I’m the mayor, matter fact, I’m the president
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
Throwing the bird with accuracy, all of you niggas is amateur
Pull up in Phantoms, but trap out of Challengers

All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces

My plug Carlito, he can't speak no englo
All he knows is "andale"
I got bandos for the L-O
State-to-state, no real estate

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird

They said it was called the trap
But on the north side we call it the bando
Yeen’ know
Naw for real

Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin’ ‘bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
I been teaching niggas lingo like I’m a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked ‘em up with the dab, so we goin’ up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

Ta-Ta-Takeoff
When you trapping keep a shooter at the front door
I’m so high I just need a wall to lean on
Slap a nigga with the Ric Flair robe on

Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin’ ‘bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
I been teaching niggas lingo like I’m a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa

I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep

Don't fall in love with the fishes
Do not get drowned in the water
I don't wanna call her no more
Cause my niggas think I'm gone spoil her
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it
I'm in way too deep with the digits
Falling in love with the Benji's

So deep in the game I might drown
I play with the fishes, no flounder
I sip on the Actavis, it keep me grounded
You niggas ain't shit

But I stand tall
Locked up behind the wall
Making county calls
Remember the time when my teacher said I wouldn't make it?

I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas

And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep

Don't fall in love with the fishes
Do not get drowned in the water
I don't wanna call her no more
Cause my niggas think I'm gone spoil her
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it

Falling in love with the Benji's

Deep in some water
Fuck yo fish

Lame ass nigga gone go for that

Where were you
Where
Where were you...

Where were you when I was whipping it in the kitchen
Where were you when I was jugg finessing midget
Where were you when I was facing time off tickets
They wanna come around
Where were you...

Where were you when I was beatin' the pan?
Choppers imported from Kazakhstan
Where were you, Where were you when the eggbeater was in my hand?

Where were you when I was whipping it in the kitchen
Where were you when I was jugg finessing midget
Where were you when I was facing time off tickets
They wanna come around
Where were you...

But you wasn't fucking with me when I was stacking that guala
I call up my shotta I send him the dollars
You sellout rapper at the bottom
Double G all on my collar
Bitch say she wants red bottoms
Paying tuition for college, wait
Baby just look at me honest
You wasn't fucking with me when I was at Onyx
For money, back then I was boring, hell no
Big ass bank rolls won't fold
But where were you when I was broke

Where were you when I was whipping it in the kitchen
Where were you when I was jugg finessing midget
Where were you when I was facing time off tickets
They wanna come around
Where were you...

As I remember
You quitted on me you surrendered
You pretender, acting like you was there when I was up in the blender
I'm the number one contender, don't hold grudges because I am a forgiver
You niggas make me have a bad temper, ?) said that offended her
I'm still trying to figure out
Where the fuck you was at when a nigga couldn't get out
I'm rich as a bitch with a smart mouth
Like Martin do Pam, bitch get out
Excuse a nigga if I'm acting rude
You was not there when I had no food
You want to start over I'm not a fool
These bitches not loyal she broke the rules
Trifling bitch I'm not wifing it
Left a nigga when I got indicted
You fucked my partner tryna keep it silent
My diamonds shining like the police sirens
My plug on the boat like a pirate
Pussy niggas they don't like me
Real niggas fuckin' with me
Baby girl you wasn't with me

Where were you when I was whipping it in the kitchen
Where were you when I was jugg finessing midget
Where were you when I was facing time off tickets
They wanna come around
Where were you...

Pull up and wet up the city don't care about no feelings
I shoot at your children
Pull up and kill 'em don't care bout no feelings
I pop out and shoot at the city
I'm cooking big birds and chickens
I pull up with tons and tons of them midgets
I'm going far as the stars, are you afraid of heights?
The sky is my limit
You're bittersweet like a lemon
Hey I'ma move you up to Beverly but not the Center
Hey Young Thug gon' bite that fish just like its tenders
The way I'm geek'd up don't know one of my members
Hannah Montana, banging in red bandana
10 thousand dollars toe ring right inside of my sandals
My bitch understand us, she ride with the nana
She got her a lawyer not goin' to the slammer
Imma pull up leave it running, I walk in the club
Don't play I snuck the gun in
My bitch think she dreaming cause I grabbed the Tommy
Cook so much dope it startin to look just like comic
It could make a young kid vomit
Catch a dumb ho, hook her up to phonics
I'm slick and ironic

I'm taking your bitch out to Beverly Hills
And I didn't give her nothing but a molly pill
I'm the Fresh Prince and I live on a mansion, young nigga my daddy not Phil
Me and Young Thugga we drank muddy trouble
My pockets inflating like I blew a bubble
When the mixtape dropping Migo?
In the kitchen and I'm whipping the pot
Short with the gwalla, I'm coming at you like the headhunter

Pull up on you and your people
Me and my Migos illegal but that choppa legal
Guiseppes Zanotti black and white, they zebras
Set the bitch off like I'm Queen Latifah
In Puerto Rico kicking it with Carlito
He put me on Chico he gave me a kilo
You fuck niggas taking my lingo
Pull up on you get my shit back like I'm repo
Thugger my brother we got different mothers
We fucking these bitches you cuffin' her
Bet you don't know she be sucking me while you've be kissing her!
Offset fucked her, Quavo fucked her, but you fucking that bitch with no rubber
These bitches be trippin', fucked all my brothers

Pull up and I got the Tommy aim it at yo' head I turn it to an omelette
I'm connected like Vonage I run to the money I'm faster than Sonic
You an informant I hang you like ornaments
Got pics in my mansion Mozart did the portraits
Got your bitch in the condo I'm all in her ovary
'Sace my chest out like I am with Jodeci
I'm a wizard with bricks, Harry Potter, do sorcery
I'm at the top and no nigga is over me
Run in yo' house like I'm Jeeper Creeper
Pour a 4 in the 2 liter
Christian Louboutin, walking on hyena
Straight out the trenches I use an egg-beater I whip up a beamer
Beat it like Tina, beat it like Jackson
I beat the pot my knuckle got a damn fracture
Add up the digits my nigga money on top of money, fractions
My niggas they all about action, no camera
Pull out the choppa, it hit yo' ass hard like the judge, with the hammer
You niggas is monkey
That's why the choppa got a Hundred-round hanging, banana
These bitches be asking me questions like
'Offset why the hell you walking on mammals?'
Bitch because I am an animal
Watching me like I'm a channel
I got the white call it Pamela, Anderson
White Lambo Jennifer Aniston
Black diamonds, I call it African
Offset fresher than a mannequin
YRN plugged in with Rich Gang
We got plenty money, diamond chains

I drank a 4 and now I'm leanin'
She drank her a 4 and now we leanin'
I didn't even cry homie
How I feel when I lean...
How many, how many, how many, goin with me
How many Ms, I got circles ain't no Mickey Ds
Migos got a birdie of it
Throw away the cutlass get a Panoramic
Hey, Mama gotta mansion now she perfect
Spared my last mill but it turned out to be worth it
She just wanna do it for the Vine
She just wanna do it cause she know that she a dime
If you ain't got no rollie she do not waste her time
I don't want your weed boy you're smoking on pines, nigga



These bitches see a young nigga
Cause I'm walkin' round with these hundreds
And I pull up in that Lambo
So fast you ain't even see me coming
I got chickens out in the country
Got a AK finna start drumming
You was talking shit behind my back
But now here a nigga you ain't sayin' nothin'
Young rich nigga live forever, my trap game A1 clever
You say that I'm broke how dare ya'
I ain't never goin' broke never ever
Your arms and your legs I sever
Then feed em to the sharks for dinner
Quavo too hot like a kettle
Young nigga and I keep the heavy metal

Life is a gamble game, wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
They wanna fuck with me cause I'm a millionaire
Spectacular, the choppas in the back and in the Frigidaire

Pulled in my driveway, it's really late)
They parked in, man I cannot see the tag
But I see a badge, 12, time to shake
Fuck, I rush out my backdoor
Trying to grab all of my cash flow
Jumping these fences don't know where to go

The witness is who you going to blame

It's a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist
You showing your benjis on Instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting

Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
I ride 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it!"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting



Started with a dollar and dream
From riding Impala with them things
To driving Ferraris with them wings, nigga
Young rich niggas, Migo, Meek Milly

Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!

When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's

When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now


Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator

I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "give a nigga some faith"
Now when I wake up I look at my lake
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!

When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down

Pick a shoe, pick a shoe, pick a shoe
They asking bout what it is to beef with you rappers
Sorry I don't want an interview

They investigating like the Blue's Clues

Broke as a bitch nigga, pitiful
Locked up doing time, Lambo no mind
Jesus pieces, nigga spiritual
I just woke up in a mansion
Wondering how the fuck did this shit happen
The blogs, they say I be snapping
Making a movie, lights, camera, action
I'm beating the pot, knuckles gotta fraction
We invented the flow niggas got it packed
When we walk in the club we the main attraction
Too much smoke in the room, breathing like Toni Braxton

They callin' me samurai the way I chop the top
Steve Nash, I pass the rock
Shaquille O'Neal  how I block a shot
Three Amigos I might chill at the sharks
Booting your bitch up with molly rocks
That Rolex ain't real if it tic-toc
They asking me when is the mixtape gon' drop
Peekaboo all of my diamonds shining
Pissy my diamonds in China
My necklace dripping down my spinal

Wondering how did I get rich with these felonies
God keep on telling me;

Yo, jumpin’, jumpin’, jumpin’, jumpin’, jump jump jumpin’
My money always jumpin' out the gym
No basketball though

No Clyde Drexler money
No Dominique money
Jumping out the gym

Money above the rim, Burberry Timbs
Bands jumpin’ out the gym, no Shawn Kemp
Back then she ain’t want me, now I got her salty
Cause she seen Young Quavo flexed up in that Aston Martin
Hurricane wrist, watch Young Quavo break the pot
In the VIP shootin’ nothing but money jump shots
Can't nobody touch me cause my goons like secret service
Pull up, pop the trunk, it's a flock of birdies
I already know she thirsty
So I put her in the kitchen dancing dirty
I already know he a coward, I already know he sour
He a snake in the grass so I had to cut him off
I call that Georgia Power
We don’t even kick it like that dog
Quick to spray a nigga like Lysol
Don't get mad at me cause I smashed your bitch
Then I passed her like Chris Paul
Hell nah I don’t need no label
Hundred bands just sitting on the table
Face card so good in da hood
I could go kick shit wit Blocc Gang in Decatur


Eighty piece teeth, Girbauds with the crease
Aw shit look who it is, the white Dominique
Dominique Wilkins, more dough than Homer Simpson
I can ball and tell more story than that Rumpelstiltskin
I done shine different, but I still diamond glisten
Wood wheel twistin’, mysterious roof missin’
40K on wrist, and I’m ballin’ fierce
I done shot more jumpers than that Paul Pierce
Or Kevin Garnett, 'cept I don’t even break a sweat
I’m flying learjet, all-glass clear jet
Me and Migos stackin' C-Notes, DJ Drama
We on vacation, we skyscrapin’ in East Bahamas


No I don't really care, Dr. J
Money jumpin’ out the gym, Wilt Chamb
Hook shot like ‘areem Abdul-Jabbar
Or lay it up like Nate Archibald
Twenty-one bands on me, Dominique
Shoot a nigga lights out, Pistol Pete
And I called them birds Beyonce
‘Cause they look good and you know they gon’ sing
Thirty birds call them Bernard King
Got thigh, got breast, got wings
Robin jeans got studs on the denim
I dropped three, it wasn’t nothing, Reggie Miller
Man I’m jumpin out the gym, Yao Ming
You're short similar to a Pygmy
A nigga keep a steel like Stockton
Black and grey monster truck, David Robinson

Want to talk about dabbin’
Stackin’ money ever since
Keep it a 100, I’m sick of this bitch
Taking a trip, I’ma give her the dick
Chew it up, eat it up like it’s a Twix
Go see your jeweler my nigga, you tripping
Your diamonds so little that they got me squinting
I forgot to mention you tryna get a verse from me
Then I go 24 karat my kitchen
Who the fuck said we ain’t plugged in the city
Never mind, niggas done turned into crickets


Pistols, hammers, AKs, bananas
Dirty Diana, on molly, dandruff
This my propaganda, riding ‘round Atlanta
I see a hundred cameras, doing shows in Alabama
I’m not your average rapper
Come to my trap, I’ll tax ya
My diamonds came from Africa, like Michael Blackson
I spent 10k in Magic, two bitches fucked my fashion
They think because I’m rapping, Houdini won’t do magic
Working the water in Atlantic
Money stretched out to Kansas
Big body panoramic
I told your bitch to get to dancing
Shoot a nigga, hit the canvas
Get off my grass like I’m Stanley
I’m higher than a chimpanzee
Ranked number one, my standings


Chew my dab up just like it is Trident



Hit 'em with that sack, uh oh!, fumble
Little nigga smokin' mid, give that pack back to your uncle

I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man

Quavo, Quavo
Talk to Scooter in Dekalb ,  Quavo, he said "you a road runner"
Free my nigga Offset, ASAP, so a young nigga can get back to the money

I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man

Egg beater my left, Pyrex pot my right
Baking soda on the shelf, beat that pot like Winky Wright
Ever since my daddy left, Mama taught me "son do right"
50 niggas to my left, 50 niggas to my right
50 chickens come a day, 50 chickens come a night
When I whip my work today, They gone find yo ass tonight
All my niggas on go, you know they gone smash on sight
That shit you rap and talk 'bout, nigga, you know thats my life

I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man



I don't need no shooter nigga
One gunman
I just dress in all black with my gun, man

Don't move in camo
Gloves on, no evi
Trigger finger, forever ready
One man, out the jungle
One machete turn you to spaghetti
One bullet, one headshot
It's sad to say it made his legs lock
Don't call the cops
Wrap his body put it in a box
If you the huncho then you make the drop
Gotta pay for the dirt that you're doing off top
I pay for mine when I see his head
That's the same way the gladiators did
I'm the gunman but I love the kids
Quavo Superman, Quavo John Wick
And you don't want the two to mix
Have a 4th of July on the 6th
When you're broke pay the bills bitch
But when you're rich you can kill shit
I'm John Wick with the black tints
Got gun peepholes on my car kits

All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
All black, one gunman
All black, one gunman
All black, one gunman

A nigga turned into John Wick

But they still tried me like my name was John Wick

Bodies poppin' up unfortunately

When you plottin' on a nigga shit get ugly
Call of Duty shit
When it come to the artillery, I'm very talented
Takeoff Dahmer, I be killing shit
Mini AK with the banana clip
When I travel put it in my travel kit
Rick James, I'm rich bitch
Momma told me I'm a walking lick
The trap game is Madden, no need to ask Madden
I just hit the plug with the hitstick
No Santa Claus I'm on my Grinch shit
Fuck it might light the block up like it's Christmas
I'd be a fool if I leave a witness
Come through your chimney into the kitchen
Scope on the chopper, I see you chillin'
Hit you and your wife and I leave the children

All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
All black, one gunman

All black, Hatchback
Got the chopper in the trunk of that
Kidnap the nephew where your uncle at
Selling the junkie stepped on like a welcome mat
Feel like the president since they killed Pistol
Got the pistol looking at you now you sentimental
Thinking to himself how did he get up in a pickle
I can get you knocked down by a nigga want a nickel
Hail Mary
Make it look like Halloween up in February
Birds in the trap singing Mary Mary
Bullets tickle your stomach like Pillsbury
Look for him everyday till you find him
Cut off his wife's finger to remind him
Send him to kill ya that’s an assignment
Set this shit on fire change the climate
Throw the body in the river, up in Winder
I'll get you knocked off even if it's minor
Cooking up the dough sneezin' fuck with my sinus
I'm with the shits fuck nigga
I'm John Wick
Hit his ass with the gauge and it hurt my wrist
Reach for the chain and his body glitch
50 Cent AK the magic stick

All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
All black, one gunman
All black, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman

I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!


Lost my daddy, young nigga I was only four

Got my momma on my back, she really love me though
Taking all this pressure so I had to pull a kick door

Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel

Front row, courtside at the Lakers


I don't understand you, you speak Brokanese
Never play piano but I whip with lots of keys
Trappin' and cappin' the fishes
Bando smell like Captain D's
Talking to my plug, Jackie Chan in Japanese
Private jet to Belize, smoking OG Christmas trees
You niggas ain't speaking my language
Ain't got a dollar you're so Brokanese
Why you niggas pocket watching
You need to be stacking that broccoli
I am the father and you are my son
I'm mister Miyagi and that's why you copy me
You niggas so broke it's killing me
That was embarrassing, really ridiculous
A nigga still on the block
Selling them quarters and mention my niggas been dealing it
I travel overseas, I water whip in The Bahamas
In Australia I'm the crocodile hunter
In Africa in the jungle




Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

Young Rich Nigga, I'm draped up in Versace
I went up to the jeweler, when I left I'm playin' hockey
Bad bitches like it, she see Rarris & Buggatis
I'm poppin' bottles in the vip, she rollin' off a Molly
Fendi Prada Louie bally, I don't need a stylist
I'm takin' all my goons to Cali, then we hit the islands
Order up 500 1s, I throw it all it follies
Plug in Japan, so we kick it like karate
Bad bitch from Switzerland, her daddy G. O`Donnie
Every time I'm on the phone we talkin' 'bout some money
I weigh it up, and wrap it up, I ship it across the country
The streets a concrete jungle, play the game like it's Jumanji

Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

My pockets is sloppy, only buy Rarris and Gottis
My clothes are exotic, Versace you copy
Migo gang is my posse, takin' over like the Nazi's
I just got out the county, money old like Bill Cosby
Hunnid bands, in all hundreds, when I make it rain it thunder
Cop a Lam every summer, wrappin' bricks like it's a condom
I'm a rich nigga bitch, don't even think about licks
Slap a nigga with a stack, then I piss on that bitch
In the club sippin lean, but I'm still buying cris
Shawty wanna talk to Offset, bitch you ain't on the list
Don't mix the lean with the sprite, drink my mud out the seal
I'm in Louie and Bally, I rock my bitches Chanel

Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

Young Rich Nigga follow me like Twitter
All green diamonds on my neck look like the Riddler
Red white & green Louis bought them on the day of Christmas
Im the teacher you the student put you in detention
I got the camic you my chef and put you in the kitchen
Now you dirty dancing boarding wippin washing dishes
I took yo main bitch and then I turned her to my mistress
Pull up in Audi pull up in Rarri whip full of net it is a mystery
The rich nigga of the century its going down in history
Energizer bunny wrist keep going it got energy
Back then you ain't know me now that sack make you remember me
Got that 45 for my enemy tell the Lord forgive the sin in me

Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas



Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life

Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec
When I went to the jeweler didn't know what I wanted
And I told him as long as my diamonds are wet
I am a blessing and you are a curse
I only finesse the plug with words
Placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put 'em in a car then a young nigga skurrt
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walking round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, balling like a Net
And I got a Asian plug, no Jeremy Lin
Let the top back, let your hair blow in the wind
Finesse the plug, I don’t need a Benjamin
Judge out of trial so you know I'm innocent
Smoking on gas blunts longer than incense

Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life

Juug, Finesse, Steal
I gotta have a mil
I was raised on the hill like Jack and the Jill
Do anything just to pay them bills
My brother caught 15 waiting for the pill
When a nigga broke, he coming at your throat
Tryna' sell the coke but it really is soap
My lil' nigga Shad got smoked
Hungry for the money, trying to get the dough
Shit get real, nigga tried to kill
All this bullshit for a dollar bill
Hoes set you up, they don’t give a fuck
Tryna' get ya bucks, watch who you fuck
Plug’s like a socket, gotta keep the rocket
Tryna get a profit, running to that money like Sonic
All my cars robotic
No Master P, but "I'm Bout It" gone

Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life

Finessing and flexing like Wrestlers
Indian plug in that castle
Bald headed Jag, got cancer
Turn your main bitch to a dirty dancer
I’m cooking and wrapping them chickens
Finessing these niggas on tickets
If I fuck with ya, I’mma give you a straight drop
If its anotha' nigga I gotta remix it
Flipping them patties like Krabby's
My shoes is Prada's or Bally's
Finessing since I can remember
My wrist so cold, December
I’m selling T-bones, they tender
That steel wrapped around me like Bender
Difference between me and you
I'm real and you a pretender

Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life

Money growing like Pinocchio, nigga, but I ain’t lying
Most of these bitches ain’t mine, I fuck them then move down the line
See that cocaina gon’ bring you to crime
And that cocaina gon’ start bringing the fire
But get caught with that cocaina get time

Migos!
Talk to em Takeoff
Takeoff, Takeoff!

You niggas be bitin' my style and I like it
But you niggas know you weren't rapping like this
Whippin' that dope with the terminator
My mansion got 80 acres
They wonder why I got the Bentley, the Fisker
50 pairs, Giuseppe steppers
Maison Margielas, they think I'm on Rocafella
I got the Britney, the Whitney, the Iggy
Hannah Montana, fuck nigga we been in that Coogi
It's time to kill em' with Givenchy
Red bottoms, scenes are forensic
Designer frames, limited edition
Fuck nigga wanna clone?
Fuck the fame rather be rich
You waiting for it, then here it go, the intro to No Label 2

QC, It's funny my nigga right
Cause everybody wanna sound like us
But they don't wanna give us the respect, right?
You fuck niggas gon' learn we started this shit
We the first niggas to come out the A, on that real street shit
That real Northside shit, holdin' their muthafuckin' county down
Not city nigga, county nigga
Tell another nigga to do it like us, nigga
QC the label, money on the table
Migo Gang, No Label!


Gon!

See, I learnt the term from my nigga Biggie, right?
We went from ashy to classy
We went from having shit to fucking your bitch, my nigga
No Label, DJ Ray G
These my muthafucking brothers right here, Migo Gang
What niggas you know made a million in one summer without flipping bricks?
Ask your favorite rapper
I bet he say us, nigga
QC, the label
Hah! No Label!

You making me sick to my stomach
Labels wanna sign, that ain't on my mind
Mansion Elan was our stomping ground
Taking shots cause your buzz died
The world is fucked up but the strong survive


Haha, name your favourite club in Atlanta, my nigga
We ran that shit
We turned Mansion Elan
Into Migos Elan, nigga
We turned obsessions, in the Migos Playhouse nigga
Every strip club
Our main bitch, our side bitch, her side bitch, her side bitch worked there, nigga
We run this motherfuckin' city
We started new Atlanta
These niggas jackin' our swag, they better stand in line
And pay, bitch!



Yeah
Migos
Bars, bars, bars, 16 bars
I don’t know

You take the deuce of that yellow then drink it
I be like, “Damn, boy!” what is you thinking?
When I hit Henn' bitch fuck it, I’m swinging
Walk in the Nawf, you know that they banging
Dope boy mentality, dope boy mentality
I feel like Takeoff, yeah we moving to Canada
I got the chopper don’t challenge us
White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don’t give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I’m sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it’s recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I’ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don’t imitate, the dab I create
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I’m on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don’t beef with no rapper it’s a money race
It won’t be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
Put a ‘tato on the K
It gon’ be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight

Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table steak and a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It’s a good day today, I’ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don’t speak or say “Hey”
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
Don’t come out the house, you can’t make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I’m cashing out
Used to tell them folks “Put your shit on layaway,”
When it’s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don’t say nothing, Domingo gone get ‘em
After you get ‘em, Domingo gon’ split ‘em
Can’t let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can’t afford a fender bender
Now I’m fucking bitches and I’m Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain’t gonna shoot it with ‘em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain’t talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain’t gon’ give ‘em non’
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas; I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain’t hearing none of that
All them niggas stick ‘em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on ‘em make a nigga do jumping jacks

I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I’m running, I’m not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Muhammad Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I’m a Nawfside lil’ nigga, don’t fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can’t remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap ‘em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deuce deuce in his crotch
Don’t be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage ‘em
Ready for war, ‘case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset; they start to go panic
They know I’m no bullshit; I’m ready to damage
I’m screaming out, “Fuck it,” my cup is still muddy
Don’t kick it with niggas; don’t play “buddy buddy”
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil’ babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It’s cheaper to leave her; I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra

Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy



Take it back to the nawfside
Migo N.W.A nigga

Woke up quick at about noon, just thought that I had to be on the north soon
Hop in my Beamer to see my moms, my mom started trippin' 'bout my stinkin ass bong
Stopped at the gas station, get it pumped by the bums
See some niggas that ain't like where I came from
I grabbed my Glock then I dialed one number
Tell my brother that I'm slipping and I'm in trouble
So the nigga I don't like made a move to the right
I grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight
The nigga to the left told me put the gun down
BOW one round, Uh, its going down
I ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit
My migos pull up with macs and sticks
Rel hopped out and let 2 shots off
Then I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law
I rolled down the window, it's the officer
Put his nose in my car, he say he smell the herb
He opened up the door and asked me can he search?
Hell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?
I'm worth a million

Rockin' down Boggs Road seen a punk ass busta
Got the 38 on me but this bitch kinda rusty
Fuck it i'ma shoot it, if its jammed then I'm running
BOW BOW BOW BOW, crumping must be from Oakland
I ran through the cut, 12 chasin' me
Smoking on gas got the best of me
He getting so close, bout to tackle me
I turned around and emptied the clip, get from round me
It's fucked up, niggas in the hood they killing each other
And most of us got single parents, only a mother
Niggas in the kitchen whipping chickens, tryna get butter
Police on my ass cause the Budniks on the Cutlass
Police pull me over got the mac in the back
Wait till he get up out the car and hit the gas
High speed chase down 29
And if I get caught I'm gettin' a lifetime

Once upon a time not long ago
3 amigos by the name of Offset Takeoff Quavo
Stayed on the north side, thats where anything goes
And if a nigga disrespect, he meet the funeral home
Wake up in the morning, thank him cause it's me that he chose
Migo Jerz at the bando with a fork in a bowl
My nigga called me at the park and said its getting too deep
Jumped in my R8 with ostrich seats and hit the streets
Ridin' down club drive feeling myself
I know the block is hot, I'm screaming fuck 12 sparking a spliff
My conscious telling me you tripping Takeoff think I see 12
Damn I shouldn't of served that nigga at the Shell
Now lemme tell you a riddle
Mirror mirror on the wall, what would you do if police told you pull over your car?
Mirror, when do you picture the Migos falling off?
The mirror said you stupid boy, don't ask that question at all
I see red and white blue lights as I look in my rear
Put the gas out, it's Friday and it's smokey in here
Fuck another high speed chase, that's when the hemi kick in
Forgive me for my sins, I ain't going back to the pen
It's gon be a...

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I’ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking bout where you been at
And why you ain’t pick up your phone?
I’ve been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun

Okay I be on a private jet to Portuguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain’t never seen
The OGs keep telling me boy you gon make history
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes I make her panties leak
She still probably won’t believe so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it’s all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me

All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun

Quavo talk to em' ooh
You know you’re shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my god what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I’m a young nigga, ain’t used to relations
So you know I ain’t patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don’t eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That’s my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I’ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room

That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun

I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I’m a player
I’m not used to cuffing the women but I’m gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain’t no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it’s too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I’m kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I’ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room

So what part of Atlanta y'all from?
From the north side
Uh, yeah
Every show get crazy and crazy
We growing and growing every, every, every time at a show

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

We killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands
Mommas and daughters taking a picture with me and they smiling
Billboard magazine, 45K
Word on the street they say the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it
Check my schedule, itinerary loaded of course
Check my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas is righteous
I don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces
The chains on my neck, I might get arthritis
YRN Tha Album first album going diamond
Got my mama a Benz
Just to show her I'm grinding
Green dots in the pen but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds
Dropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

Skrrt, cook up
Graat, he shook up
I'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux
My niggas got grenades and bazookas
On the private jet we smoking up in indica
A hundred thousand, got a pick up in India
Headed to locker, we changed the millennium
Thirty thousand for a walk through minimum
Snakes in the grass start spinning out venom
That come with the territory when a nigga winning
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
The blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image
Your CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler
Choppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion
Came from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach
I'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing
And if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys
Never see me lonely, best believe nina on me
Stuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

Pyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up
They looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up
Came in there right and we fucking it up
Jump off the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up
But these niggas still don't get enough
Niggas with attitude don't give a fuck
Young nigga flexing never did a push up
Migo flow everybody wanna look it up
Every ten years it's on my story bro
I bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it
Yo favorite rapper he be biting
When I step in the booth, its a moment of silence
I bet yo bitch she get excited
When I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous
I need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
Can't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up



Huh, turn the headphones up
I mean just a- yeah, yeah, you good
Let me turn these lights off
Let me fire up this cookie real quick
You know how we get it
Can’t find my lighter though
Migos
Young rich niggas
Young niggas been doing real boss shit
They know where they got this shit from
Ask about it

You gon’ put on for these bitches
Young nigga I came from nothing
And now I’m at parties with Diddy
See at first they didn’t believe me
Now this shit coming way too easy
I’m with a paid assassin
We the ones came up with dabbing
We put ‘em on trap fashion
I made a play out in Athens
I’m whipping up Kylie Kardashian
Same niggas see me having
Used to be the same niggas laughing
Now my palm itching
Now my palms itching
Came from bomb pitching
My mama be the witness
Free my convicts
That took a long sentence
All my niggas came from the north, they born menace
Ay, ay, no Kanye
I walk in the trap, play with yay
Call up the lean, pour an eight
Then pop an eight, tray tray
Then I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay
Bitch, I came from the trap
Take her phone, she wanna snap
I don’t get no sleep, I just take naps
I look out the peep, 12 at the trap
I look out my peep, 12 at the trap
Ay, my nigga gon’ run with that sack
Ay, my nigga gon’ flush that lil pack
I jump out the window then forty yard dash
That’s the shit I used to do in the past
Now we through playing, we playing with cash
Droppin my top just to dump out the ash
Wrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash
Let me take it back just for two minutes
Fourteens and the nines, had tools in it
And you notice that it didn’t have windows
That the first fucking million dollar bando

Some niggas came in the game dancing but Migos you know we came in with the fashion
Ain’t talking ‘bout Donatella but we the most underrated rappers reppin’ and havin’
And they wanna know why we pressing these niggas, they don’t let us in they facility
Cause if you ask me I feel like I should get a percentage the way they be stealing me
Elmo, these niggas they tickle me
Drink codeine and trap out the embassy
Mama said niggas’ll envy me
Behind the lot shootin’ at my enemies
Quavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly
Drinking codeine, moving slow like a centipede
We brought that flow back when niggas didn’t know
People compare Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
I put my blood sweat and tears in the game
And I still got more years so I bet they’ll remember me
All of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays
When I start spitting I ball cause it’s inner me
Remember taking trips in the Infinity
Looking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin’s
Gotta stay low key cause witnesses snitching
Who the fuck told ‘em north side wasn’t the trenches?
These niggas bitches, they want some attention
Niggas get put in detention
It ain’t my fault, nigga, it’s your decision
No presents up under your christmas tree
Cause I am the Grinch, stole christmas
Wonder why your children not watching Disney
Cause Migos we making a history
I bought twenty pints of Activis
You think I’m sellin’ em, but that’s just for me to sip it
If you don’t believe me you can ask Quavo, matter fact Offset was right there with me

Offset!!
History repeat itself, I got locked up again
I came home to the Benjamin’s
As a young nigga they always envied me
You copy my dab, you lil niggas are mini-me’s
My necklace it cost me a brick a piece
Fuck the bitch so good I make the bitch’ knees week
Dropped the top off the Bentley, it’s up to me
I sat on a milly while I was in custody
Picked up my stick, hundred rounds in my clip
Double cup of Actavis, I pour a couple zips
I’m that same nigga that jumped in the VIP
Lot of niggas pussy ‘cause they know that I’m a killer
Made a couple million, but the bricks up in the rental
We was in the bando, trapping, capping, I remember
I really beat the nigga, caught a pussy nigga stealing
Get hit with that stick and I bet you gon’ feel it
Pull up in Maseratis, where my ceiling
I see a nigga plotting, where my semi
I can whip me up a brick in a minute
Throw on Margiela one day, then Givenchy
Got the game in submission, your bitch in my kitchen
Don’t care ‘bout no ho cause that money my mission
Chill Will want a body, his finger been itching
And my Ferrari got bricks by the engine
Don’t fuck with no rappers, these fuck niggas bitches
I’m not being friendly, I don’t want to kick it
Didn’t write no letter, you niggas ain’t visit
I took a plea, I said fuck it, I did it
YRN 2, nigga listen up, hear it
We back on our shit, you can’t fuck with us period
I see a million when I’m in the mirror
Get hit with the Glock and I scrape off the serial
Hop in the Lamb, hit the gas, hit the gear
I got a shooter with me, he right here
I got your bitch suck my dick, on my leer
Police be watching me like a premiere
Put that lil bitch on some molly
She ride on my dick like a trolley
All of my cars are exotic
Knock a nigga off, don’t get indicted

Eating up rappers, they boneless

I call my niggas to stick ‘em up, give it up
Shaking like a stripper, tighten up
Migos Wikipedia, you can type it up

These niggas drinking on Robitus’
Give ‘em the bubble guts, serving detention bus
I put that bitch on the perk, she can’t get enough
Put that dick in her mouth, tell her pucker up
After I fuck that bitch once, then punt
I told these niggas ‘bout flipping and whipping the chickens
I gave these niggas the flow that they using
And niggas they act like I owe ‘em some
My plug he just touched down in Lebanon
He teach me the game like he Farrakhan
Leave that and walk into Mansion

My niggas came from the corner
Eating up rappers, they boneless

Mama she told me I'm wise, looking at Benjamin Frank in his eyes
I'm taking the plug to Hawaii, I'm chopping on bricks circumcised
My bitch, she came from Dubai, she got that good brain like Devry
I'm smoking and leaning and driving, I hope I don't get DUI
Watch out for the snake and the lies

She say that it scaring her like peek-a-boo
I take her, go dab in the mall
She walking out, Christian Louboutin shoes
Came from 100 bands in the trap hound
To making millions on the mic now
Remember the days in the bando
Used to pull up, it look like the white house
She act just like me and she humble
She look like her mama
She can get anything from me, keep the hunnas
But a nigga gotta get the commas
Remember the days, suprise on your birthday

I know that she loyal, know that she loyal
Know I gotta go spoil her, gotta go spoil her

All y'all vehicles old
Baby girl want some new
She say she want the 2014 Bentley
Baby girl, what you gon' do?
Is it me, is it me? No I think it's you
No offense to you, but I ain't spendin' my money on you
She said "no, baby don't go"
But I ain't spent my money on a bitch since 1994

Pull up Audi like the raider
Your bitch wanna fuck with my pimpin'
Cause I be drippin', dabbin' all on your bitches
My pockets is fat, but my pants leg is skinny
Louboutin pennies cost a pretty penny
My bitch is so bad like I Dream of Jeannie
Phantom pulling up, after that Lamborghinis
Magically takin' your bitch, Houdini
I call her my chef, order linguini
I take her, debate her, I trade her, I might hit her later
My niggas bust her open like a baker
I fucked her, I skeeted all over her naval
I call my partner, pass her to my neighbor

I put a mil in the attic
I fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict
Percocet, molly, and Xanax
I feel like I land on the planet
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs

Percocet, molly, and Xanax

I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs

I put a four in a liter
I used to trap out a Regal
My mom used to trap off a beeper
I look at the molly and eat them
I am all out of narcotics
All of my bitches exotic
You niggas drinking on Watson
I keep the chopper for plotting
I keep the white like cotton
Look at your pot, it's rotten
We're never going in a drought
Junkies coming in and out
I used to run in your house
Wrapping up you and your spouse
I used to be sleep on the couch
And now I cash out, no amount
I pop a Perc and then I'm out
I spent two million on a house
Run the money up like a route
Sober niggas out of style
Cobra niggas get the power
Fifty thousand for the style
I'm in the Coupe with no miles
Balling like Darius Miles
If you own the drug I’m on, you need to pull up right now
I pop it off, feel like a ghost
My niggas doing the most
I'm never gon' set up my folks
I got more sand than the coast

I put a mil in the attic
I fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict
Percocet, molly, and Xanax
I feel like I land on the planet
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs

I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs

Slipping, cripping, drinking blood
Short bus shawty on the school bus
I think I'm on everything but the dust
Itching like a junkie when I'm on Tuss
I pop a Perc and the Vicodin
Grab me a Fanta, I'm spiking it
Dab in Designer, they biting it
I hit the mall and the pharmacist
These broke niggas drinking on Qualitest
I take off on drinking on Actavis
Hope they free my nigga 'Set in the set
Fly like a plane with a Louis baggage
Curling Backwoods, step into the maximum
Plug on Designer drugs and I'm taxing them
Step on a brick in Givenchy
Moving slow, drinking breast cancer
I pop a test, jump in a tesla
Put down a brick, served a pedestrian
So many bricks, they think I'm a Mexican
Put on my reading glasses with finesse
Hold on the white, she gave me Becky
Pop the pussy like a Smith and Wesson
Fucked that little bitch at the Westin
I’m on a 'shroom, extraterrestrial

I put a mil in the attic
I fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict
Percocet, molly, and Xanax
I feel like I land on the planet
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs
I'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs

Niggas see you getting money, plotting, tryna take it from ya
It’ll hurt you if you know your right hand man, he telling on you
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana

He used to beat me, told me nigga get some muscle
If you can’t beat em then you gonna have to bust em
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a strap said I wasn’t going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the sack then my niggas kidnap, call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kickin' in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that’s the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed

Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis"
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity"
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown

When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run
I didn't know if I was comin' home

You can hear the pain in my voice on my songs

But I do really fuck with you, like everything that you do and she know

Fuck all day, fuck all night
Where ever the fuck we want to
I enjoy all the time that we spend, but it never seems to last
Now I gotta get back to the cash


No matter how far I go, lil mama she coming to get me
She do what she gotta do, she independent

She know why young nigga a hustler
Got a young nigga's back when I’m trouble
Got the body of a goddess, Brazilian mixed with Scottish
She exotic, she come from a island
I can trust her in the trap, she ain’t gon steal my dope

Different color diamonds, Willy Wonka
Never talk to your honor
I plead the fifth, I make sack for the summer
Ran up my sack, I’m addicted to commas
Only can sleep on the lean and the coma
Walk in the store and go talk to the owner
Trap on the block, the bando on the corner
Having artillery like I’m Osama
OG good gas, you can smell the aroma
President tint like I’m riding with Obama

President tint like I’m riding with Obama
Where is Michelle?
Take over in your city like I’m the mayor
Beat the bricks in the V12
On the block serving the bales
Ducking and dodging, I’m running from 12
Takeoff ain’t taking no L
Cause I keep the steel
Nigga tryna bite me, Holyfield
Hundred round drum, overkill
Think I’m in the Navy the way I be poppin’ seals
What you wanna do?
What you wanna be when you grow up?
Fifty migos when I pull up
Hundred hoes on my tour bus

Damn, who the hell is he?
Extendos and choppers whenever we pull up
Gold on my like Slick the Ruler
Shout out to my jeweler, iced out my Frank Mueller
Iced out my Frank Mueller, my neck is a cooler
My diamonds albino, I’m counting these riches, no Lionel
I’m smoking a pound of that OG, I’m reading the bible
I’m playing with the rifle, I think I’m a sniper
Two twin choppers like the towers
For these stuffed crusts you gon’ need ‘bout three lighters

Pocket full of Jackson, where is Michael?
When you walk in my bando, see dirty diapers
All I ever wanted was a sack
Every migo in my hood kept a strap
Fuck up a check, I’ma get it right back
Once I kick me a door or get it back in the trap
I remember niggas sending shots subliminal
Tweeting on Twitter so it got political
If I ever see you it’s gon’ get physical
Texas, lone ranger, danger, no Mystikal
Christian my Louboutin’s, Giuseppe steppers
I might just go Maison Margiela’s
Like I’m Rockefeller, fly like a propeller
My diamonds they can shine in any weather
Boxing rings on my knuckles, Mayweather
Yes this is real fox fur, fuck nigga
Cover my mink chinchilla
What to do you want be when you grow up?
What did you want to do when you got up?
I hit the lot, copped an Audi
Went to the kitchen, grabbed the spatula
The stick is magical
Beating babies with the pots and pans, shit is tragical
I’m the ambassador
Pull up in a Lamborghini, it’s an Aventador
Independent nigga riding with a hundred mil
I can get a life sentence
Block hot, 12 on a nigga cause they heard I jugged about a hundred pigeons
Red on the bottom my Louboutin
At the court it’s silent like I’m Jack Nicholson
Still got the pocket rocket, never catch me slipping
Master P, I’m ‘bout it

Quavo!
Talking to my Migo plug about the zone
My ho is so nasty, she wanna drink a nigga’s chromosome
She got the ass shots like Cortisone
Head shot nigga, Houdini dome
Fifty M’s nigga, having a house like the SIMS nigga
My nigga boot up like the timb’s nigga
Baow, kraow, go kill nigga
Gold bars they in the mansion
Work the bitch, they dirty dancing
Yeen never seen this much white since Marilyn Manson
Old money, nigga Jurassic
Two hundred fifty in the cabinet
You’re the type of guy hanging with them fuck niggas
Flexin’ like they havin’ it
It’s Migo Gang year
Choppers making you stare
Be aware
You better take look in the mirror
Cause all of my niggas they wild, they stand on the chairs
Cheers, beers
My diamonds lookin’ like ‘em
Two bitches, bet I dyke ‘em
They riding on my rifle
The fuck nigga lookin’ wrong, so I’m gonna check him
He don’t think that I’m gonna shoot him
I’m gonna bet him
Kung pow, choppin’ bricks like wow
No Chris Angel
Diamonds shine, gold bangers
Pull up to the club lookin’ like a fucking stranger

The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward
Fifty chickens on the highway, it’s gonna bring a hundred more
I can touch down on the plug, I just scored
Hundred round on the chopper, oh lord
Connected to the streets without a cord
A hundred bricks up on the boat, all aboard
I call it Givenchy, Balenciaga
Coming through your window, call me Roger
It ain’t ‘bout a dollar, then why bother
The gold on your neck look like copper
You snitchin’, you must be a crime stopper
I’m selling that white girl, call it Mary Poppins
I’m pitching the work like a quarterback option
Double cup filled to the top, pure toxins
I am a leader, niggas follow suit
When I got to the church, diamonds on me, no suit
This is a family, not just a group
My niggas stick together, we win or we lose
Beating the pot and I gave it a bruise
These bitches they ain’t shit, they fuck you and your crew
Stomp on you niggas like I am a cube
OG gas bag is smelling like pubes
The devil fucking with me then he get rebuked
Fifty floors up, nigga what a great view
I just beat the cause my lawyer a jew
I’m sipping on Actavis, good on the brew
What a miracle, I’m living superior
Niggas can’t fuck with us period
Niggas be hating, say that we not lyrical
Stand on the stove and I’m whipping up chemicals
Finessing the plug and I’m acting delirous
Jumped off the porch ‘cause a nigga was curious
You live and you learn off experience
Better do better, nigga get some Benjamin’s
Open your ears and my niggas just listen
Me and the pot got a very good chemistry
Used to fail chemistry, now I pull up in the Bentley
Now these niggas they gon’ envy me

YRN the Label
This shit a lifestyle
It gotta be in ya
Not on ya
Haha

And counting them M's, living life high like Invader Zim
Live for today and pray for the next, I only see money

Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
Got 50, 60 grand, 5 100 grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go

And I get high with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeaaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeeaahhh

I'm like "hey, what's up, hello"
I met you in the kitchen whippin' in a bando
And Imma need you to cook a baby
And when you cook that baby, I'mma buy you a Mercedes
Look at the thighs on her
Oh, I wanna ride on her
And we in a coupe goin' crazy
Go to Venezuela, that's a getaway vacation
She the trap queen, she cook it
I'm the trap king, I bring the cash
You a pussy, so I took your bag
If you get money with your baby say "yeaaahhh"

The Audi, Bugatti, Ferrari, the Masi
The Bentley, the Fisker, the Jag, the Rover
With a bad bitch like Hova
My wrist it be spinning and spinning like it got a motor
Fifty bricks in the Toyota, trapping off the motorola!
Through this same time, it was last year
Migo gang still with the top,  Migo gang
Niggas wasn't fucking with me
Now they wanna fuck with me
Cause they see on tv in that Versace
I know that they hate it, I know that they hate it
I know that they praying we won't make it
Momma told me, "Son, you gon be the greatest
And you know that you gon always have haters."
16 stuffing zips in my windbreaker
Hanging with the OGs and the killers
Then that windbreaker turned to a chinchilla
No limit money nigga like I signed with Percy Miller
Whipping it, whipping that Hitler then hop in that Fisker


It was all a dream like Biggy
Grind hard, committed, Migo gang lieutenant
Lost a lot, now we winning
From the Hondas to Bentleys
First of all I wanna say ... fuck the feds
Wanna see a nigga locked up or dead
Straight up out the county, straight to the fortune
Remember back in the day broke on the porches
Smokin gas, sipping mud, driving in them Porsches
Now we traveling the world like a fucking orbit
Thousand dollars pair Giuseppes, no more rocking Jordans
Fully loaded Rolex for my son, Jordan
Now he looking up to daddy like my daddy important
Rolls Royce or the Maybach, that’s boss choices
Kick this shit like I'm Chuck "Offset" Norris
Rasputia my pockets they fat, don't mistake me for Norbit
WHOA!


Ever since day 1, had to juug some
Momma told me, 'better not run into these houses son"
What you mean ma? We gotta keep the lights on
She said, "Quavo you might run into the wrong one"
It was 2 years ago, it feel like it was yesterday
Task force around my house looking for a case
Turning on the channel news then I see my face
Turn myself in cause I know my lawyer beat the case
Then we dropped Bando, hoes go loco
How dare a nigga ever disrespect the Migos
Could see that hater look in the eyes, the way we hit em by surprise
Cause we blowing up like inner tube tires
Now look at my life rocking the ice, rocking the mic
Now my hoes a different color, looking like Mike & Ikes
I hope I motivated young niggas to get their money right
Now this is for the people let em know that we some young rich niggas
Now this is for the people let em know that we got way more than one hit single
GONE!
Young Rich Niggas 2 ...
It's a blessing ...
From us to you ...




From the jail cell, my wrist so sick it got sickle cell
Working my wrist like a ferris wheel
You say this and that what my pocket fill
We don't spare no nigga, cut his head off and show me he's real
We got diamonds and gold ain't no stainless steel
Independent we didn't take a deal
I know you heard about the fight
I know you heard about the shoot
I know you heard a nigga ruthless
It's 50 thousand for a viewing
Bitch you see the dab

When I copped the Coupe they was mad at me
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Bettin' poker chips I ain't playing Madden
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my status
Passed chemistry and failed mathematics
Money counter do the adding
I bought a carpet from aladdin
So I can finesse and do magic

What the fuck wrong with these niggas
Acting like he don't really know a nigga
Acting like he don't really owe a nigga
Pull up on the block I show a nigga
It will blow a nigga ain't talking bout a motherfucking lawnmower nigga
Gas bags at the back door in the bando
Young niggas trap at the corner store, nigga
So many gold pennies on my chain you would think a nigga won a trophy nigga
Flex like a wrestler action figure
Hocus pocus pull up in a Lotus and my diamonds sick is like I got ebola
In the kitchen whippin' chickens makin' odour

Hold on Takeoff, hold up Takeoff
Hit the nigga with the sawed off
Then the nigga running off

Flip his body like it's fucking soft
Hole in one like we playing golf
Pass it to takeoff I bin and I call it the toss


I took your girl last night, I put her in the Lamb
Dropped the top, drop the top cause she know who I am
Showed her my pinky ring, man it's bout a gram
Every time she see me, get it and she know
Now when I turn my wrist in that bowl it's spectacular
Look at my pinky yeah it look like; it's africa
Niggas wanna be me yeah cause I'm a bachelor
Pull up on a nigga I'm smoking tarantula

Pull in a phantom and it Laughs

Bitches sucking me like I'm Dracula
Young rich nigga, get your camera

Wrapping the bricks and we send 'em cross the water, burrito


Ooh like lingo, money long like

Sipping on Actavis, oil fuel
The streets is like tug-o-war I got pull
Diamonds pissy shit on you like sewers
Rich nigga, smoother than velour
Must be kidding me cuffing that bitch you a idiot
Can't read between the lines you illiterate
The plug threw the work and I had to deliver it
Throw the money on the floor like i'm littering
You is a fool cause you don't take advice
Don't fuck with the snake bitch
The rats and the mice
*ring*
Can't talk on the phone about prices

Bitch I came from another place
Unfortunately we couldn't beat the case
Fuck it we outta jail anyway
You want the Migo gang? You got to pay
Kickin' in doors for the 10k, 14k, anything
Young nigga cashin' out for the change

Red and white coupe like a candy cane
Pop a perc, it feel like Bruce Wayne
Chop a brick like I'm Tsung Shang

Stop and get a play from cheetah
Quavo Derek Jeter, keep a street sweeper
I'm a salt water alligator eater
I play with water, you can check the meter
Cookie bag, that's my choice of reefer
Migo gang, aka grim reapers

Hit 'em if he cross the gun line
You holdin' yours? I'ma bust mine
He lookin' wrong, call it sus time

Ain't talkin' bout Drexler
When they come to that dope, nigga, I bet it's gon' glide
Ain't talkin' bout Dexter
Cook in the laboratory, Fendi frames on my eyes
Remember my pockets win the lottery
So every check gotta pay my tithes
Nigga tellin' lies just to cut time

These niggas flexin'
They talk about diamonds, they do not got VS inside 'em
I hit a lick, we divided it
Porsche with the gator inside of it
I'm on three Percs and I'm out of it
She gonna suck me up privately
I was young when the trap game adopted me
Grabbed the stick and shot his abdomen
Young nigga I am an arson
I got the pump in the cut with the carbon
My wrist cost a motherfuckin' 'Rari
I am a boss, I pull strings like a guitarist
You out of season, you need Lawries
Pull up in Beamers but trap out a Taurus
Look at the brick on my wrist look like Mick
When I got famous I darkened my tint
She took a mile when I gave her an inch
Won't sell my soul for some cash or a Bent
Hop in the plane and we land in Berlin
Christian Dior my bitch and her friend
Prayin' to God that I don't go again

Try the squad, nigga shots fired
Hit 'em if he cross the gun line
You holdin' yours? I'ma bust mine

Niggas that know me don't show me cause they know I got it on me
Feel like The Rock I'm giving out people elbows to all you Jabronis
Your niggas loaners my owners
Macaroni cottage cheese, 20 bandz in my Balmain jeans
No limit Master P, bout it bout it on the scene
When I take a piss, I see codeine
Hotboxin' backwoods in the lambo, can't breathe
If I smoke then it's expensive weed, I give you the sack if you find the seed

Feeling like Donald Trump, bitch you is fired
All my niggas blowing up like a fuckin' tire
Late nights in the bando feel like The Wire
My niggas heard that you snitchin, where is your wire?
And it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer

Wake up in the morning,  gotta thank God
Walking out the bando with a .45
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound
It's just another day on the Nawfside
I'm for real, nigga, you can ask about us, nigga
We earn stripes on the Nawfside
Just another day, just another day
Just another day on the North
Real talk, nigga
I know niggas took a loss, nigga
On the Nawfside, it's just another day on the Nawfside
On the North, it's just another day on the Nawfside

It's just another day, what is a day on the north?
Wake up in the morning, they kick in the door
We looking for money, we looking for gold
My niggas 100, my niggas on go
My niggas is trapping, dapping, what is you having?
Run with the sack and I go hit the hole
They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
I run the game
Look at my house, take a look at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day
I play the game like a game of spades
And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k


Nigga, they bucking, they rubbing, they sacking
Taking the pounds and breaking them down
What a beautiful day, my AK came equipped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
My young nigga hit a 100 band jugg in the club it was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side
Gwinnett County patrolling


Trapping on Club Drive, Migos the Army got Mob ties
We hit the ground, we had to do time
Kick in the door a million times
My nigga Westside he had to do five
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You gotta survive ,the streets will eat you alive
They say we wear make up, but that was a lie
Broke in them houses, no burglar bars
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard
I got a bulldog and it's gonna bark
You niggas is bitches, you wear leotards
Bitches they mad cause I broke their heart
Needed college, I didn't go to Clark
Beating the pot like it's martial arts




ZayMigo, ZayTiggy, ZayMigo

I put the bitch on the boat by the shore
100 thousand for my diamond Chuck Norris
I fucked your bitch, when she call I ignore her
Sold out shows went Atlanta, did Dora
On the jet ski with my Rollie in Florida
If I lose it, fuck it, buy some more water
Come back with the chopper like the game Mordor
I'm ahead of time, I bought a portal
I watch a brick cross over the border
I took her phone cause she a recorder
Quavo Capone, I give you tutorial
I'm the greatest you've witnessed, this shit is historical
Me and Nast talkin' mils
Shoulda played for the Bills
Still trappin', servin' wings
Buffalos on my team
Put the dope on the beam
That's the honest shit I've ever seen
Because the scale tell the truth
And the money counter too
Big chopper, that's a whopper
I tried to buy a helicopter
But instead I bought a Benz
Then disect the engine like doctors
I heard he was a crime stopper
I heard he was a crime stopper
He growed up to be a copper
I growed up to be a robber

Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
Coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers

What you gon' do when you look on your camera, them young niggas comin' in with the bananas?
They heard you been ridin' around in the Phantom, they watchin', they know that you got it
I put my ho on the mission, she fucked him, she watchin' his pocket
Where is my ski? I'm gon' have to kill 'em, I must have forgot it
Go get the F&N, cock it, screw it on, I kill you in silence
Wait, I thought he was straight, so why he keep hoopin' and hollerin'?
I was rappin' and robbin' while you niggas was callin' tip offin
Hit the lick for a Tec and a carbon
Write his name in with the permanent marker
I pull out the Glock and I aim at your carcass
Offset for president, vote me in office
I be movin' the dope from Dakota to Boston
I maneuver through niggas, you talk, they gon' off you
How you gangster when you graduated from law school?
When the police pull up you the one that they talk to
Watch out for your partner, he work with the law too
Fuck it, knock him off, I hate that I lost you
When I beat the nigga, tried to bring out a lawsuit
That's the type of shit a copper gon' do
Beg for your life like a hostage gon' do
I'm pimpin' your bitch in Vegas prostitutin'
Robbin' you niggas, fuck it, then I'm shootin'
If I rob you on accident, call up Ken Nugent
Qua' rock that nigga, he thought it was bookie
Head for Somalian, cook up some cookies

Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
Coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers

Coppers, robbers, mobsters, lobsters
Audi R8, no Charger
Private jet land in Pearl Harbor
Comin' up I was a robber
If it was worth the wrapper we did rob ya
Can't fuck with these niggas, they fakin', hatin', writin' statements in permanent markers
Money come back like it's karma
Diamonds, they bitin', piranhas
Make that bitch work, Rihanna
No Tarzan, but the jungle I conquer
Run with that work, don't fumble
Run with it Forrest, don't fumble
Rob a nigga like I'm Curtis Snow
But move like I'm Barrack Obama
I know a copper when I see a copper from  robbin' niggas, let's be honest
Takin' the adventurous trips, Jumanji, stashin' money in the dungeon
The difference between us fourth down, I'm goin' for it and you puntin'
After I fuck her the first round, tell that bitch not to touch me
Nigga's face look disgustin', come out cookie blunt musty
Bad bitch but she busty, she gon' take the charge for me
Kick in the door nigga, run it, make a move and leave ya ugly
What they sayin'? The cops comin', pussy nigga called the cops on me

Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
Coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers

I can’t love her, ‘cause she like a ghost
That bitch that do the most
She like ... ghost
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most


I got so many decisions, ravens fly with the pigeons
I beat the pot, while you be the witness, try me – we don’t aim at kidneys
I throw back a perc’ to call my tensions; we pipe it up in the city
I got your hoe in my DM’s; I got your hoe at my mentions
The plug, he live in my mansion
He got bitches in the kitchen dancing
Then they gone for a month
Then go to trapping all the way in Kansas
Nigga never rode a transit
Hit the pot, like a canvas
Feeling like Jamie Foxx, ‘cause I’m in love with a bitch named Fancy
This game is dirty like a fucking Banshee
When I started getting money, now you can’t stand me
I almost lost my life, one night in Miami
I go back to Miami, drinking out the hammock



I cannot love her, that bitch do the most
Want to slam my door, what you mad at me for?
Mad ‘cause I didn’t let you come to my show
But you calling my phone, standing at my front door
Is you mad ‘cause I didn’t take you serious, hoe?
Comedian bitch, you delirious, hoe
Kill yourself, jump off the building
I walk in the kitchen, grab the knife, and go slit your throat
I don’t do favors; you know that’s a no
Fucked them up on the dab, going up on the show
Kicking a door, when the bando get slow
F-f-f-fuck up the pot, they want more
These bitches give it up
I guess you want lust for the trust
I’m like a squirrel; I just want me a nut
Take the pot and I give it an uppercut
Most of these niggas be dick riding nowadays
Tell these niggas to wrap it up
Like an octopus, I’m getting money in eight ways
Young Takeoff, my stack is up
Since I remember, two years ago made ‘em say bando
Now they say pipe it up
Remember they talked down and doubted us
Now when I walk the Earth, I make the street erupt


I can’t be loving this hoe
This bitch like the green light; this bitch like to go
I gave her the Beamer; I gave her the Rolls
But this little bitch still gon’ creep on her toes
I see the moves, so I watch how I move
She fucking niggas; she tryna’ to be cool
She broke as a bitch; she got nothing to lose
Giving it up just to put on some Loub’s
How can I lie, bet that thing like a pool
All of these bitches be loving the crew
Ain’t no one on one we fuck by the two
YRN fashion, I’m dabbing on you
You mad at me now, so I’m laughing at you
You something to do; you get hit in a room
Mama told me not to jump over broom
They hungry for money, they tryna’ get grooms
I like this bitch; she got an attitude
I think that I like the bitch, but I can’t wife the bitch
I’m in a Lambo, look what racks do
Whipping up crack; I can make a deuce
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two!




You know, we seize the block
We need the block


Jumping off bags like a trash station
Pick up that shit like it's tissue paper
All my cars disabled

Young nigga holdin' his dick, 'cause he see the plot

Neighbors outside talkin' 'bout they smell dope

You better move, you better move, move it

When the plug make the call, know that I can move the ball
Nigga can you flip it all, can you make a fifty ball
In the streets I’m a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Selling rolls, no Quan, Roll Latifah said it all
Got to have a gas mask in the kitchen cause I cough
Move the work out to Memphis so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know that you false
Rick Ross ain’t the only nigga in the world boss
Put the Forgi’s on the old school, riding Chevy T-top
When a nigga walk up on me, freeze him like a freeze pop
Feeling like a DJ, hit em with the rerock
Feeling like I’m lost nigga rerock on the D-block
Fucking with the Chi-town niggas out in O-block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on your block
Nigga just was cooking, that’s the reason why the stove hot
Seeing money, in my dreams I had a bank roll knot

Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Two thousand dollars buy a bad bitch shoes
God done know she gone move
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back

I’m a criminal, I got to move my operation
You don’t got the money on time, my nigga what’s your occupation
We would never be in cases, never in investigations
Told em As-salamu alaykum cause my niggas kept it sacred
I’m feeling like Big Meech I got a hundred million in my vases
I got GD in my vessel, pistol popping like it’s kettle
I can make 100 thousand dollars with no effort
Got a thousand niggas with me, they looking for you like bounties
Imma put a tax on the gas moving out the county
Sipping Actavis, got me drowsy, trapping, capping, Maui Waui
I got bricks up in the U-haul, I got workers in the mountains
How fast can you count it, my nigga I don’t need to count it
You a cannibal, run off with the pack, eat em like animals
Bricks up in Florida, they calling me a Seminole
I know how to move em, Michael Jackson, I’m a smooth criminal

Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Two thousand dollars buy a bad bitch shoes
God done know she gone move
Pull out the chopper, everybody move

Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
You better move, move it
You better move, you better move, move it

Drinking on Activis, whip the work then I’m packing it
100K in the attic, I got the bricks in the cabinet
Though the work is immaculate, I be trapping and dabbing it
On the island I’m cooling it, had the kush in my Loubotins
That's an intruder in the window, I’m shooting, fly to Bermuda
Pull up with choppers with the coolers in it
I’m trapping, got a half a bag but don’t know what to do with it
Fuck a milli, bet a thou'll make your bitch get loose with it
Selling out arenas, fuck a nigga’s city up, we used to it
They never seen 100 thousand cause you niggas new to it
QC that’s the label got a solid foundation
My nigga trapping out vacants, we smoking gas like Jamaica
Black and white Bentley Musalnne but I am not racist
Traveling around the world to go get Benjamin faces
If you ain’t talking bout money then I get aggravated
Get up out my face if you ain’t talking Benji Franklins
Taking trips across the nation

Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Two thousand dollars buy a bad bitch shoes
God done know she gone move
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move

You remember that shit we did way way way back in the day?
We was some crazy young niggas huh?

I'd like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation
I know you been patiently waiting
Yung Rich Nation that's the album
Tryna turn the mansion to a castle


First check bought a Audi Coupe
It was black and grey like the Raiders
First check bought a Challenger
It was 10 bands so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset he got me high
That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out


Remember the time, I did my first breaking in?
Me, myself & I ain't had nobody wit me
Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up wit my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me
I know you remember that
6 period plotted on my teacher had to hit for that fundraiser fanny pack
Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that
Call the plug up ask him where he at
I'm celebratin' smokin' back to back
Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said "Damn boy I can catch contact"
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, hit a fat one when we hit for fifty racks

Really she don't know nothing, can't play a player
Baby girl I want you on the northside, welcome to my world

She ain't got nothing but a little back end
She hop in the front of the Bentley coupe

Trap money, me and my dogs spend it

When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

Remember the days with the pocket rockets
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
It’s a million dollars in the corner pocket
I just share the rock like I’m John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got 'stendos on their guns, they go up out it
Ain’t no need to talk about it
Megaton trucks, it don’t weigh enough
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks

Gas off in the back of the spinner bus
Say that you trapping, really you got touch and bust

Finessing the plug for his riches
Wake up in the morning, I go grab the spatula
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued
Double cup, a nigga still be sipping
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finland
I trap out the bando, don’t trap out the trap house
And whatever you with, we with it
Came a long way from that midget
Money taller than a midget

Giuseppe stepping, and my diamonds they compliments
QC my label, and that’s my establishment
Supercharge my Bentley, I call it Clark Kent
Me and my niggas spread the butter, margarine
Marvin the Martian, got Raris, I cut off the engines
Now park it
You can catch a bullet in your carcass
100 band juug, and you wasn’t a part
I took the plug off and we had a departure
You telling a story bout me, I’m the author
These bitches be choosing, they digging my posture
Whipping babies, I’m not talking bout toddlers
Similac in on these baby bottles
Little babies get stepped on they call me stepfather

Dope on the scale, man you never seen it

He a rich nigga boss up
She a bad bitch boss up
Broke bitch fall back


I got 200 G's
And I got 200 keys
And you know I keep myself protected with the M16
And I'm serving fiends, at ease the police
I do not freeze, I'm from the nawfside I use my two feet
I'm getting rich with my dogs, please do not get involved
All it take is one call, they'll come knock you off
If you're talking 'bout that money baby we gets it all
Touchdown with that dirty bird like I'm Jamal
Plug count the babies when I saw him said awh
Bitch call my phone, I had decline the call
Make like a season, bitch you need to fall
Niggas ain't shit, you need to change your drawers
Broke niggas got a reason to complain baby
I came from nothing rich to spinning like a Tasmanian
You walk around pockets smaller than a Pomeranian
I got owls in my house but I'm not Canadian


I ain't here for the foolishness
Slanging balls like I'm Ludacris
Your jewelry foolery
Your diamonds they ain't fooling me
I'm a boss from the nawf
Don't chase these bitches cause they flawed
I'm in Mansion with two strippers told them call when they off
Hit that bitch with that stick now he eat his food out a straw
Sippin' Actavis, I'm drinking syrup I don't got a cough
Fuck the media, they slandering my name in the blogs

Fucking that bitch and her cousin
I'm a rich nigga bitch I get more money than your husband
She a rich bitch, nigga you tryna spoil her she ain't want it
Woke up in the morning with two bitches made a porn
I didn't do this shit all by myself, I had a army
She a boss bitch, she pulling up in a Ferrari
Give me back my dab it don't belong to you, I'm sorry


I'm breaking that wall like a lumberjack
If police bust in my bando I'm flushing that
Rest in peace Pistol my nigga not coming back
Smoking on dry cause it come from a laundrymat
I got your bitch sucking me up, no Similac
Chopper nail a nigga like he a thumbin' tack
Call up Rel Money if you want a Migos show
Front end and back end, you sending that
If I take a loss I'ma get it back
They stealing the flow and I'm sick of that
Show me that pink slip cause you rented that
Ain't going back and forth cause I ain't here for that
Yung Rich Nation jeans, my thirty up under that
I've been balling but no Tennessee, plenty racks
They separated from the white and black mansion
No angry white people, we living that
All my bad bitches boss up
Broke bitches need to fall back
Nat nat alley cats
Back of the building fucking on my hoodrats
I'm dabbin' and watchin' like Cinemaxx
Dab on your bitch and I give her a heart attack
You still call it swag, don't call it that
And these niggas know we was the one started that
First I grab the mic, blow a stack, then I fall back
Racks and stacks taller than Shaq, but how good is your pack?
You need to get up and get off your ass and get you a sack
Ain't talking bout money, ain't tryna hear that then fall back

White bitches, snow bunnies, Mileys, bootin on molly
When they see me, get excited
Trap party, trappin' and dabbin' up at the Hyatt
007 James Bond, I'm movin' in silence
Niggas just like the ashes figured I try it
I'm feelin' like a doctor, all these fuckin' clients
Ya'll should bag it up, a young nigga get behind it
My jeweler up in the cooler you cannot find it
Before you walk my trap, I'm checkin' for the wires
I'm in the jungle with bears and lions and tigers
When I first seen a thou, nigga got inspired
A nigga trap in the nighttime, no Michael Myers
I be stackin' my money tall as the Eiffel Tower
Pull up on the block, I had to Forgiato my tires
Came to party with my niggas, they be gettin' it
Came to party with my bitches gettin' freaky
Hit the pussy with the right don't call me rookie
Benjamin Franklin takin' off bikinis

Came to party, came to party, came to party)
White girls poppin' molly, running round the lobby
Touchin' on their body, fuckin' everybody
Throwin' money up at Follies, make these bitches swallow

You can come party with the Migos and won't go home til the morning
You can come party with the Migos and won't go home til the morning

Sub-Zero tried to put a freeze on me
Insanity nigga they sleep on me
Plottin' on me from the top widows peak on me

Know when it's Christmas they come down your chimney
You know these bitches fuckin' for a fee
No it ain't Halloween but I still trick or treat
When we drop Versace niggas they copy me
Made the stocks go up and we didn't get no profits
Ain't trippin' on no money Donatello got it
Yung Rich Nation clothes the new Versace
Migos in trouble, Migos the topic
Migos go gold don't wanna talk about it
We brought the bando into existence
I should tax everyone of you niggas that rap about it

Flow Scottie too Hottie pull up in Bugattis and my plug is Scottish

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing

Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

You say you didn't see but you can't believe it
When it come to kickin' doors I make you believe
We took off the block, cold, anemic
Touch down on the north and I really feed it
Mama, she told me go get it, get it
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, "Boy, Quavo what's really in it?"
Down in Miami, the 305
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the 5
Stand up and bust with the 5

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork

I can't believe it, how I got these bitches
They suckin' me like they some leeches
These niggas, they actin' like bitches, they wanna take pictures
They not a rapper on a feature
Wake up in the mornin', I say me a prayer like a preacher
I teach myself like a nigga had a teacher
I got Justin Bieber in my cabin fever
Picasso pretty pictures is Mona Lisa
I can take a trip to Argentina, Indonesia
I don't need a fuckin' visa
I can't believe that we did what we did
But I pray to the man above, nigga we did it
Watch over my brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Dressed in black Margiela, I'm the Grim Reaper
Can you believe that we made a milli off of "Versace" money
Mentions ran off the meter

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door

Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

Achievers, you niggas just disbelievers
Used to be in the bando with egg beaters
You seen the first chapter, now this the sequel
I'm ahead of you niggas, we not no equal
That's the same nigga that broke in them houses
He ain't have no checks so he sat and accounted
21, I had a Challenger
Monitor had 20 thousand, I couldn't even count
My life start changin', these bitches got frantic
These bitches, they see me, they start to panic
Grandma told me better take advantage
Your situation, don't take life for granted
Prayed to the Lord and my prayer got answered
I pulled to the club in a Phantom
'Member when the police bust in, it was random
Fuck it, we took the rap game, held it ransom
Give it up!

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it

Plug sent me a bird it was heaven sent
If you ain't Migo gang then you irrevelent
Came in the game, I stayed and changed the game, a nigga talk slang
Rather be  rich fuck the fame
But some of you niggas change up on some change
I'm blowing shit up like Hussein
Any nigga wanna pull up with me, tell 'em pull up and just say their name
The chopper is 'bout to decapitate brains
All I wanted was the check
Diamonds on my wrist and neck
Making money, niggas calling me Meech

Quavo
Case closed, we can stop the duckin'
Went and did the show out there in Georgia Southern
Had a couple grams on us, large amounts of cash
Couple straps, they wasn't even dirty
We was super late, but they said be early
The other van had Rich and Murk in
Got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
That's when I knew that somebody was workin'
We the only niggas in the back
I had to hand big 12 my fuckin' strap
What I'ma do with my pack?
Damn, I put that shit right in my bag
12 lookin' at us, mad
Cause we thuggin' and our pants sag
While we're pipin' the stage up, doin' the dab dance
12 searchin' the van, damn
They locked up my driver, damn
Soon as we thanked our fans
We walked off the staged
Then walked through the locker room, they was cuffin' our hands
Hold up, ain't no talkin', no discussion
Shit, we all said, "Fuck it"
Whatever happen's God's plans

Migo gang back again, it's the three

Offset!
I had to sit down once again in the pen
Denyin' my bond once again and again
We kept it solid, don't fold and don't bend
Had to beat a nigga tryna steal up out my Benz
My diamonds be kickin' like Ryu and Ken
If I had the chance I would jump the fence
Sat on my box, read a book while I vent
Felt like I lost it, but I got it back
She archin' her back in the back of my hatch
I swear to the Lord that I'm not goin' back
Back on the road, 80 thou', we need that
Takeoff gave a hunnit, told me to relax
They set us up knowin' we stay with them straps
You not a boss cause it's somethin' you lack
Minor setback for a major comeback
Smokin' on gas, breathin' like Toni Brax
Back to the bando and back to the trap
Face in my Backwood, I'm not tryna match
Got on my knees and asked God to help me
Actin' like I don't know you like I got amnesia
Portraits in my mansion of Mona Lisa
My partners beggin' me just like they Felicia

Migo gang back again, it's the three
Minor setback for a major comeback

Muddy trouble on the way to Georgia Southern
Poured me a four and went out of it
Tried to hit a nigga in the head with so many charges
Should've caught a concussion
When I got to the show I woke up, didn't know nothin'
All I seen was police, sheriff, and drug enforcers
Took that, zipped up my hoodie then I got the TEC
But it's too late for all that cause they lookin'
Now it's 'bout time to walk into the buildin'
My gat's in my britches, I keep smellin' cookies
No this ain't a wrap, but I smell what they cookin'
When I was on stage, I didn't have a feelin'
That they was behind me plottin', tryna get me
If I knew then what a nigga had seen
Promise we would not be in this predicament
Had a zip in my net when I got jammed
Went to the toilet, threw and flushed it down
Lookin' cause it wasn't no cameras around
Autistic when they come to question on sound
Not talkin' so whatever you know, you found
But you ain't find shit, nigga, I'm not a clown
Searchin' so hard, left some drank in the ground
Fuck all that shit, my nigga's out the slam
Nah forreal, Takeoff!

Migo gang back again, it's the three

Pull out the MCM bag, got faces
Ride in the Bentley, they said I wouldn’t make it
My diamonds are Asian, I’m selling Caucasian
Walk on the block, the block is Cajun
BITCH!

Mansion for the bachelors

Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors

Trapper turned rapper
Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor
Flippin' your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas
Your ho was creeping like tarantulas
Migos we don't like the cameras
We find out that we can make millions with it
So we started flexin' like bachelors
Came from stashing money in the ceilin'
Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?
Came from kicking doors, juugin' plug for the bows
And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs
I don't see the millions that you pursuin'
Statistics in black and white, what is you doin'?
Top the charts every time we drop a new one

Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors

Migos, we the bachelors, we pull up in tarantulas
Whippin' the dope, with the Terminator break the spatula
Get the pack and then I wrap it up and then I bag it up
If I catch a mug I'll charge a private jet to Canada
Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager
Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders
My niggas on top of the mountain, no Grand Canyon
Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance
Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis
Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet
I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit
I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat
I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback
Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back
Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?

Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors

Pull up to the mansion, 50 story, hundred rooms
She lookin' at my diamonds, hallucinating on ‘shrooms
Hold a nigga rest and beat his head in with a broom
Got the bird that be flyin' like caterpillars out cocoons
Penthouse elevator, it'll elevate yah
Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper
Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
Got that price on your head, nigga like a alopecia
I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account
From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple
I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle
Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper
Just because you got a milli, you are not a bachelor

Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors

They don’t know nothing about me, know nothing about you
Keep it that way, cool, they don’t know
If I go way back we’ve been fuckin with each other since high school

17 years old nigga kicking doors
Couldn't even vote yet
Meditation of the mind was the greatest thing a nigga found
They recognize a nigga sound
And we didn't let the world down
Started with a brick turned it to a foundation
Turn the foundation to an empire
I'm the founder of Yung Rich Nation
And I still get recognized by my old patients
With a snaggle tooth smile he said he happy that I made it

I just wanted to be Recognized

Now I'm having recognition

If I got the feeling that I weren't recognized

Shoot your block down with the Glock like a alpine
Fuck it shoot the club up call me Shyne
These Balmains no Calvin Kleins
Flood my neck with that gold like Busta Rhymes
That Migos on the billboard worldwide we recognized
A lot of these niggas wanna be recognized
But get caught jammed up not gonna do the time
I know some niggas they got acquitted
And they didn't want tell and get crucified
I'm smoking on OG it ease my mind
Need some Visine cause I got the red eyes
Ain't thinking bout a bitch I'm getting money cause these bitches come and go like red eyes

Looking at niggas can't be mad at niggas cause nigga just want to be recognized

I just wanted to be Recognized

I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
Now I'm having recognition

Momma said recognize God

So I walked through the shadow, the valley of death
Pussy nigga taking selfies

Your momma keep calling say help
She didn't recognized you was a failure
I wanted to be recognized
Went to the mall and bought me a 10 and told the school it caught me five
My OG taught me to be wise
Thanking the lord cause I'm recognized

She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation

Quavo
She look like a godness, she tell me I'm hottest
I'm touchin' on her, rubbin' Benjamins all over her body
She got a flower in her ear, she look like she came from Hawaii
I'm lookin' right at her, I told her, 'Come here'
She told me she can't wait to pop it
I told her, 'Go pop it all'
Then she told me just wake her, she free tomorrow
No, I cannot go, got a show, 50 K tomorrow
Look at my face, girl, I'm hungry
Hungry, that's meanin' I'm horny
Got 'em on at three or four in the mornin'
Makin' her eggs 8 A.M. in the mornin'
You know that she naked, that's how she came in and made it
Wanna lock her down, wanna lock her down like it's slavery
Black and Asian what a combination
She turnin' me on wit' her conversation

Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation

She said, 'Daddy, come here'
She fell in love and a young nigga hit it
Smackin' her ass and I'm grippin' her titties
Can you handle it after the young nigga handled that?
Roll, roll, yeah, roll
Do not like takin', baby, take it all
You know we just started, this is a long road
Start it, fifty percent in trunk, that's a truckload
Conversations won't be in a Maybach
Conversations wanna temp, baby, lay back
Say say she hungry, I filled her the latex
No, baby, we gotta have safe sex
She so fine and I'm singin' her blues
I'm a beat it, beat it 'til it bruise
I know that she got some potential
Wanna see on your mind, what's your mental?
Lil' mama, I know that she gifted
So I bought her a Bentley on Christmas
Got on Louboutins, she got on Louboutins
I flipped your bitch and I know it's unfortunate
Perfect, heaven-sent, lil' mama got the whole package

Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation



We're not against rap

Fuck the media, fuck

Migo Gang, we the most dangerous
Narcotics made a nigga famous
If you bangin' twist your fingers
Throw a party for the gangstas

We the biggest gangstas at the top of the list
Gave my brothers no bond and said they a flight risk
They recordin', reportin', Fox 5 on my dick
I just gave them information 'bout my new bitch

They asking me questions
No information no participatin', ain't no conversation
They hatin' I made it, speculatin'
Takin' 'bout how many drugs in that vacant

Gangsta rap comin' back like a nigga got 80's crack with an 8-track
Come in your house, where the safe at?
Homey don't play that

Young niggas we bringin' back gangsta rap
I put that dope right up where your bitch anal at
My brothers keep a girlfriend in my cul-de-sac
When the white people see me have a heart attack, cause of that...

Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back



Ran from the task force, my lifestyle like a rodeo horse

Choppas eat you niggas like a termite
Bloody money turn to clean money
Fiend money that got bean money

When you a young rich nigga, you do what you like
Want a feature, nigga?, Gotta pay the price
Pourin' act in the cream soda, fuck the sprite
Cut the lights off and in the club, my diamonds bright
In the kitchen with the egg beater, Lamborghini, that's a two seater
Work come from Columbia, name it Catalina
Might just take a trip, just go to Geneva

Came in the game, we had somethin' to prove
Came in the game, we had nothin' to lose
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice

I just wanna wake up in the morning
Drop the top like I'm a samurai
I just wanna a hunna mill
House up on the hill
Sippin' out the seal
Lookin' at the sun rise
I just wanna look like  I'm a champion
I just wanna plug that's a Italian
I just wanna live better than average
I just wanna live up in the penthouse
I just want two bitches and they give me mouth
I just wanna make it out this motherfucking trap house

1991 I was established
Momma told me stop trapping and capping
Boy you talented
I did not listen so I ended up with the savages
Stuck in the county couldn't do nothing it was tragedy
I just wanna look like I'm the president
In the trap everyday man I had perfect attendance
All of the re up money I fucked up and I spent it
When I told my momma that we gon' be rich, nigga I meant it
I just wanna live like I'm a bachelor
Got the chef in the kitchen cooking up caviar
Doing hundred in the rari screaming fuck the law
Got the chopper aiming at you with the monkey balls
If I don't got the actavis then it's withdrawl
Got the pussy nigga missing like a sick call
I just wanna be on top and never ever fall
Up and downs in the trap like a see-saw
Trap, trapping out the gym without a basketball
I just want millions of dollars and partners that shoot you like shottas
I got two bitches they fucking and swallow
Don't love them just swap them


I just wanna be what I wanna be
Got two lambo seats in the old school topless T
Cruising like Penelope
I grew up on the westside of avenue
You can ask everyone about me
Game in a knot like a tennis shoe
What you gonna do when the feds run into you
I came from trying on clothes in the fitting room
To locking the doors in the Bentley coupe
If my bro drop the pack, then you know I got it
The coupe got the gadgets its like robotics
Giuseppe Zanotti it mark my body
Young rich nigga still walking round with the profit
Tell you a story about one little bird
One little bird when the pecking on the curb
Did he get up, did he fly like a real bird
Over the sea with the white like young Spielberg
30 pointer, 40 pointer
Look at the Franck Muller
Walk in your city
I feel like a king
I am the ruler
Who is the shooter
My niggas be trap off the calculator like computer

Ain't gon' lie, she rough, she tough, she might hit you in your stuff
Finesse you out of yo bucks and bring it to us, I fuck with the trust

Excuse me, you wanna do what?
Lil mama rolling on Molly santan

Drop in Orlando, I'm selling that magic
She calling my phone, harassing

Talking my head off, she all in her feelings
Asked me for money, but never ain't giving
Wasn't fucking with me before I had a million

You fucking me and you be fucking my partner
I know what to do, keep the bitch off my collar
Don't fuck her no more, then I cut off the guala
These bitches not loyal, don't trust 'em
Don't cuff 'em, don't love 'em, just fuck 'em
She telling me that she gon' ride, but deep inside I know that she lying
I know she ain't shit, she a dirty ass bitch

Forreal we were hot boys
Put the gun up in your mouth just like a Altoids
Chopper start snappin', gotta be a damn poet
We ain't holdin' no lean, go ahead and pour it
Skinny tires on the rari' lookin' bow legged
I'm a bachelor, I live in a mansion that's gated
44 to say bow!


Naw forreal, pints double sealed
And the OG gas bag come vacuum sealed
Remember kickin' in your door takin' flats
And the door stickin' out at my grandma crib
Trap on the block whether rain, sleet, or snow
Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Got excited when I seen a half a mil'
I was prayin' just to get a record deal
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

Finessing the plug with accuracy, now he after me
Got 100 Ps in the Sprinter, nigga no athlete
And I got that chicken, no Mrs. Winners
Meet the plug at the KFC and I finesse his ass after dinner
Call me Quavo the Godzilla
Red Bentley, Forgiatos on it, call it thriller
Diamonds thrill her in Manila
Fuck her from the back, I’m facing a pillar
You pull up with choppers but are you a killer?
Mirror mirror, got a riddle for you fuck niggas
What if you get in a pickle?
If you catch a body would you tell on your peer?
If you hold it down, keep it 100, you real
Samurai sword cut the brick, Kill Bill
I trap out the mansion on Beverly Hill
RIP to Uncle Phil, fresh prince, call me Quavo Will
I know that this money a blessing
I’m thanking the lord when I kneel
We the only niggas in the city having seals
Naw, for real!

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

Feeling like Marshawn Lynch in the interview, I’m thankful
Walk in the room with these trophies on my neck like you in a banquet
You acting like you really tough but you soft in the heart, you a diamond
Young nigga hopped off the porch, I was anxious
Just a young nigga old niggas embraced
Juug and finesse a nigga on my faith
Keep a little grip on my pistol, say my grace
We in the jungle, my niggas go ape
Whipping the dummy, this what I create
I fuck your bitch while you take her on dates
Nobody know I smash her on my lake
Talking fast to the plug, juuged him for 8
Stacking bricks, LA Clippers, call me Blake
Thanking the lord for my situation
Used to have bricks on the intersection
Sipping Act, daily medication
Who really real in investigations
You gonna tell because what you facing
He got out of jail and they couldn’t trace it
It’s a mystery, can’t even solve the case
Don’t be that nigga put on a plate

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

Finesse him with accuracy
Running with the work, police tryna tackle me
Short days, long nights, trapping at the Quality Control factory
Abracadabra, work disappear magically
I’m in the kitchen whipping, it’s a tragedy
Whipping the masterpiece, then I go smoke on my balcony
My niggas and family count on me
Trapping that snow white in that van, they calling me ice cream man
I see trash bags but no trash, nigga I’m the trash bag man
I see red and white blue lights, undercover lurking in the Sedan
Start with a cutie, break it down
Bag it up, wrap it up, that was the plan
Now I’m pitching soft and curveballs
Or I can pitch it to you underhand
Remember trapping out of Camrys
Until we won Grammys
Now you niggas cannot step on my property or my grass, feel like I’m Stanley
I took his bitch, he mad at me
Fuck em fuck em, pull up on him in the alley

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

When I saw my brothers on the TV screen, I was amazed

You lil' niggas only come up to my waist
And if it ain't dollars, you talking
Then, fuck nigga, get the fuck out of my face
And you been in the game so long
Why the fuck you wanna steal a nigga flow, anyway?
And no stopping me

Hey you remember that young nigga we seen in the hood
Aha, hell yeah

You remember he came out and told me that shit man

You turn a dollar to a million
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in an all black, like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his Mumma's house
That nigga burnt out
That nigga burnt out

Damn that nigga burnt out

Twelve got him in interrogation
But he burnt out he ain't singing
They'll give a young nigga a life sentence
If they ever find a fucking banger
He a young nigga still trapping and banging
Walk around twisting his fingers
But he's still in the kitchen and whipping the pot
Watching the dope look like it Kurt Angles
Hit the pot at every angle
In the kitchen and I’m cookin' Topanga
I don't really fuck with strangers
Never know he could be singing
If you want a hunnid we can arrange it
No refunds so it changes
You can test the dope with your pinky finger
Now he feeling like a Power Ranger

You turn a dollar to a million
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in an all black, like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his Mumma's house

The nigga walking with a dirty stick
Burnt out he looking sick
Robbing, finessing everything in sight
That nigga Debo cause he's taking shit
Young nigga fifteen and he with the shit
His brother just caught a charge for a brick
He sent the little bitch on a trip
To pick up some shit from the Mexicans
Momma preaching like a reverend
He a rookie wanna be a veteran
All he wanted was a necklace
And his trap game be excellence
He like the boot of the Hannah Montana
Young nigga burnt out like I blew out the candles
No ski-mask got a bag but she said fuck the cameras
Walking with a dirty stick long as an antenna

You turn a dollar to a million
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in all black, like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That nigga burnt out

Run Up on Migo Gang, Get Put in a Hearse
That Life you talk Is a Lie
The streets is Jungle You Gotta Learn how to Survive
Bitch Bench Press but I be movin' Weight
Is a trail Of Dope on the Interstate
TouchDown on the Plug Run Up in And Say
"You Livin' a Lie" and he Caught the case
You Flexin' Like Popeye Wit Spinach
Got 3 Birds In the Bottom Of the Engine
Pull Out the Rocket, He Pussy, He Flinchin'

Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking bout' cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it

Young nigga came from the bottom
Young nigga go get the guala
Trap out a hotel Ramada
They calling me Quavo Mufasa
Open the trap like carcass
We knowing you niggas imposters
They liking the Piña colada
I remix it with a lil' powder
Hit a nigga with a chopper
It will take about 48 hours
No Courage, you niggas is cowards
He got the pack and my niggas surround him
The Chattahoochee where they found him
My niggas go get the bounty
We hold em' up for ransom
If a nigga get hot, leave the county
Migos on top of the mountain
Listen up boy, it's a Migos announcement
I got the pigeons and falcons
Now I got the keys, I used to trap ounces
Came from the boards on the houses
Them niggas is telling I'm calling them mouses
Beat the pack like Ronda Rousey
Free Bobby Shmurda and free my boy Rowdy
I came from the pavement
Look at them niggas they mad that I made it
Look at their faces
Cause I'm at the top can nobody replace it
I used to be robbing
Hang with the goons, my niggas were goblins
Trap out the apartments
Turning the North side into a lil' Harlem

Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking bout' cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it

My niggas came from the pavement
So many chains like a slavery
Taking a trip to Croatia
Plug sent the pack be coming in from Haiti
Counting up these Benjamin faces
Young nigga I got rich off of Caucasian
Migo my gang, ain't no trading
Fucking these bitches, they from different races
Rick thorns, they came with no laces
Cooking up dope and the junkies gonna' taste it
Your bitch gave me brain, that's my favorite
Told that bitch watch her teeth cause' she got braces
Remember me nigga, gone' envy me
People gone' hate on me, just cause' I made it
Talk about me like we might be related
You need to sue your jewelry, Rollie outdated
Don't you twist your fingers if you ain't banging
I be in the bando with the dope boys slanging
Pouring up a soda, I leave it contaminated
All of my niggas that screaming out mama we made it
I know y'all niggas flexing for the check
Now one of them chains is yours around your neck
We start from the North side, screaming free offset
I gave him a test, get a vest, and then get hit with the Tec

Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement

You talking bout' cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces

Screaming out mama we made it



Don't turn that beat down Twaun
Turn that motherfucker up, nigga
Know what I'm saying, the critics said this, they writing that, it's facts they writing though, feel me

They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact

You say that there's a new flow in the game then that's a fact
Niggas be like Takeoff you done blew up like I might be fat
Ain't no vacation in this rap 'til I see twenty platinum plaques
On the block like I might be Shaq
Bought a spauldings just check my stats
Walk in Saks with a sack
I'm fuckin' up the economy like 80' Crack
Made a mil off Versace, independent, how you do that
Caught investing in yourself with M&Ms, nigga
Made a milli but don't think we don't got M&Ms


You niggas be talkin', you niggas be rappin'
That shit that you sayin' is not no fact
Back in the day I used to juug flats
My family proud of me no Kyla Pratt
Stomp a nigga out like I'm in a frat
You natnats bother me like a gnat
Hood bitch different color her tracks
Cookin' up chickens the babies just hatched
Fell in love with the lean I'm attached
I'm fresh and I'm dabbin', not talkin' bout wax
Fat blunts like a Louisville bat
I need all my money not takin' no slack
When you talk to a boss take off your hat
Break in these houses, free my nigga Mac
Bitches go both ways like Da Brat
You say not smokin' I make you relapse




'Know whatchua'll doin?
But I'm piped up
See that boy right there?
He piped up
See that girl right there?
She piped up

Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

Mike take some money and throw it
Might take your bitch and ignore her
I go to the club in Balenciagas, I fuck your bitch in some Jordans
Turn the hotel to the titty bar, get there drunk at the mini bar
I just bought a line of Actavis, I just pay like 300 for it
Alright I'ma focus on the pipe, my bro was on the white I will make him play, Rodney White
I will make him play, Julio, my trap pow where the studio
Process of elimination, this a real nigga invitation
This a real bitch conversation, drop the top for some ventilation
Yeah, my flow is hotter than an inmate on the conjugal visit
Tuggin' and kissin', one of these hoes ain't seen in a minute
I'm smokin' weed in the Emmys, I pop a pill in the Grammys
I be a live in Miami, just like I live in Miami

Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

Look, pipe that bitch up
Them bottles they light up my section
They lookin' off in my direction
Movin' my hood, bitch, I've been a boss
Weigh up the 9, said Aninia Ross
Buss' it up, cook it up, get it off
What you do with the rest, that's so and salt
They play with the sack, they gon' get the pipe
Then they gon' pull up and hit the lights
Hop out that bitch like I'm doughboy
125, that's a 4 boy
You piped up, then I piped her down
I'ma lil' wet, but, she gon' wipe me down
Ballin' like Birde above the rim
I rolled down the top like sun slip
I made the team, nigga, fuck the coach
Them niggas you made man you hate the most
Jack got 'em in, they fresh off the boat
Saw 2 of them bitches then bought a rope
Bentley GT doing drive-bys
Pocket G4 doing fly-bys
Church in these streets
Ya'll best tighten up
How much you drop when you pipe it up?

I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

Quavo!
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
She was a basic bitch til I piped her up
I'm just doing my dab, I called it the pipe it up
They know that I'm having blue Benjamin's
They know I'm on top of the pyramid
They know I'ma go down in Guinness
All this dab a nigga drippin'
Piped up in the city
Piped up with yo bitches
Piped up in Givenchy
Piped up new edition
When a nigga start talking shit, gotta pipe up the ammunition
Your bitch walkin' around piped up
When she see me, she blowin' kisses
Feelin' like Aladdin, Quavo the genie
I grant your ho three wishes
You know I do magic, Quavo Houdini
I touch the pack and get it missin'

Broke niggas still saying "turn it up!"
All my young rich niggas screaming out "pipe it up!"
Benjamins old they extinct like a dinosaur
Look at yo diamonds, yo diamonds ain't bright enough
I send the work to get used in a catapult
Play with the dope in the snow like a hockey puck
Pipe it up, pipe it up, no Roddy Piper
They biting the flow nigga but the Migos got the title
So now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen
I been touchdown on you niggas ask Madden
Don't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy
Pipe it up, bitch it's gon' be the new anthem
I come through swervin in a black Panamera
Pull out the camo when you see me Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal
Now remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up
Next thing we dropping, we gon' fuck em up, have everybody screaming pipe it up
Pipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs
A nigga fucking up the furniture
Shoot a money ball like Steve Kerr

Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up



I came from mug shots
To posters on the block
Keep our song on replay
Now all we need is 3 Mics and a DJ
3 Mics and a DJ x3

Know 3 young niggas on the North
By name of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff
We mobbing pull up at your house
Squad open the trunk and I pull out that sawed off
Cutomuto he gone cut your throat, Migos dressed in the cut knock your jaw off
I came from bitches staring at me
Now when they see me they taking their top off
Brazilians, Snow Bunnies, and I like Dominicans
Gold on my Giuseppe Steppers, red on the bottom on my Christian Louboutins
I used to be jugging, finessing, remixing the plug on the island like Gillegan
I gave em a flow, and they stealing it
The block on fire, I can extinguish it



3 mics 3 mics 3 mics nigga that changed my life
Mama she told me get right
No more standing over the stove at night
Now I rock the stage and I get paid, it's 50k in my resume
Remember hitting licks in the Honda
Now I'm riding round president tints on a Escalade
Picking hard ball like the Braves
Rocking out shows on the gravey
I told my mama we made it, Harriet Tubman chains no slavery
Breaking the sweat like the 80's
Play with the water like Navy
My niggas really in the field
3 mics we don't need a fucking deal


Back in the day a flamingo DJ Ray G playing Bando
That was the number one single
Bitches wanna come and mingle
Zonatti Guiseppe wrapped round my socks
We came along way from mug shots
Ducking and dodging the cops Ray G to me Offset stop
Offset never listen had to do a sentence when i got out we took to the top
They say when you worth a milli thats a different feeling
Wanna know benji im the definition
3 mics and a DJ shot fired on the freeway
Cooking the dope will get bagged like a replay
Running circles around you squares no relay





Go, go
Ay girl, plug send the pack yet?
Oh he did?
Leggo get it, Leggo get it!

Go Go Go
Go Go Go

He send me pack, that purple threat
He sent me mid, I sent that back
Put this shit on my mom
This Rolex on my arm
Cost a bird and a bar
Kra Kra! Got arms
Pull up in a ‘Rari, with the bricks in the engines
20 bricks in the floor, 50 bricks in the ceiling
Just smashed your ho, you don’t want her catching feelings
Migo gang my squad, taking over whole cities
Run up on me wrong, me and my nigga you better come with it
SA got crazy choppers, Mac 90 with the stitches
Quavo you did it, young nigga seen a milly
How long that pack gon take, goddamn I’ve been waiting for a minute
Gone!

Go Go Go

Plug just sent that pack from the left side of the map
Got bout 50 in my left and in my right I got the scrap
I put on my faith in goblin, god knows I love my trap
It’s all I know, it’s all I’m bout
Turned mama’s old house to a dopehouse
Moved her out to the suburbs, baby boy done growed up
Quarter milly in all hundreds in front of the plug when I showed up
He tried to sneak a couple blue dream on me
I had to tell that nigga hold up
Fuck you doing nigga, slow up
Before me and a couple side Memphis niggas come stick you and your ho up
Young nigga, 3 plug, 4 crib, couple hundred
That Bent that she loving on and hugging
I already fucked the ho, she ain’t nothing
It ain’t my fault, blame my connect
He keep it 100 and most of all he

Go Go Go



Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!



Yeah
Yeah
I don't trust nobody
I don't trust nobody
Uh, go

Running 'round the lobby, fucking with the bitches
I keep the extension, cause I don't trust these women
Geeking off a Scotty, running 'round the lobby
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I'll let you be the witness
Young nigga strapped with extensions
I don't trust these niggas, I do not trust these bitches

I do not trust these women
I'm gripping the strap when I'm pissing
I know that she fucking and sucking the squad, you know I'm not kissing
You be the witness
My wrist a tornado, that's a migo fitness
We mean the bidness, shout out to DJ Victoriouz, Longway he be cripping
LA fitness, on the treadmill chasing Benjamins
Got a thousand in your pocket, must be kidding me
I'm taking the trips out to Italy
I finger fuck the pot literally
Take a look at me nigga, remember me
I'm taking trips out to California and you know that I'm shopping in Beverly

Running 'round the lobby, fucking with the bitches
I keep the extension, cause I don't trust these women
Geeking off a Scotty, running 'round the lobby
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I'll let you be the witness
Young nigga strapped with extensions
I don't trust these niggas, I do not trust these bitches
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody

All I smoke is gas bags, just AK's and red flags
Made white girls love dreadlocks
Phantom Ghost from a hotbox
My lil niggas don't need much, all they catch is bodies
Didn't forget about it
Hop out, make all the profit

Hop out, make all the profit
Bomb in my left pocket, right pocket rocket
She give me sloppy toppy and I'm cocky
The block is so hot like a bag of tackies
Come to the north, it's a migo community
We go by unity, now we on MTV
You gon' notice me, check your boy Louie V
I'm dragging my Louboutin, fuck it, the mud on me

Running 'round the lobby, fucking with the bitches
I keep the extension, cause I don't trust these women
Geeking off a Scotty, running 'round the lobby
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I'll let you be the witness
Young nigga strapped with extensions
I don't trust these niggas, I do not trust these bitches



Huh? He saying what? He said that for real? Ha Ha. Oh yeah, he said that too? Damn


These niggas talk more than bitches
They tryna clock a nigga dollars
They tryna see if you a baller
Check the tag on your collar
Instead of hating on the next man
You need to try to be the best man
I think you got it from your girlfriend
Talking about bitches contagious man
You talking about Keisha
Really you acting like Keisha
You don't run it up you a runner
You grown but you live with your momma
All of y'all niggas be talking
And can't even pull out a hundred
All of y'all niggas jabroni
They phony they can't even keep it a hundred
My niggas came from nothing
They go to the bando and get them a bundle
Talking ass nigga you pussy
When I was 16 I trap out a onion
We put our stripes in the hood
Migos on the north, you know that we run it
These niggas talk more than Oprah
They telling the feds who done it


These niggas talk more than bitches
Go pissy fits niggas be bitching
You singing to 12, you be snitching
Quit the watching nigga pockets
Watching to see what he pull out his wallet
Look like you plotting my nigga
That's how you get hit with that pocket rocket
My niggas Aretha we got respect
Your niggas talk sweet on the internet
I know that you really getting finger fucked
But my nigga we not 'gone speak on that
Your CEO gay, need to see 'bout that
My neck got more gold than a treasure chest
You know that I'm having this manifest
I'm my brother's keeper no Malcolm X
These niggas talk more than these bitches
Wear panties and leggings
I'm laughing and giggling
These niggas they shopping at Tiffany's
In the city they Victoria's Secreting
Your money short like a Pilgrim
Niggas talk like Wendy Williams
Rest in peace to the late Robin Williams
Two years ago seen my first million











I done seen a lot of money with my eyes

Went to the jeweler, diamonds kick like Jackie Chan

Without no money ain't breathing
Drop the top in the season
Open up fire he bleedin'
Young Rich Nigga point fingers
Extendo with the scope on it, long ranger

Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out


Man I'm tired of selling bricks
Gotta know how I'm tired of hittin' licks
Can't wait till I sign that deal
The trap life, I'll give it up quick
Listen up, nigga speaking real shit
Cause it ain't all what it seems
You can have it all at one time, then end up losing everything
And I put that shit on my mom
Imma make it out of the slums
Imma get her in a mansion, in a penthouse, living lavish
We at the top floor of the condo
We ain't never got to worry about the popo
We eating on shrimp and gumbo
We smoking on blunts, they jumbo
I got J's at the front door
I serve them up with that combo
Got birds flying like Dumbo but I keep a 9 like Rondo
I locked the game, I got the code
Cash coming fast that pronto
Making plays, Tony Romo
Two bad bitches, they homo

Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out


Trap game risky but its so easy to flip them fishes
Fuck an iPhone, trapping off a Tracfone
Got a date with the money and the kush is my cologne
Sippin on lean out 2 styrofoam
I finesse a nigga for that cash in the red zone
You ain't never ever live the trap life nigga
You don't know nothing bout the rap life nigga
Hell nah I don't want to swap it out with you
Cause you don't even know what you taking bout nigga
I don't know you but I know you're not my crew
But a nigga never ever got gwap with you nigga
You ain't got cash, you ain't never ever sold drugs
You ain't never chop it up with the plug
You ain't never roll down 85 with a 100 birds in a Lamborghini truck
When I'm filthy rich thats when I'll give this trap shit up

Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout

I started kicking in doors, just for money

When I woke up this morning
I told myself I had to get some money
I can not hang with you jabronis
Cause you know that is not making me no money
I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money
I can't hang with all my homies cause they handouts
Asking for some money

I started kicking in doors, just for money
They'll do it for the money cause they know that I’m the boss
My niggas bout it bout it pull up with missiles and sawed off
We got the green like Boston play with the keys like I’m dealing sauce
Smoking on cookie I’m coughing
You think its a body got bricks in a coffin
Talking that shit then we off em
Look at yo bitch look at lil mama stalking she with me now you can stop all the calling
Play with the water like I was a Dolphin
Remixing the dope get a piece of a almond
You want that shit nigga stop stallin'
Free my nigga Offset so he can get back to ballin'

When I woke up this morning
I told myself I had to get some money
I can not hang with you jabronis
Cause you know that is not making me no money
I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money
I can't hang with all my homies cause they handouts
Asking for some money

Niggas be asking for money they thinking its funny, I don’t give them nothing
You niggas ain't bucking and no I ain't fronting
You thinking its sweet banana clip for monkeys
Its 2015 and my double cup muddy
You laughing right now but don’t think shit won’t get ugly
Turn em into bread and peel back his muffin
You finger fuck light but that give him no budget
I’m smoking on cookie the cookie jar musty
Treat the blunt like teddy bears and I stuff it
You turn to a cop when you get guap and cuff it
Bitches police nowadays they gone buss it
Back and again all about Benjamins
I’m a human being forgive me if I sin
I done been broke before I ain’t going back no more
I done came this far to fall off the pedestal
I done took a walk and walk up to Texaco
Talk to Chico finessing him for Regano
You boys so crazy you can not cop a whole one you no friend or foe
The monts in my pocket sloppy joe
Christian Louboutin Spikes on my tippy toes
Break a ball like my name is Chris Jerico
Chop off the top like I’m Eddie Guerrero
My niggas they ride around selling marshmallows
Nowadays niggas call me marshall lynch the way I got the Seahawks flying from Seattle
Stuck in the atlanta ocean canoe but got no pad to paddle
Stay away from the snakes and you can hear them come by the way that they rattle

When I woke up this morning
I told myself I had to get some money
I can not hang with you jabronis
Cause you know that is not making me no money
I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money
I can't hang with all my homies cause they handouts
Asking for some money

Spanish lil' mama she call me senor
Vámonos andele she want some more
Fifty bad bitches on my yacht all aboard

Said she want to takeoff and come with me right around my city
We got our feet up sipping margaritas big plate of linguine
She a bad girl like riri but a house wife like Nini
My diamonds is looking like water, vvs is looking like ecstasy
She down to make a porno follow if you take a photo
You could've been at the mansion but I hit that in the condo
She screaming YRN, man that's nothin' but Migos promo
Migos chain three amigos you know that's the Migos logo

Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy, rest in peace, Whitney
Pardon me but I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch? Stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady, fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick, stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me?

All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho

Women with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

I don't want no mediocre that mean I don't want no local
We can go shop at Rodeo while you bounce on me like pogo
Take trips to Barbados where we can dip off and lay low
Have a convo about peso, stick together like lego
I feeling her tip she giving me mental
I'm beatin' it up no instrumental
She popping it on me like a pimple
I'm trapping the birds she like a criminal
You know we splurge she gave me the word, I bought her a Birkin
She wanted a Bentley not a Suburban
I came here from Africa mama from Persia
She bad making me nervous

Right hand in the air, I solemnly swear
I never go down if she don’t do her hair, no more
You won’t get no kiss if it’s a bush down there

Run from on the north, take a hoe and make a million
Make a basic bitch feel like Hillary Clinton
Let's talk about the rapper swagger jagger niggas
Put the powder on my hand so I can smack a nigga
I had powder on my hand before the rapping nigga
On the north turned the bando to a mansion nigga
Million dollar cash in the duffel
Million dollar man got muscle
It's a whole pound in the plastic
Gotta' pay for fore' you snatch it
Grandmama died, momma cried a million times
Pistol Pete died, still cried a million times
Life paid off all these hard ass years
Money don't change, but the money change bills


Life was so hard I prayed to God
Shit went good everyday nigga I had it hard
Quit sprinting out the crib running from tear drops to the cars
I have been through the jungle and forest, came out with no scar
Remember the day at momma house sleep
Quavo woke me up in my sleep
Had one Jordan on his feet
We tripping, looking out for the police
He said not only did I lose my shoe, lost my ID
Take you back about a year ago, trapping it at the bando
Way before niggas begin using the Migos flow
When my pockets was hurting I had to kick a door
Or found a way to get benjamins was the motto
I go to sleep, I was dreaming about hitting the lotto
Wake up in reality, he gotta get every dollar
You told me to give it up, but watch how you gone' follow
Niggas that talking they gone' holla
Brush the dirt off my collar
Get back to the guala
We came in as young rich niggas
Ain't no pray to nobody only my savior
I don't fuck with none of you niggas cuz' you fugazy
Life's hard life is whatever you make it

They ain’t wanna see a nigga in
We independent and we countin' Benjamins
The rap game got no friends
Nigga fight, nigga pretend
Nigga act like yo man
Nigga won’t even give you a hand
Nigga talk behind yo back
Won’t happen if you ain’t got a sack
This a true story real facts
Make the whole world roger that

Hunned bands, watch them fat

In the rap game I sit back

All the hoes wasn't fuckin' with me back then
But all the bitches wanna fuck Young Guapo now
Ten promoters at my fuckin back end
Got a pint of lean whenever Guapo fly in town
Motherfuck the rap game and industry
The streets they taught me never show no sympathy
I swear I never thought I’d be on MTV
Them M&Ms the only thing that interest me
I know why they envy me


Back then they wasn't fuckin' with me
Now they can’t get enough of me
Now the cameras out and they flashin'
Paparazzi takin' pictures
Young independent niggas ballin like the major league
I think they done caught a disease
I’m allergic to brokanese
Young nigga came from the bottom
To the top I had to grind
I was on the block fore the sunrise
So a young nigga like me had to shine
Came a long way from bustin' bands and servin' Ziploc
Solid foundation, QC the label
We hangin' above the label

All I wanna do is go run to the money
Run to the money while the money keep coming

Whippin' up a brick and we smokin' out an onion
Bankroll stupid, left wrist Franck Muller
TRU Religion jeans make her think that I'm buddha
Bad bitch with me and she come from Cuba

Little bitty bitch she walkin' up look at her body
The work I divide it
Acrobatic nigga take the brick and circumcise it
Trappin' out the house the window boarded up with timber!

I am the master I'm Mr.Miyagi
I'm in the kitchen whippin' chemicals
My nigga's criminals wanna get physical
You walk around with your pockets on minimal
Remix a brick and make it look identical
Overseas chopper intercontinental
Trap out the bando before you serve look out the peep-hole
The people be watching for kilos
I'm with the vato's que pasa to all my amigo's
I'm trappin' I feel like I'm Nino
Nigga just call me Dorito

Ten key's on the yacht boat shoot freethrow

Offset
Detective looking for me asking bout me
In the city plugged in like a socket
I don't know what the fuck these nigga's talkin' bout?
Sat me down asked me you gonna talk or not
No arguing, fussin', discussion
And the Mulsanne parked in the driveway
Nobody thought I would be back here in it
When I pull up I'm lookin in dey face
I thank the lord because I'm eatin' say my grace
Back in the Bando whippin' particles
And you can catch me in magazine articles
Balenciaga nigga dressing remarkable
In the game permanently not erasable

Welcome to Migo world, living out the trap

Seventeen years old cash out on a jugg

Eighteen years old me and RelMoney hit the plug for a boat

They call us young rich niggas, for a reason
They told me leave the bando, it ain't that easy
Hot boy, but my jewelry out the freezer
They try to take us from the streets, the streets they need us

They bust my trap one more time, moving my trap to Geneva
Face card A1 no steak sauce, no passport need no Visa
We fuck up Neiman Marcus, we spend a stack on sneakers
Shoot him in his face, he gonna' wish that he had Jesus

They looking at me cause' they never seen money
Pull up in a Beamer with a onion
All Benjamins, blue hundreds
Came off the porch, I was wrapping mummies
Al Capone, meet the Tommy
Safe house, cross the country
Bugs Bunny got the bando jumping
Straight out the jungle, Giuseppe Jumanji

Hop out the whip and I'm dressed in the latest
I'm talking numbers, I ain't here for conversation
Put some ice on my neck and put some ice on my Bezel
Hop out the whip with the mask like I'm Jason
I walk where I want with that strap on my hip
I got the molly sack I'm good when I dip
I serve you some gas, call that a QuikTrip
Hit a bag for a show nigga, that's a quick flip

Tray 1 got a bankroll
I'm cooking up crack rock casserole
I got your unc in the finger fold
He went from hustling to smoking blow
Now that shit be a damn shame
I got a hit, blame it on cocaine
Cocaine classic, coming out the wrapper
I swear to god Tray1 ain't just rapping

Young nigga go get him
Fuck the club up, fuck everybody with him
Too many bullets, can't miss him
I got a extra 30 shots in my Balmain denims
Whole team got racks
We a solid foundation, we just leave you with the sacks
Your Backwoods ain't fat
And that's a cut pint, nigga that's a motherfucking fact

Migo JerZ
And I'm still on the curb
I'ma jugg his ass if you give me the word
Take poured up so my words real slurred
If you want a point five then you ain't getting served
YRN on my neck for life
North side OG, been earned my stripes
Fuck with the Migos, you gon' pay the price
I'm in the trap with a Backwood, shooting dice

Pop the 4, Trey got that shit out the liter
Sippin on lean but I'm cooking the reefer
Young nigga I got more stripes than Adidas
Smile like a cheetah
Running 10k for a visa
Fuck her and leave her
I'm a rich nigga, I pull up in creature
Young nigga ball like a preacher

Migo, Lingo
Young nigga stay with the strap
Fuck up my check, I'ma get it right back
My niggas are crazy and that is a fact
Bitches want to hate because of the fame
I never would trust them because they the same
Creeping through the night like Bruce Wayne
My money in my pocket gon' stay the same

Skippa da Flippa's the killer
The trap always gone' need me, I'm the best dealer
Arch your back lil more, now I bet you gone' feel 'er
Dab on a nigga ho in a chinchilla
Old school McGrady, I stay with the Rocket
I got the cannon, make you pop, lock, and drop it
You talk about blue hundreds, that is my topic
You sipping Karo, need to stop it

They call us young rich niggas, for a reason
They told me leave the bando, it ain't that easy
Hot boy, but my jewelry out the freezer
They try to take us away from the streets, the streets they need us

We crossed over then we slam dunk

You know that we number 1 ain’t no opponent
Dirk Nowitzki make a nigga fall back
I gave you the pack and you don't get it back
I'm dunkin', I'm dumping
You hide in the bushes you runnin'

Crossover the plug like I'm Chris Paul
And I ball hard pass her to my dawg

Play with the migo we kidnap your daughter


MIGO!
QUAVO!
Slam dunk and brick like deandre
3000 pound like I'm andre
Pull up on you, you in LA
If your not talking money for, what you say
Hit a nigga with the throwaway
When I step out bed I hop out with K's
I catch a nigga postin' in the city
When I throw the alley, ooh they gonna get it
Your is bitch too friendly, I know she with it
When I pull up on her put it in her kitty
Played that bit like I was Steve Nash
Since a young nigga I was chasing cash
Prescription lean came from Dr Phil
Hit a nigga in a crowd, Jermaine O'neal

Rolling up extension could somebody pass me a lighter, Got falcons like Roddy no piper
I drop the top now I like her
Got lil' goons where they gon' stirk ya
Got too bad bitches they diking
I take my chain off, put it in the crowd, lil' mamas start fighting
Pull up and the line is frightening
I smash these hoes no wife-ing them
Beat the pots and the pans like Ike and them
Hit these niggas like Tyson did
Pull up in the dark, no light with him
Try to copy my swag, thats plagiarism
I know snakes with a lot of venom
Call CDC for the anti-venom

All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is count up checks, checks, checks
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is count up checks, checks, checks
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is count up checks, checks, checks

Man I swear this bitch so cray
She cray, she talkin' bout having my babies

Too cray


Cookin' and flippin' and whippin'
She callin' my phone the moment you trippin'
I'm in the middle of the kitchen ______________________ I drop in the trenches
But them chicken they bought you, them Jimmy Choos now you all around taking Instagram pictures
I know that the Feds they watchin, like Nikki Buns up in Harlem
Give it up, fuck nigga, it's a robbery
Got some niggas in the hood that are robbin' for me
Migos we the new Outkast and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony





Your average trapper might be as rich as your favorite rapper
Flexing in front of the camera
Balling like he got the stamina
Really he don't even amount to nothin'
What is your worth?
Boy you a turd
Real trappers on the curb
Real trappers like to serve
You want that life that he deserve
Dope boys buy a car and they owning
Rap niggas get the car and they renting
I know some trappers that worth about fifty
I know some trappers that's living like Diddy
I know some trappers that took more shots than 50
Shout out to my nigga 50
And I know some rappers that's still penny penching, still trynna' get a digit
I'm a real rapper nigga, check my bank account, I bet you see a milli
I'm a real rapper nigga, shout out to the trappers trapping in the city
Trappers slash rapper nigga, might catch a nigga trapping out a Bentley
You a trapper slash actor nigga, you would take a Oscar or an Emmy
Free my nigga Offset, all my niggas thugging ain't no pretending
When I was out trapping, you working at Wendy's
I got a pint of some drink and on Denny's
When I trap a brick, you might think I'm at Benny's
I keep a rack on me like I play tennis
Play with the weight like I'm at LA Fitness
Trapper slash rapper I handle my business
Pull out the chopper boy go mind your business
I pop a perc and then come to my senses
Add the shit out and I don't leave a witness
Shout out to trappers that trapping at Whitney
Migo the gang brung the north to the city
Met with some trappers that's running the city
Made an empire, QC we submitting
Started from nothing, and now we worth millions
If you a real trapper, I know that you feel this
At the table with the plug like the Indians and Pilgrims
My niggas don't give no fuck 'bout your feelings
I know some trappers, got M's in the ceiling

Blood, shed and tears on the north

No niggas real on the north
R.I.P Pistol P died on the north

Then ran out the ticket
Then brought that shit back to the north

I fell asleep in the bando then I woke up in the mansion
Still trapping out the house I'm selling Marilyn Manson
Still wrapping the plastics, Money stretching elastic
Mama told me when I grow up boy don't be like your Daddy

Finessing the plug with magic

Seeing Grandma in the casket

Imma continue the dabbin'

You gon continue the actin'
Remember the days finessing the plug and runnin' the plays like madden

Pull up in zone 6 droptop M6
Straight out the bando cookin' up big bricks
Bust it down in the trap sellin' fish sticks

Jump in the water swim where the sharks at
Too many bricks plug our contact
Stash house I put the work in the carpet
Stash spot got a secret compartment
SK hunnid round in my cartridge
Plug in Canada got a cookie garden
My lawyer Michael Jordan he beat the charges
You are our decoys in the charger
Sell you a Brett Farve or a Tony Parker
Sellin Lieutenant Dan I’m the Sargent

I fell asleep in the bando then I woke up in the mansion
From a nic to a brick I made a million dollars trappin'

Bad bitches nigga

You know what I'm saying living luxury nigga

I bought a Bentley Mulsanne
And I sat it on forgis
Woke up in the morning
Look to my left damn dat bitch gorgeous
Back then when I couldn't wear them Louboutins
I used to wear Jordans
The M-15 I'm grippin', my mansion, Mona Lisa portrait
If you drank too much phizzurp, won't wake up till the morning
Old bricks they rep them blocks I'm talkin' Alonzo Mourning
I might touchdown on a pussy nigga when I'm perfomin'
A show in Paris, Amsterdam, and Belgium they think we was tourin'
Don't need no pistol or no gat when I'm in the booth recordin'
I'm Slick Rick in my streets, I'm tellin' the children them stories
Used to ride Honda Accord now 911 my Porsche
QC the label we the new Death Row my niggas come join
Before that rollie was that Jacobs
Cause I couldn't afford it
I'm just keeping it 100
Niggas lie in their stories
Kim Kardashian bitches beautiful
Diamonds is african
Shippin' and dabbin'
Look like a mannequin
Bitches panicking

I love money I'm passionate
Club packed to capacity
I'm sippin' lean like a daiquiri
Got the 40 I'm packing it
Your bitch is an animal
Eat the dick like a carnivore
And I pull up Aventador
I'm fuckin' her you kissed the whore
You got money gotta feed the poor
They watching the Migos it's season four
I cannot believe that got me a Jeep and a Porsche
Your bitch in the kitchen she sucking my dick and she tellin' me her knees are sore
I was 15 I jumped out the Porsche
23 got a mansion golf course
Bugatti's, Ferrari smoking exotic while I'm ridin'
I'm molly exotic
My young niggas catchin' bodies
I didn't had no priority
Now I got me a property
I'm just making it obvious
You hated me previous
You lovin' the millions
My bitch ain't a citizen Brazilian an immigrant
I love both of my children cause I know god sent them
Kill a nigga planting...



I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap
I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap

Quavo
When I do a show I get back to the trap
I might do a show and almost stay with the strap
The plug got the pack, I gotta go snatch it
Then I fuck on that nat-nat, I love my hoe ratchet
Look at my wrist fantastic
Doing the magic like I play basket
I drop it off with accuracy, I go pick it up at Aspen
My niggas down the road stabbing
And Skippa Da Flippa, we having
Papparazis still flashin', police harassing, when I ride past 'em
Trap niggas know what's happenin'
Came into Atlanta from Athens
You niggas drinking molasses
You think that it's Ac and I'm laughing
My plug he Asian like Enter the Dragon
I bought a beamer and paint it black satin
Most of you niggas be rapping, really be acting, god damn it's tragic

I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap
I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap



Two cups, two cups, two cups
Two cups, two cups, two cups

The color car I drive I pop dat color {​​​​​​​​​​​???}​​​​​​​​​​​
I get fucked up like Jimi Hendrix, but wit no guitar, I bought my own lot so there's no garage



No dirty sprite but dis dat Dirty Fanta
Black nigga, white ice, just call me Panda,  slippin on yo pimpin' walkin' on Bananas
Gotcha bitch watching me out my favorite channel, Get his bitch kick ha' out just call her Panna, Sippin' lean throwing money up in platinum
Sippin' lean out the styrofoam, Two foreign bitches rub me like a Saxophone
And the ice filled all way to the top, sippin' on pure codeine straight drop

Yeah, Migos, Rocky!
Say you wanna be somebody, right?
Feel like Rocky Balboa

You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Gone!
Now a nigga on top of your ho
Rock Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa

Run to the top of the stairs in Philly
I'm feeling like Quavo, Meek Millie
It's level to this shit in my city
The dub, the 100 the 50
Young nigga back then drinking midgets, I did it
Remember that nigga Orlando, Finessed him with Oregano
Rabbit food, Blues clues
Snooze you lose, That's the game fool
Remember when he was on top
In high school, I remember that
Then reality hit and I rolled up with them with my Audi coupe


Rocky Balboa, Itallian Stallion
Cruising in my McLaren
Pulling up, Rocky Balboa, my dial, my diamonds are VVSS's
Used to be a underdog, now I'm a big dog
Trapping got gas in the mansion
Take a nigga bitch, Switch-A-Roo the click
Party, Party, Party like Marilyn Manson
PeeWee Longway, I made the name
I changed the game, put dope in her pampers
Give me her address and don't tell her name
This is my life get a clear understanding
Fresh out the banana boat with the dope
Bitch be treating me like I'm the pope
Fly as a bitch form the A, the left coast
Kicking bitch shit I'm Sosa with the loafs
Long way!


What did you wanna be when you were growing up
A basketball player, a football player or even a rapper?
Some niggas they wanted to be on the block
They dreamed to be trapping
Trapping the nigga out like I'm a Capo, or maybe an Alpha
Cooking dope but I'm no chemist
Adrian all in my kitchen
Molly  you looking like danger
Bob and weave, then hit the canvas
Where's the food in my fryer, or it connected with the banana's
I feel like Kanye, all of these cameras
Just to hit a Jug in the Camry!





Big bankroll on fold
Trappin' out the top of condo
Cause you see the niggas skeezin'
Had to move my money outta England
England, England
Pounds, pounds on me like the king of England
England, England
Pounds, pounds on me like the king of England

Quavo, Quavo, Quavo
Pull up and I got the pounds
King of England, diamonds under my pinky
Fuck is you thinkin'?!
My niggas, they keep the extension
Car's not rented
Young nigga, I cash out on Bentleys
Get to the door, the 50s the 100
I'm watchin' you scraping up pennies
In Venus, yo bitch, she suckin' my penis
You a fuck nigga and I mean it
Got pounds, king of England


King of England, you niggas rookies
I am a veteran, smokin' on clickers
Yo bitch, she textin', my bitch the queen of England
Elizabith II, my nigga, we're droppin' the pound
The Nino Brown, and he got arrested
I'm laughing at niggas, Chris Rock
I walk around on the block
I'm whippin' that dope, no miracle
Hop out that limo, pull out the red carpet
Like 80 Coming To America
Plottin' on me is hysterical


El Chapo Jr
I got pounds, pull up in yo town, choppa hundred rounds
Goin' down, betta ask around
Bitch, I'm makin' it happen
Got pictures outta the condo
Foolie the Prince, makin' a call to my Migos
He pullin' up pronto
Bitches they paying my rent
Migo west 700
Taking a trip and we landing in England
Bitches they black and white, lookin' like penguins
Trappin' alound in London, trappin' on more in London
Niggas, they skeezin' we beef for no reason
I throw a skimask when we ain't even skiing
West coast, nigga




Watchin' my pinky like 200k
Gettin' cooler and cooler get put in your face
My watch was 100 but you get it cheaper
Bought an all black lambo called jeeper creepers, inside it's white its like cottage
We got the bags to move it

No they can't sleep on me





We wrappin' em up, mummies
I got a uzi tucked
Flame a nigga for snitching
Flame the nigga for runnin'
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Flame a nigga for runnin'
Flame the nigga for flexing
For talking shit to these bitches
Flame the nigga for flexing

We wrappin' em up, mummies
I got a uzi tucked
Flame a nigga for snitching
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Flame a nigga for snitching

It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open

Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open

Wet just like an ocean, she gon' let me slide on it
Forgiato tires, I'mma let you ride on it
Tambourine with that ass, she gon' shake that ass on me
Feel like Juvenile, baby, back that ass on me
Pocket full of cheese, yeah, sloppy macaroni
I fucked her on a Tuesday, shout out Makonnen
Performin' on stage, no safety on the pistol
Lil' mama whispering niggas plottin' in the V.I.P
Pulled out, I gave her a hunnid just to tip her
Gotta know she real bad, I leave the club, I miss her
Bounce that ass ho, boing boing, pogo
Throw the profit on lil mama, cuz she make me more
She a trap girl she like blue strip hundos
She no fuckin' with if you broke oh no, no, no, no
Bounce that ass like a trampoline
Throw the money in the air like it got wings


Work, twerk, go berzerk in your vert
Skurt, skurt, pop it nasty in that mini skirt
Mr. Perfect, she perfect, I call her Mrs. Perfect
My neck lookin' like Mr. T, my hands is lookin' like James Worthy
Pop it, pop it, I gon' throw out the guala
Don't make it rain I make it thunder
I'm slappin' ass like E. Honda
My diamonds look like Willy Wonka
She got that body from her momma
She strippin and fuckin' the owner
She poppin', I'm throwin' some commas
She droppin' it just like it's hydraulics




I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it

I'm goin' through it, man this shit so crazy
'07, lost my brother, 15 years in them cages
Now my grandma rest in peace, that was my first lady
Thousand dollar specs on my face to block the haters
Goin' through it right now but still chasin' the paper
My bitch fucked the whole team, I never should have saved her
And now I'm goin' crazy, cause I'm just goin' through it
I still walk around with Rugers cause I like to shoot 'em
I thought I loved that bitch to the mothafuckin' core
I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got me in a Porsche
Money, money, money, money got my fingers sore
I'm rollin' up a 3-5 blunt look like a core
Feds watchin' me, still servin' J's, I'm paranoid


I'm goin' through it, my niggas in the slammer
I had to go to Wal-Mart and collect some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin' nothing but tickets
Do numbers water whippin', Young Quavo, yeah I did it
My bitch, she smashed the whole team, damn that ho too friendly
So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, ain't leavin' my wealth to none of these bitches
Cause once you dead and gone, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Water whippin', show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley


I've been goin' through it, shit been crazy
2000, lost my cousin, cried like a baby
My ancestors been goin' through it, back then in slavery
Now the time faster, I am the master
Could've been me back then, nigga woulda been like "Fuck your master"
My name Takeoff, I am NASA
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, pop a zan like she pop a gun
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond

I'm goin' through it
2000, lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Made
Just lost my grandmomma
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Done took so many losses, it's only right that we win

Momma told the nigga no
We really live by the code
Heavy choppers on the road

Look at my wrist and it's frozen
Look at my neck and it's golden

No you can't, no you can't
You don't sip that lean by the pint
You a peon, you don't got rank
Call the plug up, get a pound of stank
Quavo Stuntin, name hold weight
In the kitchen and I make a earthquake
When you walk around, pocket full of cake
Gotta keep your grass low, full of snakes
Chevrolet SS on skates
Got a white girl, her name Kate
Got a Chinese girl named Ling
Got a rocket on my hip, Yao Ming
Get money in my dreams
In the hood, they call me king
In the Ville or the Upper 100 wings
Can't walk cause I'm sippin' on lean
Got a 9, call me Luol Deng
Don't never let the money make me
Grow up to be what I wanna be
Don't ever let a nigga make me

Two cup, Styrofoam, filled up with maple
Pull up to the front of the club like I'm disabled
Two bitches in the kitchen cooking Vanilla Wafers
The Lamb outside, young nigga, yeah I own it
Don't like the mid around me, I don't condone it
Gucci aviators on my face to catch the focus
My bitch is not local, two bands around her shoulder
I don't need a deal little nigga I thought I told you
Pull up in a Lotus, to catch the haters focus

I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label

I don't need no label, I don't need no label
No Cash Money, No Limit
My money no limit
Riding in the Bentley, with the windows tinted
Foreign bitch is sucking, got to know they fucking
Rolling of a molly, rolling off a Xan
Calling up the plug for them stupid drugs
In the kitchen with them stainless steel like a chef
I don't need no label nigga I sign my damn self
I got loud, Xan, molly, and I got that meth
Pull up in Rari, Audi
The VVS's on my neck and rockin'
Been plugged in with the Haitian's
Stacking all my cash, Grants, Jacksons, and the Franklins

I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label




Yeah
Oh shit man, who that is?
Shout out Migos, shout out Zaytoven one time
That Migos, Drake on Versace?

Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing ‘cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm selling a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talking 'bout? Saw this shit coming like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like, "What the fuck is he plannin'?"
Just make sure that you got a backup plan ‘cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is coming, September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like, "Damn, I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speaking in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelings ‘cause business is business, it's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York, ‘cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are calling me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

Versace, Versace, I brought that shit back, all these niggas they copy
Medusa head on me, I'm at the hotel, Versace Palazzo
I rented the yacht for a week, but I bought the convertible Lambo
Six mill for the mansion, I see haters coming, I need some more ammo
These niggas gay, that's Elmo, so much green I turned camo
Some Hoover niggas on flannels, light, light you up, no candle
Grip on that handle, Yosemite Sam ya, that bitch bang like a banjo
Versace, Versace, my brother King Trell, he in a Ferrari
Paul Pierce is my neighbor, I told him he shoulda went to the Clippers
I got some crazy ideas for Versace, get them and tell 'em my number
Versace, auggh Picasso, Basquiat, I'm cocky
23, fifteen mill, I'm just getting started
Pop water my water, I walk around on my wallet
I don't fuck with Saddam but, that's gold all in my toilet
Statues of Horus, Anubis is polished
I don't gotta rap about, coke for you to enjoy it
I'm 'bout to join the money team, just holla to Floyd about it

These suckers be hating, they praying to God I don't cop a Bugatti
Hold up, drop the top on the 'Rari
Pull in the club and I'm stopping the party
Hold up, got bitches on bitches, they popping on Mollys
I'm probably at Follies with PeeWee and Tip, questing with Lou
I did everything that I said I would do
I really won't tell you I'm better than you
But we are not on the same level as you
‘Cause the G55 got a hell of a view
Regular niggas make regular moves
With ya regular bitch and ya regular crew
And you nigga still smoking on regular too, like "Word!?"
What a shame, my nigga
Louboutin blood like Game, my nigga
Get left tryna aim, my nigga
Like Saddam Hussein, my nigga
I'm whipping this brand new machine, hundred bands in my jeans
Call yo bitch Barry Sanders, she done ran through the team
I got hoes out the D, they playing on the team
Do anything for me, I mix that Xan' with the lean
Hold up, let me get it back
I bought the boardwalk and I parked on the ave, shit my life like Monopoly
You caught a new case and you got outta jail but you look like a cop to me
Get out of jail free card?



Don't act like you don't know I got them racks bitch
Don't act like you don't know I got them packs bitch
Don't act like you don't know I'm wildin' out biiitch
Don't act like you don't know that's who I am bitch
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
No Homer Simpson but you know I keep that dough
All white diamonds look just like a line a coke
Like Rozay, Quavo get it off the boat
Smoking loud ass gas, make a nigga choke
And I know you smoking mid, I see that barrel smoke
Take your bitch to the mall, she walking out with Coach
Now I got her running plays like I am the coach
Hang them on a rope, soldiers trained to go
All my niggas don't move till I say so
Niggas trapping out a mansion and a Lambo
Can't see the troops cause they wearing camo
Don't act like you don't know
2 cups drink a lil' bit mo'
No Shawty L-o
Bricks like Soulja, man they always on gold
When you see the squad better act like you know
In the kitchen with the stove
Got the hood saying 'Jumping out the bando'
Niggas mad acting like they don't know
Bill G put terror in your squad
And I walk around pockets on Fat Joe
Walk around with the deuce deuce
Smoking on fat ass blunts Bruce Bruce
Riding in the truck with no motherf*cking roof
And it got 2 doors would've thought it was a coupe
Hit the gas in my
Hit hard like a nigga smoking Kimbo
And when I sip the lean, lean low like a nigga playing limbo
Pull up in a drop top lambo
All the kids they scream out 'Bingo'
That bitch who I could afford her
New world order

I done been posted up on the block
I done been running from the cops
Got the dope, all up in my sock
And the J's always wanna knock
When they come knocking at my door
Bout 3 or 4 o'clock in the morn'
They be asking, they be itching for the dope
They be asking, they be asking for my coke
Wanna pop a bean, wanna smoke?
Nigga tell me what you'd do for the dope
Kick doors, rob a store, and a nigga gonna give him point four
I pull out, Maserati, smelling like that kush cologne
Waiting on big bruh to come home, counting up checks while I'm getting dome
Sipping on lean, out the Styrofoam
Got an extendo filled up with strong
I just fucked up a check, I'm about to get it back
Bout to bounce back like ping-pong

Fuck check up get it right back
My niggas don't know how to act
And I still got bricks like Shaq
Went to sleep today off the Act
Gassed up but I ain't got cataracts
In the strip club fuck a pussy stat
Hit the block then I fuck up them bags
Hit the lot, drop a sac on a Jag
Then drop another sac for the stash
I don't want to talk 'less it's 'bout cash
Got a foreign bitch and she love to pop Xan's
Drop a sac, put it in the trash can
Good pack smelling like the trash can
These 12 be looking for the work
Disappear I clear my hands
Then I pull of in a Range Rover
Trying to sack up with my nigga Sosa
No triple-A, yeah the game over
I know niggas that bite like a Cobra
Wrap the pack up, ship it overseas
I got anything a nigga need
Them Xan's, or that lean, that kush pack with no seeds

Feelin like John ghotti , bricks in da rari
All my niggas killas, bringing pistols in da party
I'm kickin it with the vato ,  trapping and wrapping the kilo
Kickin it with the migo, countin up the pesos
Sippin on lean I'm losing my mind , The Lord is giving me plenty of signs
Since a young nigga I'm watching my brother
I'm walkin around and now I got the nine
I don't love the pussy , you niggas is rookie , I'm smokin on cookie my pockets on snookie
Pull up in jags and rovers its over I'm ballin like Lamar odom

Real trap niggas get money ,pick up the phone whenever it's money
Sellin dem bricks they dummy
Wrapping that work like a mummy
The birds, you know that they humming , them hollow tips bust and u runnin
Sellin that coco nocolo , the plug it b costa Nostra

We the ones dodgin the FBI , we the ones drop in the 4
Mix it with water then heat it up , whip it around with the fork
Mix it around wit the coke , meet me up rite at the store
Top of the line , creme of the crop, hit it and murda she wrote
Got that pistol tucked in my Gucci belt , work with the water like micheal phelps
Give me the doe need nothing else , fuck signin deals ill sign myself
I'm real mob tied , real boss hog , really let u have it , shit ill num your jaw
I got my migos comin cross the border, grocery bag full of arm and hammer baking soda
Me n my migos get that work in , have your whole block sowed for you count to 10
Wats up quavo. Wats up takeoff. Wats up offset . Man dis for the projects
Dis for the gangsta s, dis for the hustlas , the costa Nostra dawg they can't touch us
They can't see me , they can't b me , the Feds watch me dawg like ima tv
Cd stay on repeat, creep through with that street sweep , stay round where da gs be
Kilo go for 33

Nigga don't make me mad
That's why I had to put extensions in all of my mags
All of my life young nigga would get into something
Young nigga came up off of nothing
Now I got to learn the different lingo taking private jets across the country
You niggas still waiting on your momma
Somebody shine the lights upon them

Young nigga trapping bags
On the block with Cam running from the fucking tag
Robbing the goon old man
Hop in the jag, young nigga hit the dash
One thing about the migo line nigga know we living fast
Whole lot of cash, OG cash bag in the Jag ain't gotta dash

Money bags whole slab!

Me and 12 engines in the rear now
Always doubted me, but tell 'em that we here now
No negativity, focused on my career now
Race game I'm Dwayne with the smack down
He can go pound for pound better ask how

One more ride, one more race
I'mma go off
Yah, I gotta go now

Scotty en el molly, cohete de bolsillo de O'Reilly
Perras cruzan la frontera, nigga, perras de los trópicos
Nigga joven con la Anna, caminando con el martillo
Hablando de la gramática del país, nigga



Mamá te dijo
Mamá me dijo que no vendiera el trabajo
Mamá te dijo

1995, 2005
El cupé del espacio, Quavo Yoda, pourin 'bebió en refrescos

Me levanto por mi cuenta, señor, oí que vas a clonar, señor
Detener todo ese flexin ', nigga joven no quiere ir allí
Nunca he sido un gopher, pero siempre he sido un soldado
Niggas jóvenes en el corte, publicado como un buitre
Divin 'fuera del escenario en la multitud, es un mosh pit
Sí, shawty mal, pero ella rompió porque ella no posee mierda
Mamá me preguntó, "Hijo, cuando el trappin 'gon' dejar?"
He estado rondando por la ciudad en mi nueva perra



Mamá te lo dijo, mamá te lo dijo








Since when I ain't get no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?
Since when I ain't count no stacks? Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when I ain't fuck your ass? Since when you ain't suck me up?
Since when I ain't hit the club? Since when I ain't throw the cash up?
Since when? Since when? Since when? You lyin'
Since when? Since when? Since when? Are you lyin'?
Since when I ain't ball on hard? Since when I ain't sell no rock?
Since when I ain't count no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?

Since when? Turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up, since when?
Since '91, I was gettin' it in
Countin' nothin' but them Benjamins
'09 in True Religion
You decided to do it in 2010
I decided to move it to Robin
You couldn't buy it, your pockets was hurtin'
I mothafuckin' do it
Walk up in the club rockin' nothin' but Louis
Y'all niggas flexin' 'bout the shit that you did
My nigga, we been, kickin', pimpin'
Codeine when we sippin'
250 for the lenses
CL drop, Benzes
Just went to the doctor yesterday
Told me chill on the lean for my kidneys
Laughed at him, said "You is silly"
Two bitches in the kitchen, water whippin'
But it ain't no forensics
Niggas try to rob me, I wouldn't risk it

Since when I ain't get no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?
Since when I ain't count no stacks? Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when I ain't fuck your ass? Since when you ain't suck me up?
Since when I ain't hit the club? Since when I ain't throw the cash up?
Since when? Since when? Since when? You lyin'
Since when? Since when? Since when? Are you lyin'?
Since when I ain't ball on hard? Since when I ain't sell no rock?
Since when I ain't count no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?

Since when I ain't kill you with the Louis?
Since when I ain't kill you with the mothafuckin' Gucci?
Since when I ain't kill you with the mothafuckin' Truey?
Since when a young nigga like me didn't do it?
Since when a young nigga didn't flex?
Since when a young nigga didn't count no checks?
Since when a young nigga didn't hit the mall?
Since when a young nigga didn't buy a couple bangs?
Since when I ain't pull up in a Jag?
Since when I ain't pull up in a Benz
Since when I ain't fuck no foreign bitch
Then I fuck her twin
Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when a nigga lighted up mid?
Since when I pour a 4 in my 20 ounce my shit just fizz
Since when you see me in the club with designers on my lid
Back then, I've been doin' it since when when a nigga was a lil damn kid
It's in my blood, it's my skin
Ain't nothin' out here I ain't did
Robbin and sellin' pills

Since when I ain't get no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?
Since when I ain't count no stacks? Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when I ain't fuck your ass? Since when you ain't suck me up?
Since when I ain't hit the club? Since when I ain't throw the cash up?
Since when? Since when? Since when? You lyin'
Since when? Since when? Since when? Are you lyin'?
Since when I ain't ball on hard? Since when I ain't sell no rock?
Since when I ain't count no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?

Since when a young nigga ain't do it?
Since when my pants wasn't Truey?
Since when, might pull up with the Louis, and I'm pullin' up with the Gucci
Since when I pull up with that foreign coupe, look like I'm in a movie
Since when I ain't take your ho? Since when I ain't make her my ho?
Since when I ain't put her in the trap? Countin' cheese in the bando
Since when my VV don't shine? Since when my bitch wasn't fine?
Since when I put her on the block and she make a 9 to a muthafuckin dime

Since when I ain't get no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?
Since when I ain't count no stacks? Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when I ain't fuck your ass? Since when you ain't suck me up?
Since when I ain't hit the club? Since when I ain't throw the cash up?
Since when? Since when? Since when? You lyin'
Since when? Since when? Since when? Are you lyin'?
Since when I ain't ball on hard? Since when I ain't sell no rock?
Since when I ain't count no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?



Born with it
Go and get it

Fuckin' with the wrong one, trippin'
Hundred round drum, listen
Get 'em knocked off for a ticket
Have my young nigga do the sentence
Aw man, whip up the white, Wendy
Rockstar livin' life, Lenny
You can do better, never settle
I tell the plug mail 'em
Which way? Dat way, tell 'em, ayy

Man it's Gucci Mane the Goat
And I'm at these rappers throats
I'm like Scarface on a banana boat, I'm tryna keep afloat
Yeah it's Wop the Guwopster
I live like a mobster
Eat shrimp and lobster
I flew in with a chopper
Breaking bread that's my breakfast
Two bitches I'm so selfish
I wanna cut her off
Her head too good it got me helpless
Ya should feel embarrassed
I just touched down in Paris
My homie said he single but his side-bitches are married
Save some for the drama though
Guess I'm still the DJ
So I'm throwing cash and repay
Flush it on the freeway
Countin' cash for three days and all my pussy's prepaid



If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof


We throwing out the money out the roof like ceiling ain’t got no top
We throwing money out the roof migos got that guap
We Pouring up that 4 that double cup that Kevin
I’m a nigga that skateboard grind that kick flip money Tony Hawk
Loud pack taste so ? my bitch kick back yo bitch ugly
We pull up in the club sippin’ color purple like ?
Blue chevy like took it pockets on snooki
People takin them pictures they watching like movies

If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof


If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that M I D
If yo ass ain’t fat baby I can’t talk to you
If the grams don’t weigh out right then I can’t fuck with you
If that pack ain’t smelling right i can’t shop with you
If it ain’t 50 or more a show then I can’t do a show for you
If I ain’t fuckin’ bad hoes its a sin, if I ain’t rocking designer clothes its a sin
Free my niggas in the pen, bless my niggas in the pen
I know one day when they get out they say they say they never do this again
But how they hell we gone eat, how they hell are we gone eat
Throw 100s out the roof white folks say thats a felony
I’mma keep thuggin, thuggin, Bitches show me love
Off in the club throw a hundred in the club
Yeah niggas mean muggin
I don’t really give a damn, I don’t really give a damn
9 on my waste and new clip when I jam

If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof

Got bands like I play with the Nets
So sick, pass me the Kleenex
So sick, wipe my nose with the check
Touch down in a 2012 jet
Plugged in, ain't talking Internet
Make movie like Cinemax
Bad bih know how to cook crack
Now the whole hood going in a trap attack
Got the feet itching like chicken pox
Got a nigga mad cause a nigga re-rock
Ice on my neck looking like a freeze pop
Got the bitch sucking on my dick like a ring pop
Quick to shoot a nigga just like a slingshot
Top shooter nigga put me on top shot
Came from the bottom now a nigga at the top
Shawty got sick when she seen the top drop

Fucking with the bird got sick

Bad ass bitch she sick

Leopard print Versace, I look like I belong in a zoo
Diamonds so cold, caught the flu
So sick, make a young nigga puke
In the lab smoking gas like Snoop
Sipping on the lean like the shit hot soup
Finessing on the plug with the Reggie Bush juke
And I keep the blow like a nigga play the flute
Coughing on the gas, bronchitis
In the kitchen water whipping, making Miley Cyrus
Pot is so sick like the shroom caught a virus
Pockets on fat while you niggas on a diet
Fucking with the squad, he done start a double riot
Bounce nigga shit, I don't stand in line
Bad bitches in the club sniffing my lines
Water whip the brick, hit it with the blowdryer

Fucking with the bird got sick
Ice on my neck so sick
Bad ass bitch she sick
Murcielago coupe so sick
So sick, so sick, so sick, so sick
Fucking with the bird got sick

Murcielago coupe so sick
So sick, so sick, so sick, so sick
Y'all fucking with the bird got sick
Got a ice on my neck so sick

Fucking with the birds on the counter, bird flu
Beat a nigga in the wind, make a nigga throw the towel
Spent 10 racks on a sick Audemar
Put a H in my bedroom, put a H in the car
Think I'm a DJ with the work, remix
Red on the bottom of the shoe, piru
Wrist sick like Michael Jordan when he had the flu
Got a bad ass bih and she dripping Swagu
So sick, sneezing on the track, achoo
Black and white coupe look like an 8-ball

Fucking with the bird got sick
Ice on my neck so sick
Bad ass bitch she sick
Murcielago coupe so sick
So sick, so sick, so sick, so sick
Fucking with the bird got sick
Ice on my neck got sick

Got a bad ass bitch she sick
Murcielago coupe so sick
So sick, so sick, so sick, so sick
Y'all fucking with the bird got sick
Got a ice on my neck so sick

This that rich nigga shit

Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit

Rich nigga got money like Oprah
Hunned 50 bands, cash in the sofa
Trap phone, juggin off of Motorola
Got money on the table like Costa
2 cups in the morning, I’m leaning
In the Maserati just like Nemus
Got a red bad bitch suck ceiling
Feels good to be rich, I’m dreamin
20 bands for a show, QC I’m froze
I catch a bitch on go
Push white like snow, made a mill off blow
And I’m still getting mo
Can’t trust no bitch, my wrist game sick
Got 4-5 whips, young niggas takin trips, motherfucker I’m rich

This that rich nigga shit

Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit

Plugged in like cable
Pull up in that Aston Martin coupe
With the forgiato rims, I ain’t takin no favor
I got so much money, blow my know it’s 20’s
Trap house jumpin like Buzz runnin
Got commas on commas, countin up, eatin lasagna
Took yo bitch to Benihana
Back then in that Honda, 5-50 from my mama
Bitch I’m hotter than the sauna
Reach down for a Audemar
Coulda buy a new car but my numbers go retard
No key, just push start
Rich ass nigga gotta push spot, nose up

This that rich nigga shit
This that rich nigga shit
I just can’t stop on a band
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, rich nigga shit
Rich nigga shit, this that rich nigga shit

I’m the one you be texting
I’m the reason you don’t stress when shit gets hard
And anything you want, it’s all yours
They don’t know

You don’t be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but keep it cool
Cause they don’t

They don’t even know that I know you’re feeling me and you walk around like you don’t know
They don’t even know that you been down since that nigga trippin now you ebnd over
They don’t even know that we made it
She helped me with my dedicatin
I get on my knees and I’m prayin, thank God for this lady
They don’t know nothing about me, no nothing about you
Keep it that way, cool, they don’t know
If I go way back we’ve been fuckin with each other since high school
They don’t even know that she keep a 44
And the Berkin bag might go boom
Just telling you something good bout her
You may know nothing about her

They don’t know

You don’t be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but keep it cool
Cause they don’t

They don’t know Offset
They don’t even have a clue
They don’t know
When a nigga was still fucked up
When they called me clear move
Every move
Bitch left me but you
He was there
Yo Offset is feelin’ you
Your head game is critical
I’m touching your body, I’m giving a physical
These bitches they hatin’, they envy you
If a nigga get pulled over she gon hold the work
It should be a crime how she hold a nigga down
All the hoes off cus she said her feelings hurt
Up and down’s the relationship but we gon make it work
Blowin OG in the wind
Then fuss when I show her a chicken
So much loyalty, so much loyalty
Baby you know I’m bout the business
They know that, and yea I’m right up out of yo shit
They don’t know
And you say you wanna have salons
So I paid for her tuition, I had her schooled

They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Everything cool when they money going in
And everything bad when they money going out
Don’t want the people running in yo house
So the best thing you do is close your mouth
Never never snitch thats what daddy told me
And I never serve a nigga that sleep off in the streets
He told me If I try em then I’m gonna need heat
So I keep a Mac-11 tucked under my seat
I’m a goon gorilla so I call up Willy B
2 cup sippin on something light pink
Diamonds clear like water you can dive off in the sea
Designer I paid for it sauces all on me

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Money going in and out like intercourse
Gave my mamma 8 bands just to go to the store
Gave my bitch 5 bands just to seek and play
Front my migo the work cause he said he wanna serve
Lil cuz said he wanna be a trapper one day
I said not to do that cause its not the right way
He said big cuz how am I gonna get the cake
I gave him 10 bands told him gone put that shit away
It put a smile on my face, every time i see my cuz he got a smile on his face
Try to take my money know i be strapped up with the wooly

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Money Going in like a plug in the wall
Fuckin with the BMG leave ya hostage like saw
Whatcha need I got the soft and the stupid ass raw
Hit the stupid ass raw end up with the lock jaw
The pack hit ya hard make ya have flashbacks
What you got petroleum you know thats the gas
Hit ya bitch once then I threw her off the glass
You know I had to pass but don’t call me Steve Nash
Lost about a pound to the motherfuckin’ feds
Money coming in we got the long bread
Money coming in cause the money get finessed

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Question
How does it feel to follow my blueprint step by step
But still watch me win the crown?
Suckas

How does it feel to push them forgies on that Benz?
How does it feel to put that Rollie round yo wrist?
How does it feel to put yo feet in those kicks?
How does it feel to walk around with a big dick?
How does it feel to be real? How does it feel?
How does it feel to blow a mill? How does it feel?
How does it feel to have yo wrists on chill?
How does it feel to have them young niggas that gon kill?

Aks Marty foreign, broke niggas be borin
Hunned pounds of that kush shit, weed it we mowin
Wake up in the morning, how big are we tourin?
Yo sweet drip in my apartment, pinkslip out front
My lil niggas stay gunnin
Them hoe niggas they be runnin
These niggas ain’t real street niggas, they gotta show me something
In the jungle with the mics, trippin like keep conscious
Vets hear that loud pack so they can’t smell nothing

How does it feel to push them forgies on that Benz?
How does it feel to put that Rollie round yo wrist?
How does it feel to put yo feet in those kicks?
How does it feel to walk around with a big dick?
How does it feel to be real? How does it feel?
How does it feel to blow a mill? How does it feel?
How does it feel to have yo wrists on chill?
How does it feel to have them young niggas that gon kill?

Yo main bitch, she wit it
Ass out, no tippin
Ballin out with my pimp, cross over Scotty Pippen
Yo main nigga, he wishin
Hand rolled up stinky
Might be bad til you get it
Red bottom she pickin
Then my hoe won’t have a ticket
Fabreger but no fendy
Ray bands on 50
The roof gone, the loud drinkin
Rose got me tipsy
I’m a boss, bitch I hurt feelings
When she get all that mind, she swallowing al my children

How does it feel to push them forgies on that Benz?
How does it feel to put that Rollie round yo wrist?
How does it feel to put yo feet in those kicks?
How does it feel to walk around with a big dick?
How does it feel to be real? How does it feel?
How does it feel to blow a mill? How does it feel?
How does it feel to have yo wrists on chill?
How does it feel to have them young niggas that gon kill?



I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'm a always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it
I'm goin' through it, man this shit so crazy
'07, lost my brother, 15 years in them cages
Now my grandma rest in peace, that was my first lady
Thousand dollar specs on my face to block the haters
Goin' through it right now but still chasin' the paper
My bitch f*cked the whole team, I never should have saved her
And now I'm goin' crazy, cause I'm just goin' through it
I still walk around with Rugers cause I like to shoot 'em
I thought I loved that bitch to the mothaf*ckin' core
I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got me in a Porsche
Money, money, money, money got
I'm rollin' up a 3-5
Feds watchin' me, still servin' J's, I'm paranoid
I'm goin' through it, my niggas in the slammer
I had to go to Wal-Mart and collect some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin'
Do numbers water whippin', Young Quavo, yeah I did it
My bitch, she smashed the whole team, damn that ho too friendly
So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, ain't leavin' my wealth to none of these bitches
Cause once you dead and gone, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Water whippin', show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley
I've been goin' through it, shit been crazy
2000, lost my cousin, cried like a baby
My ancestors been goin' through it, back then in slavery
Now the time faster, I am the master
Could've been me back then, nigga woulda been like "F*ck your master"
My name Takeoff, I am NASA
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, pop a zan like she pop a gun
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond
I'm goin' through it
2000, lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Made
Just lost my grandmomma
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Done took so many losses, it's only right that we win



We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
No, no, no, no

The way that I whip it no Chef Boyardee they wanna know the recipe
I pop a pint, and I pop me a eight, now I'm movin' slower than a centipede
Twenty bit**es runnin' round the lobby, suckin', fuc*** just to say they did it
I done fuc*** so many bitc***, I saw many a** and tit***, it's ridiculous
Get on my knees and I pray and forgive me for my sins know I do the wrong and rights
Situation feel right when I'm wrong, but a ni**a feel wrong when I'm right
Gianni Versace cover my eyesight
Kid Cudi ni**a trappin' day and night
I be in the water with the sharks and they bite
These real diamonds, ni**a, we will knock it off the lights

All my ni**a from the slums, only girl I love is my momma
All my ni**as from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
Walkin' round the city with a nine in my pants and a knot in ‘em
Switcharoo your bit*h, we flippin' that ho like a spatula
For real my ni**a don't run up on me cause you ni**a don't know me
Ni**as that know me don't show me cause they know I got it on me
Feel like The Rock I'm giving out people elbows to all you Jabronis
Your ni**as loaners my owners
Macaroni cottage cheese, 20 bandz in my Balmain jeans
No limit Master P, bout it bout it on the scene
When I take a pee, I see codeine
Hotboxin' backwoods in the lambo, can't breathe
If I smoke then it's expensive weed, I give you the sack if you find the seed

All my ni**as from the slums, only girl I love is my momma
All my ni**as from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my ni**as with choppere


Came up from the bottom, now a ni**a having power
Used to trap and slang powder, new Rolly ice on my hours
I got the bird like a owl, I'm in New York smokin' on sour
Look at you ni**as is cowards, the bricks surrounded like flower
I got her sangin' just like Mya, suckin' and fuc**n' until she get tired
Feeling like Donald Trump, bi*ch you is fired
All my ni**as blowing up like a fuc*in' tire
Late nights in the bando feel like The Wire
My ni**as heard that you snitchin, where is your wire?
And it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer
All my ni**as from the slums, only girl I love is my momma
All my ni**as from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
We gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my ni**as pull up with choppers



Water, Water, Water
And i can't keep my head out of the stick
Water

Karate choppin at birthday get a slaughter
Choppin and capping i just made my clothes
I got the rappin and trappin yo
Water be splashing



Gimme the beat and I be the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I be the cake
Gimme, just gimme
Gimme the beat and I be the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I be the cake
Gimme, just gimme

Gimme the pot and I give you a taste
Remember the day, my mama started crying
'Cause I pulled up in that NASCAR
These rappers be acting like Hasselhoff
Passed you the rock and you scared to ball
I got yo lil bitch on a date at the mall
He know that you gone, she scared to call
When you get home she dead my dog
I fit a hunnid ten racks in some pockets
Free all my niggas they eatin on pockets

Gimme the beat and I be the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I be the cake
Gimme, just gimme
Gimme the beat and I be the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I be the cake
Gimme, just gimme



Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay Tuned!

Woosh, pack gone missing
Migos!

Huh, huh, huh, gone!

Fuck nigga I just took the set, I just took the pot
It's nothing but 33 Larry Birds in the trunk
We trappin' and cappin' the top floor
Why the trunk got it smelling like skunk?
Gas, gas, they callin' up 12 he gon' mad
Here take all these pocket rockets bitch
Put him in yo' Birkin bag
What you gon' do at the top floor
Grab the parachute, hit the window
Quavo you trippin' hell naw
I ain't gettin' caught with all this indo


Pack gone missing, I'm no magician
My diamonds they flyin' like Bobby and Whitney
Walking around with a 50
You mad cause I'm rich
Cuffin' and loving that bitch
We smash and we switch
I pull up to bando with bricks in a Bent'
I stand round the trap like a fence
Finessin' I run with the money
I'm wrappin' and shippin' the dummy, Houdini me
The kitchen I'm mixing them chemicals nigga no chemistry
Rich niggas in Paris they takin' them pictures
She suck it, she swallow, you probably kiss her
Woosh, Pack gone missing, Rich The Kid still finessin'
I'm RICH!


Got so many hoes on my line you think I'm fishing
She might be a girl, turn around that thing gone missing
Her and her start kissing, liquor in here system
Don't be standing near me in the club, go get some bitches
Got a crib without a ceiling when I hit it you gon' feel it
It's my new motto, nigga, anyone can get it
Damn smoking papers, my new crib come with acres
Gettin' cake with just the wave of a hand
You think I had a favor sump'n

I think it's a ghost in the city
I hustle I feel like I'm Nipsy
Patrolling you missing, so where did he go?
As anybody seen the pack lately
They knockin' my door like the candy lady
I don't know what the fuck want these niggas
These niggas be snitchin', bitches want a baby
Beep, beep! Truck load
Whippin' and cookin' up Anna Nicole
Versace got me travelin' across the globe
Blue money, blue hundreds
The gas smellin' like it's fungus
Woosh, pack gone missing
Ride round the city, 30 round extensions


Shout out to all my connects in the hood I'm finally famous
Shout out Big Sean and I don't mean the rapper that coke made me famous
Woosh, hey, they try to get me for the packs
Huh, I had to jump it straight out of the pot I be cookin' the oil
Don't got no connect for you pussy ass niggas you'll never be loyal
Beyoncé with all of this money you know that I gotta big ego
Robin Hood I'm in the hood and I'm tryna look out for my people




I’m fucking with your bitch
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
I might go buy a brick
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich

Whip it up like dough
Brick white and it look like snow
I’m cooking on my stove
Straight rollin’ you already know
You already know it’s sold
You already know I’m gone
I’m gone off dro I’m blown
Don’t know if I’ll make it home
Bitch I’m rolling off that molly
Smoking on that molly
Drinking on Bacardi while I’m stunting through the lobby
Got more bitches down in Follies shaking that for 20 dollars
Young rich niggas all around me
Bitch we ain’t nothing but some ballers




Since when I ain't get no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?
Since when I ain't count no stacks? Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when I ain't f*ck your ass? Since when you ain't suck me up?
Since when I ain't hit the club? Since when I ain't throw the cash up?
Since when? Since when? Since when? You lyin'
Since when? Since when? Since when? Are you lyin'?
Since when I ain't ball on hard? Since when I ain't sell no rock?
Since when I ain't count no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?
Since when? Turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up, since when?
Since '91, I was gettin' it in
Countin' nothin' but them Benjamins
'09 in True Religion
You decided to do it in 2010
I decided to move it to Robin
You couldn't buy it, your pockets was hurtin'
I mothaf*ckin' do it
Walk up in the club rockin' nothin' but Louis
Y'all niggas flexin' 'bout the shit that you did
My nigga, we been, kickin', pimpin'
Codeine when we sippin'
250 for the lenses
CL drop, Benzes
Just went to the doctor yesterday
Told me chill on the lean for my kidneys
Laughed at him, said "You is silly"
Two bitches in the kitchen, water whippin'
But it ain't no forensics
Niggas try to rob me, I wouldn't risk it
Since when I ain't kill you with the Louis?
Since when I ain't kill you with the mothaf*ckin' Gucci?
Since when I ain't kill you with the mothaf*ckin' Truey?
Since when a young nigga like me didn't do it?
Since when a young nigga didn't flex?
Since when a young nigga didn't count no checks?
Since when a young nigga didn't hit the mall?
Since when a young nigga didn't
Since when I ain't pull up in a Jag?
Since when I ain't pull up in a Benz
Since when I ain't f*ck no foreign bitch
Then I f*ck her twin
Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when a nigga lighted up mid?
Since when
Since when you see me in the club with designers on my
Back then, I've been doin' it sense
It's in my blood, it's my skin
Ain't nothin' out here ain't did
Ain't have a kid cause I
Since when a young nigga ain't do it? Since when my pants wasn't Truey?
Since when, might pull up with the Louis, and I'm pullin' up with the Gucci
Since when I pull up with that foreign coupe, look like I'm in a movie
Call me young Quavo, Tom cruisin', smokin' on the gas
Since when I ain't take your ho? Since when I ain't make her my ho?
Since when I ain't put her in the trap? Countin' cheese in the bando
Since when my VV don't shine? Since when my bitch wasn't fine?
Since when
On the block and she
