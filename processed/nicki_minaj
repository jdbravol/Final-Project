Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my

I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it
And a good girl in my tax bracket
Got a black card that'll let Saks have it
These Chanel bags is a bad habit
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks
My Maybach, black matted
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it
And I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit
Feelin' myself, back off
'Cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
He be thinking about me when he whacks off
Wax on? Wax off
National anthem, hats off
Then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Lemme get a number two, with some Mac sauce
"On The Run Tour", with my mask off

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my

Changed the game with that digital drop
Know where you was when that digital popped
I stopped the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world stop…
Carry on

Kitty on fleek, pretty on fleek
Pretty gang always keep them niggas on geek
Ridin'-ridin' through Texas, feed him for his breakfast
Everytime I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said "Damn Nicki it's tight," I say "Yeah nigga you right"
He said "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe"
I said "Yes daddy I do, gimme brain like NYU"
I said "Teach me, nigga, teach me. All this learnin' here is by you"

Panky full of that bounce baby

Cookin' up that base, lookin' like a kilo

Ridin' through Texas, ridin' through Texas
Smoke it all off, talkin' bout that high-grade
Baby hold up, I can kill your migraine
Ridin' through Texas, ridin' through Texas

Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let that ho know -- he in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'?
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40,I am a Rap legend
Just go ask the Kings of Rap, who is the Queen and things of that
Nature? Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser
Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's
Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all of that D
Cause we dope girls we flawless, we the poster girls for all this
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas in my call list
I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow

Rrrrrrrrrr!
You like it don't you? Snitches!
Young Money



Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
Lance Stephenson

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you, the bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I been praising, my nigga that money talk
I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only



Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless
Lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless
Largest in charge
And born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly
Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like

Mike WiLL Made-It, nigga
SremmLife
Black Barbies in the city
Fat ass and pretty titties
Get dummies for they money
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive ’em
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em

That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I'm a fuckin' black barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always fuck him like I'm sorry
Who the fuck is gon’ protect her?
If I really gotta check her
Peter Piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker

No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone

I see these silly nigga’s flexin', it’s a no zone
You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said "Oooh shit!"
Picked up my phone cause I had to call "Bullshit!"
These bitches havin’ nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Hahaha, get it? Douche-...hahahahahahaha
Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it
Now I'm prayin'  all my foreigns don't get deported
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits


Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle



Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We’re overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin’ wasn’t tasteful
Even though you out here lookin’ so ungrateful
I'mma keep it movin’ be classy and graceful
I told 'em it’s no friends in the game, you ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible, that
They love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don’t wish death on ‘em, I just reflect on 'em

Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We’re overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

Yo, people will love you and support you when it’s beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga’s life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now, it’s kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy, when I’m causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on ‘em

Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We’re overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time we’ll be fine
In due time

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love



He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

They holler at me but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me "make me a wife"
I tell her, "Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas?" She say, "What about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'mma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lying
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

They holler at me but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

I know you want it, boy
I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushin'
I'm a let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon

Now you all up in the sauce, cause you wanna be down!?
Never let a clown nigga, try to play you
Fuck his best friends, then make 'em "yes" men"
And get a dick pic, and then you press "Send"
And send a red heart, and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends, love how your pussy taste
My wrist look like, I am a jewel thief
But that's just cause, I am a boss bitch
Now macaroni cheese, and grill my swordfish

Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, I'm a boss-ass  -
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if -

If he catch my drift, he could catch my jizz
I be out in Cali, runnin' all my businesses
I be out in Cali, watchin' back my Christmas vids
Every time I fuck 'em, yes, I tell him "This is his"
Looked down at it, and I said, "This is big!"
Man, my game so cold I said, "This is rigged"
Best flow in the game, this is not a lie
Tell 'em bitches, cross their T's and dot their I
I-I-I-I-I-I- I came back, bitches' flows still boring
I said, "Damn, man, go back to whoring"
You know I still lead the league, in scoring -
You know I'm still bad, and I'm still foreign
I'mma give bitches, time to get hot
Chill out at the game, New York, Knickerbock
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'mma destroy chicks a lot, OH -
But on the real, I'm in album mode
I just dropped this freestyle, 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound

I hear you...
When I'm back on the prowl
You bitches better have my money
Cause I'm comin' for you
Ooh, ooh...

Ask Birdman who the five-star bitch is

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

You should say it right now

Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

Rihmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

Its a heart for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's crying
Its trust for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's lying




Ain't yellin' cut, when it's shootin' time
Sign up, it's recruitin' time
Big wigs, with a suit and tie
And them big things got two inside
Fuck wrong wit' these ho niggas?
Don't do coke, I don't blow niggas
I don't tell niggas, I show niggas
And it's never less than like 4 niggas
Hot sauce and ketchup nigga
He telling and he hiding
But real niggas still catch a nigga
Cop Raris? I don't test drive 'em
Home theaters, can't Best Buy 'em
These niggas that I roll with
Don't let a single thing get by 'em
King pins and them drug lords
Chi-Town, no gun laws
Broke bitches that talk shit?
Now them the bitches I stunt for
Malcolm X daughter, came at me
Lookin' ass niggas ain't happy
Rolled out with some Latin Kings
And some eses in 'em plain khakis
Smack bitches, no smack cam
Closed fists, no back hands
Pop pussy on a hand stand
They suckin' dick like it's band camp
Call Webb and then call Nitty
Queens niggas in, it's all hoodies
Kidnappin' and then rob niggas
Call D-Roc for a biggie
Pussy ass little rap niggas

Got a money fetish, I'mma fly to Venice
Got a big house, I can play some tennis
Lil Herb, what's good?
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good

Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

I'm a young nigga, I be gettin' money
Take your bitch from you
And these niggas don't get no respect
I'mma stay 100 'til I'm 6 under
Matter fact, I gotta keep it 150
For every nigga that's gon' come with me
I'm on Roc Block with a new semi
And a blue Bentley, it do 160
Smoke a lot a of weed, like fuck kidneys
Put a dutch in me, got a 40 on me
I don't trust any, and if any nigga ever try to end me
I'mma die shooting, prayin' God forgive me
You too busy hating, you can't get no paper
Why are y'all so silly? Straight killers
I can call so many, I don't love no bitches
But my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood, came from Kingston Food
Shorties standing, in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang, we don't say no names
If you talk to cops, I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station, in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations, in your conversations
Shoot a opposition, with no hesitation
You get my position, then you better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I got old shit, killin' your shit
On a couple tracks I just never played it
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis

Wanna make love, love, love

King of the skreets
And when these suckas see me, they should bow to my feet
And kiss the ground underneath
I look down at the beef
That shit childish to me
Two hundred thousand to see me
And it's been sold out for weeks
Can't brush shoulders with me
These stones in my choker are 2 karats apiece
Look like boulders to me
Damn, who colder than me?
You think he colder than me?
You more bipolar than me
You talkin' crazy
I'm tryna book Beyoncé for my wedding day
I'm the type of nigga, spend a million on a wedding cake
Niggas hate, but hesitate
They hate to see ya elevate
I just left out the gym
I'm 'bout to take a swim and meditate
Woo!
Now it's time to celebrate
Ask me why I'm smilin'
I say, "'Cause I make two mil' a day"
And I might take your bitch and pay her bills

Hahaha, ahhhhh

You got an F on your test

I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love
I wanna make love, love, love
She say the money make her wanna make love
Wanna make love, love, love, huh

I love to see the money stack up
Wanna make love, love, love

My name Barbie, bitch - my name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch

Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone, cause the tears don't end

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing, the crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o

I fly with the stars, in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn’t mean you’re alive
Don’t worry bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it’s my empire
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire -
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath  -
With a sling,this very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring -
And I will retire with the crown, Yes!
No, I’m not lucky, I’m blessed,Yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!
But I couldn’t do it all alone, We!
Young Money raised me,grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it’s crazy
Cause I’m still hood, Hollywood couldn’t change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn’t faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated,best believe that  -
When we're done, this moment will be syndicated, I don't know - This night, just reminds me of -
P-P-P-P-Put ya drinks up!
It’s a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Yeahh, yeah, yeah, ugh
What I tell ‘em hoes bow bow bow to me, drop down to ya knees
Young Money the Mafia that’s word to Lil' Cease
I’m in The Dominican Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout-out to the CEO 500 degrees
Shout-out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year, we ain’t get the memo
Young King, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed, he ain’t even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain’t even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin’ married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, oh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can’t believe we really made it, I’m partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!
I’m really tryna make it more than what it is
Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives!

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

This is my moment, I waited all my life, I can just tell it's time
Drifting away, I’m one with the sunsets, I have become alive

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive, alive



I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up; flatscreen
Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki," asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars; sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho; punt
Forced trauma; blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag-a-lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie; camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch!
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?"
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd

The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill; mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning Eli!!

All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

You just need to leave, boy

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song

So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies



Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please

I'll be back at eleven, you just act like a peasant
Got a bow on my panties, because my ass is a present
Yeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'
I be laughing when you beggin' me, to just put the head in
Let me sit on your face, it's ok you can play with it
When I'm bouncin' it, chill out and don't you make a mistake with it
Let me see what you're workin' with, If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it

You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Oooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby I'ma need you to beg for it

Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please

Gimme brain, assume the position
Make me way smarter, like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition
Get head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission
You make it come down, you make it run down
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the rundown
You got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry

I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no

Oooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it

Baby I'ma need you to beg for it

Cause we are just animals
I want you on all fours
It's non negotiable
So do as I say

Tent for me, tent for me, get me bodied
Long hair, no makeup, doing pilates
Those niggas don't step on my damn Zanottis

Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake pops
Sleeping on me, no mattress though

I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said "let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines

I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities, and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do, if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you

So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you?

I came out lookin' to party, and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

Yo, yo, cause I came out
'09, when promoters brought Wayne out
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out
I been bad, like cuttin' school and stayin' out
I been hotter than, vacationin' and layin' out
I sat back and watched how it was playin' out
They diss me, but runnin' and took the same route
Uhn, but no, they not Nicki
Wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki
Not a website but get money, this is fifty
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy
This shit ain't got no more integrity
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Soon as I came in, I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali of these bitches, and that can't be debated
I never chicken'd out, skated, I know they mad that I made
All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

So good, so real, so good, yeah
I'ma win again
I'ma win again, yeah
I'm Meryl Streep to all these bitches, they can't do what I do
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, "Why you?"
Yeah, I know that they mad
But I'ma shit on my critics some more

I am, I am
I am still gonna do, what he sent me to do
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
They know I am a champion
All champions do
It's all champions do

I did it for everybody out here on their own
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages
And never tell me no
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong
But you should know I bought 'em
I changed it, I changed it
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though
I changed it, I changed it

Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they on the same shit
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they still on the same shit
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

The big 3 on the court, bitch at them bleachers
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread dissin' Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin' pills, but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switched flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the bitch is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run

Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up
And when I come, get your change cup
These bum bitches never change up

Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
Oh my god, I changed

You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

No more CMB shit, I changed it
Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit
Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game
And y'all chump change
I'm just sayin'

Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up
And when I come, get your change cup
These bum bitches never change up

Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang, Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang

Yo, I guess I went commercial, just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set, though, I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global; your ad is local
When we shot it was a lot of different agricultures
So I laugh at hopefuls; "Nicki pop!"
Only thing that’s pop is my endorsement op
Fuck around and I'll have to go and reinforce the Glock

Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang, Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang

Yo, is it me, or did I put these rap bitches on the map again?
You mad ’cause I’m at the Grammy's with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I'm who you be channelin’
Why they never bring you name up at the panel, then?
Hottest MCs, Top 5; you need money? I got mine
More knots than Eric on Basketball Wives

Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang, Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang

I couldn’t do your TV show, I needed ten more mil
Not ten on the back, I need ten on signin'
Give that shit to a washed up bitch, I’m winnin’
‘cause if I had a label I would never sign, you hoes
Take bitches to school, then I Columbine these hoes
I hear the slick shit, bitch, you washed
All you hoes cryin’—Christopher Bosh

Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang, Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang

Now when I tell ‘em it’s Barbie, bitch
Yes, I really do mean that it’s Barbie, bitch
Ask Mattel, they auctioned my Barbie, bitch
Raggedy Ann could never be a Barbie, bitch
You at the bottom of the barrel scrapin’
I’m out in LA at the Ice Age tapin’
I’m chillin’ at the top, I got ample time
Bite me—Apple sign, ha

Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang, Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang

Kush on my breath, cocaine on my tongue
Eat that pussy, make it numb, she can't feel herself cum
Got a body on my gun, fuck the world with my thumb
Pop a molly, smoke a blunt, that mean I'm a high roller
My ex wanna work it out, bitch, try yoga
Two hoes in the bed, tell them hoes slide over
Excuse my French, two bitches and moi
That a Nicki Ménage à trois, ha
Tunechi

Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang, Bang, my shit bang
B-B-Bang

Um, my shit so cold, man, it don't even stank-o
Destructive ass nigga, watch me break the bank
Weezy F and the 'F' is for "fill in the blank"
I say shout out Mack Maine, backyard bully
And the weed purple like a black girl pussy
Word, middle finger on the trigger
So you know that mean fuck a nigga

Bang, my shit bang

And she bang, b-b-bang
Bang bang, she go bang bang
We bang, bang-bang
Bang, b-b-b-bang, bang, bang, blood gang
Hey!



Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were

The one who had came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

Am I queen of fools?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish jewels
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do

Cause I keep thinking you were
The one who had came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark

And now the people
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on



This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now? This took dedication
This is meditation,higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I-I-I-I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half, like they flunk they math
Bitches ain't half, cut up crack, up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This is that Run-and-Get-a-Dollar-for-The-Ice-Cream-Cone
'cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's, only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers; niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharika
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha


Yeah, okay
We made it to America
'c remember when I used to stay with Erica
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that


Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate


What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Happily ever after
Champions

We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sex in the lounge

Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'mma take ya down
I'mma have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow



Bitches ain't serious, man, these bitches delirious
All these bitches inferiors, I just pimp my interiors
I just pick up and go; Might pick up a ho
Might give conversation, if you kick up the dough
Never mind my money; never mind my stats
Every bitch wanna be me, you can find 'em in Saks
Pink Friday, two milli; "Super Bass," triple plat
When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winnin'
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same
When I'm sitting with Anna, I'm really sitting with Anna
Ain't a metaphor punchline, I'm really sitting with Anna
Front row in Oscar de la Renta posture
Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my impostor
Put these bitches on lock out, where the fuck is your roster?
I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

Shake my head, yo, I'm mad,ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But, this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Yeah, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
'cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

7-Up went and gave my commercial to Cee-Lo
But don't tell them I said it, let's keep it on the D-low
If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But, you know it'll cost about six figures long
But, you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets?
Flying spurs for hers, mean I'm fucking above it
And I just got the ghost, and I'm calling it Casper
But this shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I styling?, I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbating, but I'm feeling myself
Paparazzi is waiting, cause them pictures will sell
Now don't you feel a-stupid, yeah, that's egg on your face
If you weren't so ugly, I'd put my dick in your face

Dick in your face
Put my dick your face, yeah!

Shake my head, yo, I'm mad,ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But, this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Yeah, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly

I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'll kind of make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin' but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah its strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me, me, me
Me against them, me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more flya'

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly

Everybody wanna' try to box me in
Suffocatin' everytime it locks me in
Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Caus' I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation, I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear, that is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear, and I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly

Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win

Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win


I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly



They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing I could've went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame?"
Let me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Who I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties
12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding baby
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding baby
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your all for yours

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Boom boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wondering if he can understand my lingo

Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

The night is still young
The night is still young

Shorty I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
And for your loving I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and more of

He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody who plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

Shorty I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
And for your loving I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and more of

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam'
Hot damn make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
"Konvict" just like Akon
Cause you know the Snitches be putting the Jake on

Shorty I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
And for your loving I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler

Feels like I’m–

How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it belittle me?
You was heckling me, now it’s monotony winning regularly
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in ‘em, I kill ‘em and then I skin ‘em
The contract was signed but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ahh, ha hahahaha ha
I’m the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall’
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they neva' been
As long as I am in the game, you’ll never win
I’m on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!

I fly, I fly high, I’m blazing, I’m blazing, feels like I’m blazing

This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I’m flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
‘rari six hundred horses, that’s my chariot of fire?
Where we flying, they can’t find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I’m Marc Jacobs, I think I’m Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'mma grab your waist then, I'mma grab your face and
Then I'mma taste it, then I'mma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in Yeezy hurt the beat
Like he fucked her best friend and she let him back in
And he just did it again, He crazy, he blazin, he off the deep end
I’m blazin’, I’m flagrant, I'm crazy I’m saying
Too much for the World so they abbreviate him
His past is her fav, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per’ uhh
Prada coloured beige
It obvi’ we the ish and I’m rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff’
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag looking magnif’
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin’
Nicki what you think? I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks

Feel the beat of the drum
Move like ya really wanna be number 1
You can beat out the comp
Adrenaline rush 'cus...
You have been identified as a hustla'
Topic of the discussion but beat it like a percussion
And chuck the deuce up and tell 'em it's just love

Damn diggity-dog
Let them bums stay mad 'cause we livin' it up

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, "What you doing, Nicki?" Branding
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Want another round? Well then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
Cause these bitches tripping, no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
Send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Bitches wanna play a game? Go and see Saw

You know my pockets fatter, than that little Vine kid
They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid
I mean look, your bitch came off an island

I'm out in Hollywood,left off Highland

See, I'm all about my wamables
See, I'm all about my wamables



Yo, SB,I think it's my time
You know why? My tears have dried
And I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me you would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the choke hold on now, they screaming, "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm still the one to beat
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets
I am getting it in until the end I gotta go
Go, go hard!

Carter called, lemme get the car key,you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine,hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good-a
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you could-a
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm telling LA Reid, to step his bid up
And I'm telling President Carter, he picked a winner,bitches like Nelly and Kelly, got a dilemma
These birds all fly south, in the winter
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'mma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
No muuuuz-zlllllle, hahahaha
Bitches is softer than Al Dente,cut from a different kente
Tell em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas, wheelying them Kawasakis
Shout out, to the Vackee's, Saltfish Ackees
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling, kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland, is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj, or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the choke hold on now
They screaming, "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win
I’m still looking around for my competition
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go
Go hard!

From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp, but he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip, so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship, check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch, I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip, and if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal; no Olympic, but I can still make you tumble and flip
You fucking with me if you fucking with Nic, they ain't fucking with me, they ain't fucking with Nic
Your girlfriend her decision is split cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fucking Nic, as long as she be fucking rich
That's why I keep my luggage cause I swear y'alls a fucking trip
Young Money dungeon bitch, my swagger is punching bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun "Gunovich"
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch

Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me

I just heard that I was the baddest in the town
So I came down and had to pick up my crown
Went to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound
Baddest underground since Harriet Tub
That's why when I come around they hurry and run
And I know it ain't math but I carry the one
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns
Yao Ming, I'mma need a couple Asians
Sayonara, bitches, on a Kawasaki blazin'
Ayo, Rihanna, gotta come up off dem bajans

My madda cunt Trinis
My Jamaican bod gal, all my Guyanese?


I just found out that I was doper than Amy
Winehouse, maybe
Fresh out the navy
Fresher then a daisy
Used to be on Baisley
Young money bunny bitch please say the baby
Please stop callin' me, I'm such a rock star
Assalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar?
Give 'em my keys, tell 'em valet my car
B's pon da wheels, you can see them from far
Now all I need is a real mandingo
Gimmie good uhh and distribute my single
Bootleg the mixtape out in Nigeria
Hit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria
If he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where dem girls say aloha
See I got da first class pussy and he use to give me Coacha
Real good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur?


Ahh, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-wa wine
My wine is too dutty
Beam me up scotty
My wa-ba wine
My wine is too dutty

One, two, buckle my shoe
No one on the corner has swagger like I do
Keep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo
Keep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo
Excuse me, I'm sorry
I got the 45 special, don't worry
Cause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry
Now, where my West Indies?
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?
My madda cunt Trinis
My Jamaican bad gal, all my Guyanese?




You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin, you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you
Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?

You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit? How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that

What are we doin'? Cause you see through me
Cause you say "Nicki," and I say "Who me?"
And you say "No you," and I say "Screw you"
Then you start dressin', and you start leavin'
And I start cryin', and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin - yo!
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin', passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay you're right, just let it go
Okay you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit? How do you Do that?
How do you Do that?
How do you Do that?
How do you Do that?
How do you?

STOP! oooooh
STOP! oohhhh
Would you just stop lookin through me, cause I can't take it
No I can't take it

You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?

You see right through me do that shit
You see right through me how do you do that shit
How do you do that? How do you do that?
How do you do that? How do you do that?

This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

Daddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning, had us running down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it, how could I forget it? The pain is infinite
Nightmares of you killing my mother, the reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you 'cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like, I'm dying real slow
You was my friend and my man and my daddy, you was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me, 'cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question, it took this long, for me to learn my lesson
Cause now all I want is peace and get drama, finally understand the true meaning of karma

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

Please baby, forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was too busy tryna have fun
To conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil, I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you
I gotta let you know what you mean to me, when I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand, if it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

My voice projected, my life reflected
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I’m insecure
Yeah, I make mistakes
Sometimes I feel like I’m at the end of the road

I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

It's like all the good things
They fall apart like
Like Marilyn Monroe
Truth is, we mess up 'til we get it right
I don’t want to end up losing my soul

I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

Take me or leave me
I’ll never be perfect
Believe me, I’m worth it

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
Given' up, given' up, given' up

Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me

I'm the best

I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
Cause even when my daddy was on crack I was crack
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
Cause before they could begin, you told them it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick I'mma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so

It's okay
It's okay
Long as you know
Long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best




Maybe you died cause everybody ask me, "Where you at?"
I try to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW everytime you came through
You was the braveheart,you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me, that I needed to show
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me, you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I should've kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish, is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yeah, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us, when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media they ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back


And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

Who the hell is this?
While I'm watching the fight
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?

Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?

Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria

I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker

They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came
But that's words of Hip Hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona

Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew
Mami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through
I'm not running bitch, I bust my gun, hold on I hear somebody coming



Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

Every time I come and fuck with you
You make up all the rules
You ought to do it
Just because our car's moving
Are you in my fucking corner for real?
Or, are you plotting to kill?
I tell you just how I feel
But you never hear
Oh, why you take it like that?

Why you keep talking about it, you keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy if she could cut her wrist off

Put you in a room

South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap Korea and don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon
When mi did ah leave then take it down
True say mi come out of England and it done
True say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad Trinidad, my island

I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws
You're perfect in my eyes

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire

You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

I bet you're hard as stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous, but I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire

You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

Maybe you're the master of disguise
And you are putting on and
You're really the saint, the good one
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are then, baby, take me now

Beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

You shoulda left the other day
You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow




Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
Cause we pack shows, sell tix like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
Cause you know I only fuck with ballers
Yup them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like, "wetter than jacuzzi bitches"

Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch

Half a bar,  just to laugh at 'em
High school, if he ball, throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy, that's a no no
I only fuck with bad bitches, no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me, all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj, I'm the talk of the town now

Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch

Baddest, the baddest
My pussy's the fattest
I'm bad
Bad, Bad



She said "fuck Fendi", but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name, Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run to see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leavin' comments
And you know, that I got some more haters with me, might hit up This Is 50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothin' I do ever is good enough for the music biz

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
Cause if Nicki win, then all of ya'll gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris Lighty
When you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around, that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swirvin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches




Dear Wayne, if this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, there’s some things I should have said to you
First of all, every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man, I really am proud of you
Second of all, I gotta say thanks
You really did alot for my out of state banks
With that being said, let's get down to the real
I still don’t understand what went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you just to give me the word
You know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls that be flippin’ the bird
Tryna get up out the hood and get into the ‘burbs
But everything you said, was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don’t really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings just to wait on you
But what I don’t understand is why you told them you signed me
If you wasn’t ready to get totally behind me
I mean honestly, how could you deny me?
You know you’re Harry and I’ll always be Hermione

I’ve been lonely, I’ve been waiting for you
I’m pretending, and that’s all I can do
The love I’m sending ain’t making it through to your heart

Dear Wayne, I’m writing another letter cause
You never did respond, it’s been a couple months
See when I speak I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing that they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote
You see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up but now my times up
I swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad with some metaphors
Knockin’ on a set of doors
Knockin’ on heaven's doors
Let’s play a game, just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Let's act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes, started running to me
And you was running out of breath but you kept going
‘Cause you finally realized what you slept on
If you take your own life are you a sinner?
I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you’re reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
If you’re reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger




Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fucking best
You the fucking best
You the fucking best
You the fucking best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
I say you the fucking

Know you got a roommate, call me when its no one there
Put the key under the mat, and you know I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustom to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on
Thats when your the prettiest, I hope that you don take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it I'm the one to never get confused with cause


Ayo, you the only one that see the real Nicki
I could show you chill Nicki Cause of how you deal wit me
When they knock my blocks down you come and you build with me
Even though you real busy, you's so fuckin real Drizzy
It`s so amazing I figured out this world is ours with the taking
I figured out that when I go out an all those people scream that's some of them are living vicariously through me
That's why I put that "S" on ma chest and I`m gone
But on another note, let's have sex in my dorm
And I'ma make you beg, cause you look pretty when you beggin'
So meet me on the campus, I`ll be there around 11
So let me put my books down, excuse me if I look down
Guess I'm a little nervous, but I'm at your service
Look at what you took down
Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, other niggas never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
That's why I hold you down, every time you hit me up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
I make you beg for it, until I give it up
You say that same thing, every single time


Sex, Love, Pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too, claiming they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo fiend on
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back, and make yo fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots






I mean, you know
It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away
Young Money
That's-that's-that's just what we do
You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

I just came out of the motherfuckin' old school
Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools
Yeah, bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad "woof woof," flyer than a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they say I'm a Star Spangle
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner, I am the rap Hannah
Mo-mon-montana, so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes, but don't call me Santa


So I got a bad bitch mentality
Cause I just came from another galaxy
I be with the president up in the White House
If we in the Oval Office, then the lights out
Cause I am the Wicked Witch, I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I mean, I'm Nicki L-M-N-O-winsky
I mean, my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean Tinker, tell that nigga link her
Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker


1, 2, 3rd floor, hospital bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straightjacket crooked, I hear you lookin
I promise I'm hard and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes, I am
Right up in the cuckoo nest I land
I'm fly, now eat my bird shit
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm lookin' for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F Baby, no, Weezy F Crazy


When I do it, it get did-ed, I was fixing my fitted
Pull up in a 6 Series, she was fixing your Civic
When I do it, it gets done, 2 sticks in my bun
Pull up in a 6, hun, you was fixing to run, hoe
I get crazy, I get crazy
I get motherfuckin', motherfuckin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, that's what my name is
My name means crazy in cr-crazy language



Why is that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear sometimes it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percocets
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

I am who I am, uh!
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
I am who I am, uh!

I swear to God man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'ma fight your soul
Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'till death do us part?
Cause if not it's just best we both part
Cause how am I supposed finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease

It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am

I used to think that we’d run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

I used to think that we’d reunite
I’d be your wife in the real life
I thought that you’d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You’d reappear only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

You’ll always be mine, frozen in time

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic

It's automatic, I'm a run away train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
It's automatic, my condition's unknown
There's no remedy and no antidote
It's just the way that I am

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic

It's automatic, some might call it insane
I assure you, I'll be stuck in your brain
You'll be falling for me, boy
It's automatic when I'm rockin' the beat
Systematically, I'm droppin' your heat
It's just the way that I am

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic

Press rewind, p-p-press rewind
It's automatic, I-I'm Einstein
I'm lookin for that Einstein
Wales, London, Ireland
Scotland I can idle in
South Africa and Brazil
Shut the club down, bring the bill
Bri-ri-ri-ri-ring the bill
Br-bri-bri-bri-bring the bill
Bri-bri-bring the bill
Shut the club down
Bring the bill

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic

It must hurt to sell your album off PayPal
'Specially when you in the game 15, 20
You was hot when Shaq teamed up with Penny
Man, you was magic!
I mean, look at you now, ho, you just tragic!
You a tragedy, you a parody
Last name Ann, first name Raaaaaaggggedy
These goofy bitches is stupidity personified
Ayo, Wayne, you want it gully, or the Gaza side



I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid ass aim
Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill right?
Switched up the flow but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah I still might
I'mma just do me when it feel right
You could bring it anyday
Natural bad-ass, NBA
That's my initials, that's why officials
Don't blow the whistle, bang, bang, the pistol
And I'm bossy
Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn the flow nasty coffee
Don't you do like the pope and cross me

Yeah, this is my last chance
Last chance
Yeah, this is my last chance
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

—I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis they screamin' high pitch
Gun cock, pause—
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em, that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top, dot org

I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time
Could you believe now it’s right before my eyes
Anybody trying to stop me better not fuck with me this time
Shoot, I’m ready to shoot into the sky

Yeah, this is my last chance
Then shoot, I’m ready to shoot
I’m ready to shooooot
I’m ready to shoot

Only one chance, one bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one, yeah
Running through there and I put on the stars
Ohh, stick ‘em up, stick ‘em up
Only one chance, one bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one, yeah
The safety’s off and I put it on the stars
Ohh, stick ‘em up, stick ‘em up
I'm ready to shoot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready to shoot
This is my life and I only got one, yeah
The safety’s off and I put it on the stars
Get ready
I’m ready to shoot



If you move, I'll fall
I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby

I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me to love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
Yo, write it down, take a pictures, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
"I love Nicki" scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted

Ay! Can anybody hear me?
Ay! Can anybody hear me?
Ay! Can anybody hear me?
Ay! Can anybody hear me?



Ok, ok, ok... C'mon, listen...

Ye' ain't say nothing lil' mama I got those
And I'm about to bl-blow like snot nose
Oh no, no homo
This is for my niggas, my niggas that don't know
Please tell these rap bitches to get ready
Don't get gassed unless you're getting getty
Don't get jerk j-jerk don't get nutty
Fix up your paper work you're somebody
But you ain't better than the President
I'm just too eloquent, bitch, I'm the President!
I be sitting on a elephant counting all my money where Stella went
And I don't need my groove back unless the nigga looking like 2Pac
Unless he got colors like Tucan, Sam
Bet I could bake a gram like the baker's man
Stop running up on me like who? what? when?
I stay around the white like the Ku Klux Klan
I stay around the sand butter pecan tan, butter pecan tan
I stay around the sand butter pecan tan nigga

Damn, I'm a bad bitch I'mma give y'all a couple more bars it's nothin.. Listen....

I was shotgun when the Bentley cruised up
I'm a bad bitch let me put my shoes up
I don't say hi, I just throw my 2's up
When I'm in Texas I chuck my deuce up
Bitches is snakes sorta like Medusa
I get on the beats like a new producer
I'm in a GT, she in a PT Cruiser, I mean the PT bruiser
Dang lil mama you is such a loser
You is such a loser, dang lil mama you is such a loser...

I mean... If I'm not the baddest bitch who the fuck is?
I mean when I do it's done. Get who you want..
Like, I'mma body every last bitch in the game
I'mma sit on my throne and you know these bitches you know be pickin my fruit out
I want some fresh strawberries and shit tell them bitches to be ready to pick my fruit out



Ha ha, ha ha
It's your girl Nicki Minaj, bitches
Listen, y'all better buckle y'all motherfuckin' seat-belts broads
It's goin' down

Fitted down and I'm ready to play
When ya album gonna drop, bitches never could say
Say, "Fuck I look like giving birds they props?
Bitches act like they hot, but I heard they not"
How the fuck you in the game like ten years strong
You bitches still can't write ya own damn songs
You see me on the stoop man these birds just salute me
Whether I'm in the coupe or the hoopti, Duke see
I'm always with a dude, that'll off the kufi
Let him eat my coochie and cop me Pucci
House in the boonies, rock a doobie
Cock the twenty-two,then spark a loosey
He tell me I'm the one, he probably right
He pressing me like button downs on a Friday night
Your girl get it poppin' like dynamite
Dynamite, the coke albino white
Name one bitch in the game, that I can't murder
Chicken noodle bitches, on the side with a soda
Give it to everybody, like a cop with a quota
Stop playing poker hop in something mocha
Bitch want it with me? Living the life lo-ca
Oh, I get it you a joker
Leave a dot on your head, and I ain't talking bout polka
You the type, that be runnin' ya mouth
See you on the block, wanna run in ya house
I'm with that nigga Fendi, never fucks with a slouch
I fuck with dirty money, like what's under the couch
Cause ain't a bitch could fuck with my flow
When it comes to drugs, mami just say no
Either you're on something or you're S-L-O
I come, cum hard, I don't come with garbage
Just one phone call, they gon' come regardless
I always got the ball ma, I don't roll with starters
Write my own bars and my flow's the hardest, nigga

Nigga you can ask Micheal Jack. who's badder
You can lick it from the front or you can lick it from the back
When I jiggle my ass you can do your little laugh
Anyway I got a tight little honey dip
That's why these niggas get tight when honey dip
Niggas know my pussy taste like mango tango
So they put a couple karats in my ankle bangles
When my legs go back you can hear them jangle
Once you pop you can't stop like a can of Pringles
Let me grab the mic while I spit ya song, six seconds Jadakiss your on...
Uh Uh On Uh Uh On Uh Uh Uh Uh on

Doin it and doin it and doin it well
I represent Queens, he was raised down in Yonkers
I represent Queens, he was raised down in Yonkers



Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back? Swinging for that-
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy_
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

Now every club promoter, wanna bid like auctions
Cause I pack shows, sell ticks like Boston
Pat your back ho, why the fuck they coughin'?
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin', you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my strait jacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin'
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you, just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki, a target?
Just cause, this lil' piggy went to the market
Marketing steps, they marketed sex
M-Mark it with an X, they talkin' them checks now, now, now


Why did you envy? Why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
Cause now, I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money, by sun down
Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got, hotter than islands, on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos; Did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck, when that bell go "Ding!"


I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me?
Cause you thought that I would die
But I'm fine, I'm me
Don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me-e-e-e-eeeee?
Cause you thought that I would die
But I'm fine
I'm on a go, I'm on a go, yeah
But bad gyal, try to stop my flow, yeah yeah yeah
I'm fine, I'm fine





Y'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.

She does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?

Hell fucking no.



_________________________________________________________________


Absolutely. Right. Absolutely.

What you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?

Honestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.

_________________________________________________________________


Well, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.

Stupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.

Everybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.

They're gonna say, "You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle."

"Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?"

"Why don't you stand up?"

That happens to everybody, though.

It does.

No, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.

I think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.


Someone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.

Do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, "I did look like a damn fool?"

Yes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

Do you ever think that?


That's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.

_________________________________________________________________





You can! Why not?

_________________________________________________________________

Do you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?

They already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.

Who do you feel that you lean towards more?

I can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.




Right, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.



I think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.


She's winning!


_________________________________________________________________

When it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?

Oh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.

And yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...

"Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time..."

Safaree... Safaree...

_________________________________________________________________


I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.

How can the author of "I wish I could enjoy this moment for life" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?

Absolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.

Pause!


Not even that, you closed up the Grammy's.

But that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.

And then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.

_________________________________________________________________













How do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.

I'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?




_________________________________________________________________

Pay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?

We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.

A butt with lyrics

How did you get out of that?

Because I created a brand.



You the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. "I'm tired of being humble."

I'm not a cocky person by nature.

Scaff, be cocky for her!


What!? What would need to be sucked? On you?

Ay. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.

_________________________________________________________________


Thank you, darling.

Charlemange da God, singed out!

Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard

See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me

Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy
The girl she used to be
She used to be the sweetest girl

When a good girl's gone, she gone forever
And you can't make it rain, without the stormy weather
And its funny when it rains, when it rains it pours
It would've never happened, if I would've stayed in doors
Would've never happened, if I never traded in my textbooks
Cause now I'm hot, but the critics say, I'm just looks
They say I'm too sexy, they say I'm selling out
Cause when I come out niggas, get their umbrellas out
I take the L, cause I don't won't to see my brother loose
Been through it all, but I can never fill my mothers shoes
And I don't want a hand out, I just want my adlibs to get panned out
And I just wanna tell the girl, that could feel me
That I just play the card, the nigga dealt me
See, everything I been through, could've killed me
That's why there's really nothing, you could tell me
You see I live for the bill, I die for the bill
I still make sure I read, the bi to the bile
And everytime I write, I'm precise in my skill
It's more out of life. then just ice in your grill
Fuck me, blame me, fuck you, pay me
This is what you made me, where my money at?
Say you want to drape me, turned around and rape me
Now you won't mistake me, where my money at?

Where my girls at,where my girls at
If they be fronting then tell them "yo where my money at"
Where my money at
Where my-where my money at
Whe-whe-whe-whe-where my money at

Back to the thuggin', now we sippin' sizzurp
Pour it down my ass, let 'em drink it 'til he bizzurp

Extracurricular, parallel to none, I am perpendicular
Hit 'em with the, oh-now-that's-just-ridiculous!
We could've cleared up all these particulars
That could have been the homicide, vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin', up at theski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Yourwhole vibe changed, when you got that phone call
That's the effect, they call a snow ball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin' "Please come back, I have given my all!"
I have given my all
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small
I had given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for you
I'm waitin' on you, waitin' boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on you
I'm waitin' for you, waitin' boy
Could you catch me? Could you catch me?
Could you catch me? I am waitin' on you to catch me

You wanted oh so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
And maybe I should have never, taken you from her
But, with all of the aforementioned, I am still trapped, in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waitin', cause I am in need, of more attention
Could've called back, just to say somethin',I'mma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination,I'm not doing well, exclamation!
You succeeded at your attempts to make me -
Need you desperately, to vindicate me
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all,catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for you
I'm waitin' on you, waitin' boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on you
I'm waitin' for you, waitin' boy
Could you catch me? Could you catch me?
Could you catch me? I am waitin' on you to catch me

Okay!
Oh, oh, oh, okay!
Oh, oh, oh, okay!
It's, it's whatever you say, ay, ay
It's whatever you say, ay, ay
I am at your disposal

My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for you
I'm waitin' on you, waitin' boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on you
I'm waitin' for you, waitin' boy
Could you catch me? Could you catch me?
Could you catch me? I am waitin' on you to catch me

RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

The streets been telling me to get on the remix right?!
Heh heh ha ha ha ha ha ha! Let's get it!

I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is lagging
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been?
Yeah I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
Ha ha... plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki!" Asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars - sentencing
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho - punt!
Forced trauma - blunt
You play the back, bitch I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cutting it
Nicki Minaj, is who you ain't fucking with
You lil' fraggle rock, beat you with a pad lock
I am a movie, camera block
You out of work, I know it's tough
... But enough is enough

Rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon

Aiyyo somebody go get a theromostat and check my temperature
I feel like a got a fever in this muh'fucker!!!!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!

Nicki!!! How you gon' take my hot line and make it a hot song
Like I ain't 'posed to come and step on this shit like King Kong!!!
See as a child I was born with a old soul
See I would breathe heavy flame would shoot out of my nose hole
HAAAAAAAA RRRAAHHHHHH!!! Too much shitty diapers
Love to play with matches and drink all the fluid out of lighters
From when I was a child I know that most of y'all was triddash
I dig in my nose and wipe the biggest BOOGER on your bitch asssssss!!!!
Using your head like fuck what the Lord said
Slightly demented with a permanent wrinkle in my forehead
Boar's Head beef bitch if you want it then peep lane
Murder niggas with the fire then bounce to a Heat game
Tie you up like bikes to a rail in with a little cheap chain
And I'll comfortably hang you from the side of the building
So niggas see your bitch ass is LAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMEEEE!!!!
"Aiyyo what you cut it off for? Don't you see what I'm doin to this?!"
'Posed to know how I'm directing these flicks
Cause this is something that I fathered and mastered
And plastered 'til they started calling me sick bastard
I'm drastic when it comes to reminding niggas who's responsible for the classics
And I burn a hole in the street like a nigga was acid
Everytime I jump on the beat see the shit will get drastic
While you getting yo' ass kicked
Like a kick and a punch slap and two chops
Kinda like pong ping baduf baf beat him until he diggity 2Pac
Mi broke mi ting leave a few match
Pardon me UH! Shuffling the beat nigga!!!
UH! Take a elbow, I'm scuffling to eat
Like a nigga that was grinding and was hustling for weeks
So I rushed and rushed, then I blacked
Then I came through and I gave the streets crack
Controlling the functions throughout the steer
I make 'em all surrender 'til they see white flags
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Change your shitty drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this and I'll twist you to a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old stale urine
GONE!!!!

Girl I ain't gon' do it
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Nah I ain't gon' do it

He said, "Arch your back"
I ain't gon' do it
He said, "Kiss my neck"
I ain't gon' do it
Talk dirty in my ear
I ain't gon' do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
He said, "Arch your back"
I ain't gon' do it
He said, "Kiss my neck"
I ain't gon' do it
Talk dirty in my ear
I ain't gon' do it
I'ma need some fresh air, bitch

Gold in my champagne
Your shit blank, boy your shit lame
Probably just like your dick game
So I don't need to know your name
Don't you see these on my feet?
Bet you can't guess how much I paid
That's a shame
Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane

Do it for the niggas
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Do it for the niggas
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Girl I ain't gon' do it
Nah I ain't gon' do it



I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
And if you not talking money then I don’t understand your language

It's going down, down Barbie, pushing a pink Ferrari
I race through Africa just to see the safari
I am the baddest bitch in America
Slicker than a Jheri curl, just ask Erykah
The black Sarah Jessica, J-J-Jessica!
Don't be text messaging me, I never check my messages
Only thing you could ask me is how I want my sandwiches
I want more cheese, lots and lots of cheese
And when I'm on the stage I'm with SB
And when you see my luggage it says LV
And when I'm on the plane it's so empty
Hmmm, that's why all those female rappers envy

Oh, I'm sorry. Did she say something? My bad
You know, maybe I was booked. I guess I missed ya
You know, when you're booked four times a week every week, it's kinda hard to keep track of bum bitches
Oh, you do the math
It's barbie, bitch!

Yo, why these bitches in the game gettin' serious for?
I was just playin' when I said you looked liked Curious George
I mean, I was in the SL, ice on the bezel
I ain't mad at you lil' mama, you a sketel
I'm a winner, you that thing that start with a "S.L."
Rhyme with a cruiser, end with a r-ra
Yup, you're a loser, I am a super star-ah
F.A.B.O., I do it, like Toccara
Cause ya'll some dylon hoes
Tryna fuck up my band, I fuck with Nylon holes
I got the pumps and the bumps,the pumps in the trunk
In case I gotta spazz, and blast you mudda cunt
I had to laugh at that one
Bitch get outta line, I'mma slap the fat one
I'm such a maniac
Where Wayne at? I'm tryna get some, brainiac
I gets down, like when niggas is shootin'
Mami, I style wild, like when niggas is lootin'
Hoes is mad, cause these hoes is losin'
They do a lot of walkin', I do alot of cruisin'
Put the top in the back of trunk
Take off a shoe, slap a bitch with the back of the pump
I ain't never had a problem giving bitches the business
Pop bitches in the eye, like I finished my spinach
I'm a New York broad, spend chips in the village
Hopped out the yellow cab, oops, the yellow Jaguar
Girls don't like me, guess it's the swagger
Don't talk to me 'bout, chicks got skills
She's alright, but she's not real
Listen big homie, I'm that deal
I say I body bitches, mean that bitch got killed
Riding the baseline, like I'm 'Quil O'Neal

Now how many bitches do it take to knock me down
You know bitches gon' hate
But I don't give a fuck who you bodied on tape
I'm into movin' weight mami in and out of state
Let's get it now



As I sit back relax crack jokes for a mintue
I think about the up-and-comers that could probably get it

I might go to jail for fuckin with Hell Rell
If he get ill and pull on my ponytails
I heard Maino life is like a movie
Set up the cameras fuck him in the jacuzzi
Freaky Zeke that should be easy
He just came home I know he wanna bone
But what about JR Writer, I'mma skill him
And when I r-r-ride him, I'mma grill him
The nigga Pap he might could fuck me
But I ain't tryna Be drip Drippin a Gino green
Tell Stacks to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him would he would he yell squad up!
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy
Throw some d's on it & im might breathe on it
& when Im Philly I gotta Fuck Gillie
Snacth his big max & slap a bitch silly

Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'

Put it in half way, Red Cafe
Put the pussy on his freckles, haha that tickles
Uncle Murda could bring the handcuffs
Why is that, I gotta watch out gotta get a rough neck
As for Gravy he might could beat
You know them fat niggas love to eat
And when I want a Nicki Minaj who could it be
It's them Young Gunnaz, Chris and Lil' Neef
"Nicki what about Fendi? He made you pop"
Tell him to kick rocks, or give me some top
I'm on my way to Jer', to break Ransom off
Quench his thirst, when my pants come off
Murda Mook & Miles gone have to battle
Scoop whoever win and, tell him to sca-dattle
Run up on Mims, he could give me backshots
This is why, this is why, this why I'm hot

Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin, but I'm sayin'



I done put sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm DMC like run
Listen mammi I'm the muhfuckin one

You don't like me you just like my flow
Just booked a show but I might not go
Nigga said he didn't have a pole for my ho
Damn why a nigga tryna fuck up my dough?

When it come to me every light say go
They tell me to stop but I'm like hell no
Now everybody watch my M.O
Nicki been hot since you rock shell tops
Yessir

Ha ha ha ha
Gotta laugh at that
Bitch give me the ball I'm a pass it back
Spit nothin but crack got bags of that
When it come to rap I master that


You can spot me from a mile away
Nicki sexy any time of day
Word on the street is that I'm chinese
No lil mama I'm just high off haze

Don't fuck a dude if a dude don't pay
Don't suck a dude if a dude dirty
When it come to you gotta look purty
Sit up in the booth get your weave curly, hey

Sim simma
Pass me the keys to my beemer
Wish I had a booty like Trina
Nigga get your green up
Stay in the sky like Nina
Flights to Japan, Tiran and Korea


I gotta laugh at these bitches
These bitches can't be serious!



Thank you
Thank you for comin' out tonight
Ladies and gentlemen
I am the president of Dirty Money Records
New York City

Who you know fresher than Nick? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn,  but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go "Ew"?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need y'all to roar
It's my time I need y'all to  roar
After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night?
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind?
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

Can I get an encore
I know you want more
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar




Poom Poom!
I'm 5′4,  double R, zoom zoom
I don’t give a fuck about ya, Looney Tune goons
Yelling boom boom, when your really poon-poon
I'm Nicki, I'm finicky, I’m picky
I stay around the six like that little mouse, Mickey
Ask Rocko, ask Gucci… ask Gucci, Gucci Bandana
I'mma star, I'm the Black Hannah Montana
I’m such a girl, I’m such a girly girl
I'm sippin' on my milkshake, with this swirly swirl
Excuse me mister, put some cherries in my cups
I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts!
The boys goes nuts, the boys-boys goes nuts
My nigga S. Bezzy, keep my wrist breezy
Why would I go hard, when this shit is so easy?



I don't wanna sound mad, though! I don't wanna sound mad!
I feel marvelous right now!
Dirty money!

Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown
She won 3 rounds, I'mma need a hundred thou
Like china town, bitches better bow down
Oh, you ain't know? bet ya'll bitches know now
Fuck I gotta do to let 'em know that I'm the one?
Way I ride the drum they salute me in the slum
In the 6 hun the color of bubble gum
Yes, sir, look what i've done
They r-run, run when I come
Bum-stickity-bum, let me tell 'em where I'm from

Made a mood and get my niggas out the hood
Same place where Murda Mace once stood
Ferrari cars, interior all wood
Now I'm in the club, bottles on me
Louis Vuitton fits on me
Heavy chains, nothin' hollow on me
I'm a star now, all the problems on me
Shawty lookin' nice so I'm lovin' her
I don't care what you say, I'm cuffin' her
She's hot, nigga can't get enough of her
Drinkin' champagne, I can't stop touchin' her
Her pretty eyes is killin' me
Her glossy lips is stealin' me
After the club ma, we can chill in the V

Game locked down, I'm the nigga with the key
I see your girl, she's so fly
She's got wings, see her float by
Whole crew sick, hottest things out
Street fitted in bring 'em out, bring 'em out
L.V. on the shoulder
She look right in the Rover
In the club, never sober
Ballers, we the niggas on the posters
Rockstar, so Sunny Bono
Cowboy, so Tony Romo
Shake down shawty, that's the logo
Feel free, fuck the po-po

Hopped off the boat, I am such an immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament?
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fishermen
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelins
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist looking like like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mommy you bad but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up, go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad

You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free

I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shawty lookin' at me cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all cause I got life
I feel free



There’s a bad bunch of bitches rolling with me on my side
I know I gotta choose em when bitches look me in my eyes
Wordplay so sick, I can change ?
Hit them with this pimpin now you feeling like it's the first time
I’m talking real real pimpin man
I’m talking real real pimpin man
I’m talking real real pimpin man

I heard you was the beach and I’m looking to get wet
You fucking with the keys and I play the clarinet
I guess you musta heard I’m the baddest bitch around
So it is going down like a mother fucking frown
And this is going up when you see me in my skirt
When they see me, they go uhh, leave them bitches in the dirt
When they see me they go ohh yeah bitch there puts in work
I’mma make that pussy squirt
If you want it, come and get it, you can have it for dessert
You can eat it with some cherries like you eating Ben and Jerry’s
And uh uh, this is’nt scary this is very necessary




Chin checker, chin checker
Chin checker, I'm the chin checker, nigga

It was a quarter past 3 when I ran into Rells
Didn't forget my keys, but my name ring bells
A little white tee, some Adidas with the shells
Turn in the coupe, oh shoot, broke a nail
Lemme lemme think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22?
Cause if a bird try to get out of the cage
One bitch down, New York Times front page
I went to Starbucks, I wanted to get a frappe
Then had a Snapple, apple with the capple
That's Fendi, but that's irrelevant
Threw him a couple Benjis, now I'm the president
I'm Nicki, finicky, so picky
Slick like Ricky, flow be so icky
Now class is finished, you'll be home 'bout 3
Tell all them rap bitches whatchu know 'bout me, nigga

Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

Got some nice titties, yes, they wild pretty
That's how I got the S, the five-fifty
That's cause I get, I get, I get busy
I'm badder than the dude at the Neverland
In the money green coupe with the Leprechaun
Holler at him, get a four-leaf-clover
Go a- go against me, guaranteed you're over
Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan—
Trum-trum-trum, you slowpoke
Better rum, rum, rum a little coke
And-a S-M-I-the-L-E
And ain't one thing them could tell me
Cause I write, write, write my own shit
I'm the one, like I'm the culprit, nigga

Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know' bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me
Whatchu know 'bout me, whatchu, whatchu know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me



Lemme tell a lil' story, about this dude I knew, he said -
Used to go to school out in L.I.U, he said -
He'd make me a bet, he'd own his own jet, and he'd
Show me the city,from a bird's eye view, said he -
Came from Jamaica, he had a lil' paper
He owned a couple acres, and then I caught the vapors
That's how we got together, on the bike -
Wine and dine me,dom and sex and we be -
Arm and armor, 'Mani dress and see I ain't need
A leprechaun, or four leaf clover, I just -
Woke up one morning,and he copped the Rover, see? -
I knew about them girls, he had back then, but -
I was getting money, I ain't care bout them, cause -
They was getting G's, I had M's, I used to -
Split my dividends, with all my friends, cause -
I was in the lounge, they was in the Greyhound, like -
In and out of town,moving coke by the pound, like
Guess it didn't sound right, cause them bitches was mad -
Started plotting, trying to get what I had, see -
My homegirl Teisha, said that Keisha with the  -
Real black lips, used to smoke that reefer, some -
Bitch, named Dawn, used to fuck LaiQwan and
Alicia with the chinky eyes, used to be with freaky Ty
Lived across the street, from this nigga named Tiki Diamond
Yeah, chicken noodle bitches, like a pack of Ramen
They had it out for me, kidnapped my brother
At the rucker, cause he used to put it down for me

Oh my God, they caught Brandon, I got his picture in the mail
He was rocking a Vanson, the note said
"Bitch, we got surveillance on the mansion and we gonna need thirty million for the ransom"


To be continued...



This is for my niggas that did bids
All of my niggas thats doin time for some shit that they ain't did

And I'm askin am I, ready for the rapture?
See, I'm just a little girl, caught in a mixed up world
Shoutout my girls, that be callin me sista girl

For all of my men's that's locked in the pens, and trapped in the silence

Chorus
Where my straight jacket at, I’m a psycho
Where that white blow?, Why they copy my flow?
If it’s not Young Money, it’s a typo
There them lights go, we don’t talk to five-o

We don’t t-t-talk, talk to five-O
There them lights go, we don’t talk to five-o
If it’s not Young Money, it’s a typo
There them lights go, we don’t talk to five-o

Jae Millz
Mister officer, mister officer
I’m sorry I don’t wanna take a walk with ya
Matter of fact, I ain’t try'na talk to ya
We ain’t got no business, so what we talking for?
There ain’t no need to bring me in for no interrogation
Cause about that boy who just got shot, I gots no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving
At the precinct writing statements on which trap house is the station {​DAMN}​
Not I, tattle-telling is for homos
Besides, thats the Number 1 Young Money no-no
Police, we don’t chat with them
We ain’t got no rap for them
You in the cop car pointing niggas out from the back of them {​THERE HE GO}​
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I’m black, then you's a fucking goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the halfway house and ask your supervisor

Chorus

Nicki Minaj
Yo… 4, 3, 2
Cocka doodle do
I was out in Africa, Shaka Zulu crew
Ho ho ho, red stockings too
Coming down the chimney, you're chopped n' screwed
It’s me bitches, eff you snitches, gimmie the heebie jeebies
Lemme get that brewski, niggas know them bitches can’t do it like I dooski
I just pull up, chuck the deuce in some blue denim, and I just heard he running with the lieutenant
I’m the mistress, I be in the District of Columbia
Yes uh huh, Washington
Better ask around, cause I’m what's popping-ton
I’m who they think about, playing with they pee pee
Gotta count sheep b, cause I’m never sleepy
Yes, I’m the chief, you can find me in my teepee… BITCHES!

Chorus

Gudda Gudda
Young Money psycho, straitjacket on me
Break a nigga jaw if he turn to informant
I bring it to your door step, loose lips sink ships nigga
I hear you preaching like a fucking reverend
Should've killed you in the first place, no second guessing
Could've killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect em
I could AK attack em
You looking at a gangster in his essence
Now bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence
Cause I’m God’s gift like a present
For one don’t try me I could give you two lessons
You peasants get murdered if you do test 'em
Gudda Gudda biatch!

Chorus



Baby boy, you must got Nicki twisted
I would've left, before but you insisted
Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core, I gotta leave you
How could you love me, and humiliate me?
You ain't my man, don't affiliate me
With all your plans cause you really made me -
A lil' bitch, when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days, from -
The slum to the runway, runs in the Hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money, it was gun play
Used to tell me to listen, to what a thug say
At night, I would sleep on you
And I guess I did sleep on you
Cause when they said it, I said "Creep on who?"
No, not myboo,ain't what he gon do

Oh now you wanna be with me
But you can't be with me
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life
You shoulda treated me right
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go

Why you saying you ain't feel her? You was in  -
The villa, she was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin' on a Miller, my bitch -
Pam' had the hidden cam, like Killa
Funny how ya win some, ya lose some
Never worry where your income, would come from
Cause no matter, where you was I held you down
Up north, to uptown, so how you sound
Now you all up in my face, 'bout you make mistakes
If I'da known you was fake, I'da laced your steak
Quit lying, why you lying? I watched the tape, nigga
Now get up out my dressing room, give me some f'ing room
Go get your mind right, and take it as a lesson learned
Just like Usher nigga, you gon' have to, let it burn
To the left, and I ain't talkin about Jigga girl

Oh now you wanna be with me
But you can't be with me
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life
You shoulda treated me right
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go



Just when they thought I was done for the summer
Came out the cupboard, show my ass like a plumber
I ain't Chinese, but you're worth two dolla'
Tee get the bleach, I'm a show my true ca-la
Tell a nigga holla in the peach Impala
Only if he give good brain like a scholar
A-la, a-la, a-la eyy!
Knock your top off like a holiday
Dang, little mama, I should be in your pot
Cause everywhere I go they saying Nicki you're hot
I catch more eyes than the letter with the dot
Super-size fries, my pies better be hot
She got it twisted like a cock-eyed bitch
That's why I be in Mr.Chows, you a Popeye's bitch
You the type to get some money, go spend it on some boots
Save just enough for some douche for your cooch'
It ain't about money, you ain't speakin' my lang'
Cuttin' any bitch off if she enter my lane
And it really ain't a thang, when I bang, I bang
And my goons swing by like orangutans
Fuck wrong with you? I am the Don-dada
I show you how to do it, like I'm your mo-mother
You can't beat me, so don't do-don't bother
You soft like butter,and no, I don't stutter
You Romeo and I'm Master P
I'm the up and comin' that the streets talk about
The twenty-two slugga, make a bitch walk it out
Nicki get it poppin' like I came unannounced
Stay with a goon and my goon dumbin' out
So, first thing first, I'm the queen of the crew
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew
Beef stew, beef stew, whatcha gonna do?
I could cook crack, or cook a mean beef stew
Beef stew, beef stew, whatcha gonna do?
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew

I am the president, I am the president

Get a couple beats from my nigga Doe Beezy
Why would I go hard, when this shit is so easy

But really, I don't know why I'm posted at the bar
Ya bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar

And pop bottles with my team, Young Money till the death of me

I mean we can't even rock them shoes if it dont got a comma on the pricetag
You know, I mean but then again, who looks at the pricetag you know



We like them boyz, with them rubber band bands
He move weight, keep a couple gram grams

Flip that money, make it do a handstand

Where are my bands, where my "Rubber Band Mans"?

It's official, bang your pistols
Play your money it's funny, I mean it tickles
I need a D-boy, I need a president
And if you're spending them stacks, I need some evidence
Then you can bring out all them cars, that they rap about
Then I'm a let you eat it, like I put the snacks out
Don't say you can't, say you can, say you can can
Flip that money, flip it like a handstand


He's a banker by nature and he'll call and
Stick up the debt, that you owe and thank ya
He'll switch the toys out, never the same route
But niggas acting, like they ain't about to pay out
Taking me out, just to ask how my day went

Cause I know, you want to smash, like a crash dummy




Chea, Nicki Minaj
Dirty Money, Young Money
Yo, why the fuck these little bitches always talking shit about what they did and...?
I don't give a fuck, bitch!
Nicki Lewinsky

When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
"Nick-Nack, Carry Crack", what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

You know, I'mma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and, and... send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talking 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine!

Time machine bitches always talkin' about the old days
When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJ's
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they getting drop-dropped, like a couple cars
Late Night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your gar-bage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

See, see, you see Anna Mae?
I'm about to slap ya'll bitches 'round and call ya'll Anna Mae
Like, that, that's what y'all gon' get in a minute, real talk, like
Cause, you know, this is '08 now, like

You know, you know, you know, call-- all bets are off, bitches
You know, game just begun

Niggas wanna book me, but they ain’t spendin’ no guap
That’s why, I pull up to the curb, like fuck's the word?
You know, I keep the twenty-two tucked, in the girdle
Had to leak one of my bitches off, “Throop and Myrtle”
Put the shells to your back, now they callin' you turtle
See, if you wanna laugh, you can laugh, but nigga
Get my money, get my cash, get my math, see everything’s
Funny 'til that ass gettin' trashed, I'm getting dirty
Money, like my stash need a bath, see boys?
If it don’t make cents, then it don’t make dollars
When broke niggas holla, I just pop my collars
The dope boys get it, yeah, the dope boys cool
But, the white boys say, they be like, "Nicki’s rules!"
Like, you got money, 'cause you’re sittin' on dubs
Where your company, nigga where your pay stubs?
Look I'm on the grind and I'm lookin' for the grub
Fifty in the club, and we lookin' for the bub
Talkin' 'bout you wanna enjoy me, first you gon’
Need to get a couple employees, get it?
Get your money right, get your money right, right?
Then you can bite, you know this something tight, tight
You know I smoke bitches, I'mma need a light, light

I get money, money I got

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at her butt

Just got a collect call from Hector, I was on the phone
Outside of my double decker, Margiela umbrella
Pop trunk in stormy weather, on who? Cinderella
Lobster for breakfast, necklace playin' checkers
Hold up that wrist, her thong red licorice
Codeine dreams, I lean like Stojaković
I ain't top 5? What the H-E-double hockey sticks?
My left hand was an avalanche
My right hand, uh, 8 grand, finna traffic jam
Doors locked, hundred K on the Porsche box
My socks, got glow-in-the-dark rocks
LA Leakers, bustin' out the speakers
Keep your mouth closed when JODY HiGHROLLER speakin'
Ass cheeks like two volleyballs
Neon spandex turnin' heads at the damn mall
I'll lay down 'fore I lift off
In this Lamborghini plane, seats sure are super soft


Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back

Why’d you have to leave in July
On a peaceful and serene Summer night
I wish that you would've waited until September
Just a couple more memories to remember
I guess I have to pay you back to your lender
I guess I have to send you back to the sender
But then again maybe you're gone til November
And maybe this is just part of the agenda

Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

Why couldn’t you come right home
When you seen the text message in your phone
I should have put my pride aside to come and find you
I could've told you about the niggas that's behind you
Could have told you all about my intuition
I could have even bought the extra ammunition
But now you moved on so fuck you
Should’ve known from day one I couldn’t trust you

Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

Why would they take you from me
Why the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding
If you in a better place, then you’re free
Well then, why can’t they make me believe it
You said that you will leave these streets
And I know you didn’t mean in a body bag
But now you see you not bulletproof
And I’m mad cause
You’re the best that I’ve ever had

Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

I’ll never love again
I’ll never love again
I’ll never, I’ll never
I’ll never love again
What would you suggest that I do now
Why’d you leave
I hate you



I guess I'm wrong for thinking that I could trust you
For never holding all of that shit against you
But now I’m strapped with my .45 special
I’m so special, so special, so special
Nigga, you softer than a homosexual
And I am so extraterrestrial
So you can keep my things
There's nothing you can bring
And you can have my ring, you can add it to your bling
Cause I’m okay and I’m still a G
Pray for my enemies, my name’s still Nicki
In time you’ll change, but time don’t freeze
You better leave before you get wetter than Pisces



Okay
How you gon' tell me I'm not the best
That came out the West? Um, I mean the East, see
I'm the president, but I don't live in D.C
I rep the NY, FYI, I said I rep the NY, FYI
I get them pies to them guys that say, "¡ay, ay, ay!"
I'm the head honcho, get work from papi
And dead Pancho, put him in the roncho
I mean Range Rov' where we let them things go
I only fuck with dudes that could let their chain show
Think you can beat me, then you're azy-cray
Body bitches, have them pushing up aisies-day
I'm such a psycho, niggas call me Michael
Nicki been hot, since you was on your tricycle
Bitches, Romans, countrymen
You salute the president with your country friend
And you softer than them dudes, with their wrist-es bent
I am the president, where my podium?
Is it because my flow slicker than petroleum?
See, I'm that yellow bus girl
They say "Nicki, you the best!", and I tell them "Uh, dur!"
You tell me what I know, I guess I must concur
'Cause everybody hate when you're great and you're caking
But they gon' get it all wrong
Fucking with them fake thugs and them fake Don Juans
Tell that nigga womp womp
Cause you ain't getting chips unless you count then Bon Tons

How the only chips you got is Bon Ton potato chips?
Like, that's what I don't understand, I try to tell these niggas, like, you can't be serious
I'm Nicki Minaj!
Other than that, like, if you can't see I'm the best
I mean really, you know, these bitches so washed up
I'm walking around with them dryer sheets
Like, you know, the sheets you throw in the dryer
Yeah, I'm walking around with them sheets now
Cause, like, when I see these washed up ass bitches
I'm just throwing them on bitches like, real talk, like
I'm just throwing them on bitches like
Bitch, hit the dryer, you washed!
Dirty Money



She's so pretty, she know they want her, but -
She's so sididdy, they can't afford her,  but -
All the boys stare, when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway, head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights, beam bright, got the best boobs
We hit a couple malls, then the Ramada
Cause on the road of life, she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter, than a coke bottle
She super charge cars, anything for Minaj
And she could only park, in the superstar garage
Cause she-she-she-she bad, if anybody ask
Her bags is boss, cause her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer, tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch, named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her, she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton

I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I-love my Range Rover

She's so dope, you know she even help me -
Transport the dope, that mama stay around that -
White, like the pope, they get the canine, but they -
Can't smell the coke, now you tell me why is it
Now you tell me why is it, don't need the Riker's visit
That is because, I'm about the color, of the Geico lizard
She L-Lewinsky, hold ya bosses-es
Come around town, three hundred horses-es
Power she devour, got them gettin' divorces-es
And now we hit hydraulics, that's for the left turn
Need I repeat, she got more horses, than a Western
You know she beat weight, so she don't eat late
A vegetarian, she sipping on that V-eight
They try to gas her, they try to put it in her
You can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner
Her lip gloss poppin', we call it Armor All
We chuck the deuces up, d-d-don't know all of y'all

I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I-love my Range Rover
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover

Sit up in the Rolls maybe, roll to my residence
Stay around Fendi,, he love my spaghetti

I guess he did already, guess I'm a little bitter
Cause I show bitches how to do it, like they baby sitter
So where my cash at? And where my stash at??
I mean, where the Dow Jones, where the Nas-Daq?
I do it for the little macs, with their caps back
My little niggas pumpin' crack, out they napsack
Know what I mean? Get the sticky cream, pass that
I smoke bitches, can't nicotine patch that
Don't need your spot, to get a good game
Cause a shot is a shot, if you got a good aim

It's been a long time coming, but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when your fame

We on the road to riches, I'm fucking loads of bitches

My little golden mistress, for her, I load them biscuits

It's been a long time coming, but you don't know specifics
No more phony wishes, we ready, cause now we know the business
Come holla at your guy, I always make it pour
Invite me to ya wedding, I throw dollars at the bride
It's dirty money, dirty jeans, and dirty scullies
You heard he funny, but chill, I'm still absurdly gully
Most of these rappers lost, it's no cash at all
If I knew this back then, I'da just played basketball
Or maybe not, they say that I never pass the ball
If there's no cash involved, baby I'mma laugh it off

Okay. Okay. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. I don't think ya'll understand what I'm about to do, I'm 'bout to master these bitches, man. Chea! Chin checker

I used to dilly dally, now I dilly to Cali
Used to push a pink Denali, now it's Chevy Impalis
I used to be broker than them niggas in alleys
Now I get my work it out like Biggity-Bally
I used to go hard, used to cock the brim
Used to take the dollar car, used to shop at Vim
Now I take it real easy, the hood believe me
I don't mean Cover Girl when I say "easy breezy."
Jiminy Cricket, let the master in
When it come to bad bitches, I'm the last of kin
I'm bringing S-E-X-Y B-A-C-K
If Nicki ain't the best, suck a D-I-C-K
I'm Young Nicholas, my style ridiculous
I heard your money funny, and mommy, I'm ticklish
I gotta laugh. I gotta laugh at it
I always got crack, I guess I'm a crack addict


I used to make a dollar stretch like a Pilate
Now I gotta play the potty in Giuseppe Zanotti
Gotta push the Maserati, candy paint on the body
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby
Look, I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time
And you can't duplicate it, I'm a one-of-a-kind
Do what I do it, like I do it for the T.V
Bitches must be blind, cause these bitches can't see me
Do it all for GP, tell 'em to suck a pee-pee
Monday, LA, Tuesday, I'm in DC
Get a ticket, or you only get a snippet
If you write your lyrics,  little mama, I can dig it
I show you how to do it, what I do is really magic
Abracadab' tricks are for kids, silly rabbit




And so I pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean
I hope you...

Fuck you I hate you
Bitch I made you
I got a new bitch and you mad cause she ain't you
You url cause you make me sick and I hope whoever you kissed now you sucked my dick and I bust in ya mouth so you had my cum in it

Lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow


I hope your fire, Fire burns baby
I hope your fire, Fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow

Passing on you
I said I'm passing on you cause I'm sitting here thinking bout
Fuck it since you want to leave imma let you but like Trina said I wish I never met you

Fire, Fire burns baby
I hope your fire, Fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told



Think I'm playing! This shit is a fucking joke!
This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke?
Say one more disrespectful thing to me.
Say one more disrespectful thing to me --
I'll go up against your head!

Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out.

I am not being disrespectful.

Up against your head!
Up against your head

Don’t tell me I'm insecure, don’t tell me I'm inadequate,
Don’t- You done came on idol feeling unsure, feeling inadequate.
You’re the insecure one sitting up there running down her resume every five minutes.

Every time you take a shot at me I'mma take it back,
And if you gotta fucking problem then handle it.

I told them, I'm not fucking putting up with your fucking highness over there
Figure it the fuck out. Figure it out.

Why, why...

Figure it out.

... do I have a 3-year-old sitting around me?

I’m not sitting here for 20 minutes
And having you run down your resume everyday.
No! Goodbye!

Listen... I can’t see my kids because you decided to make...
To have ... to have a little baby fit and going all around the stage.

Good, well then go see them now, go see them now.
You’re boring as fuck! You’re boring as fuck!









And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd

Slut don't touch me or hug me
I'm mad and I pity any girl who gets with me tonight

You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin

All you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?

And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn’t see it in her

Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high siddity
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in, whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don’t come to the hood?
How they turn they nose up like they don’t come from the hood?
Most of them be in sight til it’s time to pitch in
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich, I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can’t do no more

I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses
When I’m granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block getting screwed by the cops
Cutting school, gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They’ll break in your door
Might break in your jaw
They’ll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain’t know
They airborne for stardom
With the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin’
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant
Air Force, the Army, Air Force and Army
Fatigues is on him, no heats is on him
Cause grandmama prayed, that he’d leave the corner

I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams, got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire 23′s on my tire
Shout outs to my brothers, Jelani and Macaiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas, that be huggin’ the block
Two Times for my niggas, that be ducking the cops
Three Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Stushing they own ride, bitches they don't lie
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
Look, I see you without a man ma, you raised ya son
Well look, when you blow up everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up

I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams, got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big big big money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
One in my purse, cause I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm fly as hell, I got him thirsty, track-n-field
I'm on some dumb shi...
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and check him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

I'm on some dumb shi...
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and check him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like

Step to these broads like a Kappa do
Boo, You sold a million, now you half of who?
Get off my dick, kick it bitch












Yo... yo, yo yo yo, hold the doe
Let me get up on the floor like Mardi Gras
Like every time I rhyme I sun the shine
Lil mama, you a bird like you done some time
Every, every time I spit it's a massacre

Everyone want a dime, I'm, I'm the best
When I get up in the club I grind the best
You don't know, you better respect me
I am the one, like Tracy McGrady
Now little daddy let me, let me upgrade ya

I'm in the good car, always with a hood star
Introducing Mr. & Mrs. Good Bar

Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin Dirty Money figures, throw it up
Get up on my level bitches, get it up
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup

Take a seat, when you here me like Rosa Parks
Fuck the chit chat
Let's talk guns & drugs, you with that?
Tryin' to see a mill or two, fuck who I'm better than
Rollin up on a dutch, you know I need my medicine
It's high noon & I'm the nigga that shot the sheriff
Me & Nicki's like Bonnie & Clyde, don't be embarrassed
I'm sort of like a rabbit the way I love my cabbage
But I Still watch for 5-0 like I'm Garret
08′ Challenger lookin' like Dukes of Hazzard
Turn it into a coupe, and now the roofs gone
Word to Nicki Minaj with daisy dukes on
See it's Max-a-millie-on, chumps so move on
Before I act like a auto-bot and transform
Too Hot & I ain't Mims

He the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep his wave on swim
Wa wa waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cuz I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays me
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby


Find me in the dark

Find me in your heart

Okay so I'm gonna just, you know, briefly run down my shoutouts
Shoutout to all of the DJs that's ever showed Nicki Minaj love
I love you right back
Shoutout to DJ Holiday, um, you know
Just 'cause he has really nice eyes
And, you know, he's really sexy and all that
Um, shout out to my baby Big Mike and Trapaholics
And Sticks Malone and DJ Infamous and DJ Drama
Um, I also have a very crazy manager
Her name is Debra Antney
And um, she's psychotic, she's bipolar, um
But nevertheless she's mine, all mine
Oh, I have to share her with Gucci Mane
And I have to share her with, OJ Juice
And I have to share her with the So Icey boys
And, you know, Waka Flocka Flame and all that but
You know she's all mine, anyway




Yo, young money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich I could buy you
Kill bitches leave their body in a bayou
More brain than a IQ
And my bank account ain’t hardly empty
That’s why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who’s next to go
My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but This is it!
B- b- b- boo I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy mama you was never there!
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn’t even dare to be
So that's all folks, badibadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, need more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, "It's all yours!"
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king



Full lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!



Dopeman please can I have another hit
Dopeman Dopeman Dopeman Dopeman
Ayo, once upon a time there lived a little bad bitch
I just press the buttons on my little gadgets
Born in December so I am a Sagit
Tarius, maybe just a little Bi-curious
Yo, miney-mo-to-eenie-meenie
Your wish is my command
I mean I really, really mean it
Cause I am the lady that was on "I Dream Of Genie"
They call it spaghetti but I call it ling-uini
Coke fizzles if you wanna get the sniffles
I got that wet-wet it could get wetter than a drizzle
Plus I got plenty, no seeds in my twenty
And I just got them peanut butter crack sandwiches
You need a dopeman, Oh you need a snowman
I got that Lohan, weight like Rosanne
But f*ckin' with my money is a no-no man
I got them Bar-billions, they call me Cole-man
Dopeman please can I have another hit
Dopeman please can I have another hit
Dopeman please can I have another hit
Gang Records)
Dopeman please can I have another hit
Dopeman Dopeman Dopeman Dopeman



You know, a lot of people ask me why I feel that, you know, I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And I don’t know, people seem to be under the impression that I’ve made it to this point fast
And, you know, obviously for me, I don’t feel like that
'Cause it's me, you know? I feel like I’ve been doing it for ten billion years
But every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for getting me this far
'Cause sometimes you don’t realize how far you’ve gotten
Until you look around and look at the people who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that no matter what, in the end, it's not going to be about my talent, you know?
It's not going to be about connections
It’s not gonna be about my looks
It's gonna be about who wants it the most
And I want it the most



You're trying to tell me you're saying goodbye
I'm watching you leaving not believing my eyes
You'd better be looking over your shoulder
Cause I know too much for this to be over
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it
What once was good is gone like innocence we watched it dying
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it, can't hide it
Let it go...
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it, let it go...
I always hoped that this would last forever
Just you and me against the world
What once was powerful has weakened now we can't pretend
What once was right is wrong like everything this game must end
Oh baby, the lies and deception
We're gonna bring each other down
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it
I told you, told you, let it go



It's been 7 days of constant rain
I miss you, oh I miss you
Feeling swept away there's no barricade without you
What can I do

And everything protecting me has all been stripped away

Cuz I'm....

Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

I could try to change
But nothing fits the way that
You do, oh yeah you do
From every strangers eyes you're my best diguise
I need you
I still need you

And everything that comforts me has all been stripped away

Cuz I'm...

Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

The moments we share are all that I wear
It's colde without you
Now I have to try to get through another night

Cuz I feel...

Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked

When you come to the city
You don't act hassadiddy
You be all on the block
Or posted up in the drop
And everybody get a band
Whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up
And don't come to the hood
How they turn their nose up
Like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight
'Til it's time for picture
That's why everything
They write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bugs
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid
That can't do no more


This is for my lil homies
That be asking for kisses
When I'm granting their wishes
They be passing they digits
Carry up on the block
Getting screwed by the cop
Cutting school, getting off
Whether they like it or not
They'll break in your dough
Might break in your joe
They'll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know
They airborne for start
With the ball in the gutter
They can't turn no dodge
No matter the squadron
Lieutenant or sergent
Air force the army
Air force in army
Four teets is on 'em
No heat is on 'em
'Cause grandmama prayed
That he leave the corner


I remember when I lost
Everything in a fire
And now I got fire
23s on my tire
Shoutout to my brothers
Jelani and Micaiah
Thanks to the Messiah
My money getting higher
One time for my niggas
That be hugging the block
Two times for my niggas
That be ducking the cop
Three times for my girls
That pushing they own ride
Specially they own life
Bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad
When I blaze the gun
I see you without a man
May I raise your son
But look, when you blow up
Everybody gon' shut up
This goes out to everybody
On the come up

You let me hide
Defend my honor
Protect my pride

The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater

You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money
Just get my weight up

Know when I'm lying
Know when I'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science

Why am I trying?
No, you ain't buying
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance

You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at you
And getting at you

Picking up dishes
Throwing them at you
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit

Could you see through me?

'Cause you say "Nicki."
And I say "Who, me?"
And you say "No, you."
And I say "Screw you."

Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And I start crying
And I start screaming
The heavy breathing
But what's the reason

Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually fronting
I'm askin' you something
Yo, answer this question
Class is in session

Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind
Capture my soul
Okay, you're right
Just let it go

Okay, you got it
It's in the can
Before I played it
You knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

You see right through me
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit

How do you

Let his momma pick it up
Might back up on 'em
Vroom-vroom, with the pickup truck
That blue and yellow
Yeah that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave 'em
Hit him with that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up
Like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like M&M's in a yellow bag



As I sit back, relax, crack jokes for a minute
I think about the up and comers that could probably get it

{Verse 1}
I might go to jail for fuckin' with Hell Rell
If he get ill and pull on my ponytails
I heard Mano life is like a movie
Set up the cameras fuck him in the jacuzzi
Freaky Zeke that should be easy
He just came home I know he wanna bone
But what about J.R Writer, I'mma Skill Him
& when I ra ra ride him I'mma grill him
The nigga Pap he might go fuck me
But I ain't tryna Be drip drippin' a Gino green
Tell stacks to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him would he would he yell squad up!
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy
Throw some Ds on it & I might breathe on it
And when I'm Philly I gotta fuck Gilly
Snatch his big mac and slap a bitch silly

{hook}4x
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin' but I'm sayin'

{Verse 2}
Put it in half way Red Cafe
Put the pussy on his freckles
Haha that tickles
Uncle Murda could bring the handcuffs
Why is that,I gotta watch out gotta get a rough neck
As for Gravy he might could beat
You know them fat niggas love to eat
And when I want a Nicki Minaj who could it be
It's them Yung Gunaz Chris & Lil Neefe
Nicki what about Fendi he made you pop
Tell him to kick rocks or give me some top
I'm on my way to jers to break Ransom off
Quench his thirst when my pants come off
Murda Mook & Miles gone have to battle
Scoop whoever win & tell him to scadattle
Run up on Mims he could give me backshots
This is why, this is why, this why I'm hot, nigga

{Hook}4x
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude
I'm just playin' but I'm sayin'

Single for the night, tryna double my fun
So whats up, to the bad bitch

And her hair long, I'mma grab it

Lemme know, whats up with us

When a good girl gone, she gone forever
See yu can't make it rain without the stormy weather
And its funny when it rains, when it rains it pours
Would of never happened if I stayed indoors
Would of never happened if I never traded in my textbooks
Cuz now Im hot but all the credits say its just looks
They say Im too sexy and say Im sellin out
Cuz when I come out niggas get they umbrellas out
I take the L cuz I dont want to see my brother lose
Been through it all but I could never fill my mothers shoes
And nahh I dont want no hand out, I just want my ad lips to get paned out
And I just wanna tell the girls that could feel me, That I just play the cards the nigga dealed me
See everything I been through could of killed me

That why I really ain't nothin, yu could tell me
Yu see I live for the bill, I die for the bill
And I still make sure I read the bi to the bill
And every time I write Im persist in my skill
Its more outta life then just ice in ya grill
Fuck me lay me, Fuck yu pay me, This is what yu made me
Said yu want to drape me, turned around and raped me, Now yu ain't mistake me

Where my girls at, where my girls at



On top, we gettin' this paper
On top, we gettin' this paper
On top, we gettin' this paper

Yo, shots left and right

She said, "Baby

She caught my face like a Kodak, I couldn't shake the weather
Storm had nothing on this chick named Heather
Damn every time I seen her, it was just the thought of break up
But you know niggas and girls how they quit, then they make up

She told me she been in love with me ever since we were in 6th grade

And I just heard that you was back on the market
Let me stick shift, ride it, back it up, and then park it

Body belong on the cover of the 2010 swimsuit issue of SI
She told me to don't leave her until I know I'da got over the whole fever
And I can't stop

Best believe me she gon' get it all
Best believe me she gon' get it all
She said it's just like when you hit a ball
If you gon' swing, you better get it all

She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it

Move back bugs, matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used the be here but now you gone Nair




{Anaconda}

Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas à moins que ça soit bien gros

J'avais un copain qui s'appelait Troy et qui habitait à
Détroit
C'était un gros dealeur, il se faisait du fric
Il a eu des démêlés avec la loi mais il vit dans un
Palace
Il m'a acheté du Alexander McQueen, il me gardait bien
Habillée
Maintenant ça devient sérieux, un flingue dans mon sac, je
Suis venue pour tuer
Qui va y passer en premier ? Ils vont finir sous terre
Là je plane, j'ai seulement prit la moitié d'une pilule
Je suis sur un vrai bail

D'ailleurs, qu'est-ce qu'il dit ?
Il pourra t'le dire ça que je ne manque aucuns repas
J'arrive et le baise dans ma caisse
Rien avoir avec ses autres meufs, et il m'dit d'me calmer
Et il m'dit que c'est du sérieux, et qu'il adore mon
Sex-appeal
Il n'aime pas les filles fines, il veut quelque chose sur
Quoi s'agripper
Donc j'débarque avec ma Jaguar et lui en met plein la vue

Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas à moins que ça soit bien gros
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul

Y'a un mec qui s'appelle Michael et qui kiffait s'payer des
Motos
Une queue plus grosse qu'une tour, mais je ne parle pas de
La Tour Eiffel
Un vrai mec du pays, il me laisse jouer avec son fusil
Je fais ça tellement bien qu'il a besoin de moi pour
Pouvoir bien dormir
Maintenant c'est "bang bang bang bang", je le laisse y
Toucher car c'est un dealeur de coke
Il aime goûter ma salade, c'est comme si elle s'appelait
Romaine
Et dès qu'on finit je fais tout pour qu'il m'achète du
Balmain
Je suis sur un vrai bail

D'ailleurs, qu'est-ce qu'il dit ?
Il pourra t'le dire ça que je ne manque aucun repas
J'arrive et le baise dans ma caisse
Rien avoir avec ses autres meufs, et il m'dit d'me calmer
Et il m'dit que c'est du sérieux, et qu'il adore mon
Sex-appeal
Il n'aime pas les filles fines, il veut quelque chose sur
Quoi s'agripper
Donc j'débarque avec ma Jaguar et lui en met plein la vue

Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas à moins que ça soit bien gros
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul

C'est fin au milieu mais gros à l'arrière
C'est fin au milieu mais gros à l'arrière
C'est fin au milieu mais gros à l'arrière
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul

Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas à moins que ça soit bien gros

N'en veut pas, mon anaconda n'en veut pas..
Mon anaconda n'en veut pas à moins que ça soit bien gros

Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul
Oh mon Dieu, regarde son cul

Ouais, il aime ce bon gros cul
Ouais ! Cette chanson c'est pour les filles avec un gros
Cul, en boîte
J'ai dit, où sont les filles avec un bon gros cul dans la
Boîte ?
J'emmerde les filles toutes fines, j'emmerde toutes les
Filles fines dans la boîte !
Je veux voir toutes les filles avec un gros cul dans la
Boîte
Nique toi si tu fais partie des filles plates, qu'est-ce que
T'as ?

J'ai un bon gros cul ! Allez!










That following year, as we all know with the release of her debut album, “Pink Friday”, a superstar began to emerge…






If that’s not the power of a superstar, then I don’t know what is



Tell us that you would like to have the lyrics of this song. Then we'll make it our highest priority to find these lyrics first!

Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, bring me down

I’m looking back, I see I wasn’t happy
To do, do it again, yeah that would be crazy
It’s so uncommon quiet without you
Got to admit that I long for you
I really need, I really want you to

Refrein
Bring me down!
Yeah I miss that mess you make
Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, Yeah

You’re the river I’ll be drowning in some day

Bring me down

Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, bring me down

Lace me, they bring the whip cream to taste me
If I buy you a drink you gotta compensate me
Damn girl you bootyful, I mean beautiful
Me and you together ain't no telling what we could do
Flee for a week or two, you can bring your peoples too
Bullshit or not, I ain't even got a reason to
When I smoke clear my dear I'm tryna leave with chu
Slitho B's the keys, I get the vehicle
Pull up to the front

Please let me in I'll bring you back tomorrow
I'm tryna leave here with America's Top Model
And I ain't got to spit no game I pop bottles

But I rock with cha fella like the S Dot Kidd
Niggas wanna know her but a bitch so cocky
"Miss bow for her" 'cause my wrists so rocky
Who gon' top me?
Who gon' stop me?
Nickname shippy TV that where they watch me

I don't got a dollar tonight I'll just borrow
Please let me in I'll bring you back tomorrow
I'm tryna leave here with America's Top Model
And I ain't got to spit no game I pop bottles

I ain't got a man sometimes I do borrow
Make my own ends in a bubblegum Benz

Want some more
Want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want some more
Want some more
Want some more
Every time I end up getting to it
Want some more

When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they
Every time I end up getting it

I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying "She a problem"?
Who the fuck came in the game made her own column?
Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though?
You niggas ain't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Miss Icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest cause my dividend is the biggest
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes!
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay Z and Diddy



I'm in this bitch I'm hassadiddy
I popped a Perc and I said "thank you"
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B-Day
These bitches suck, so I nick name these bitches BJ
They want that union,they want that D. Wade
I tell a ho "just be happy they getting leeway"
Alexander, made me Queen
I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash money, getting six albums
No bitch niggas want to bitch out
You niggas apologize and a nigga diss you?
That's a big problem




Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Been looking at the things that you got there
You make me wanna draw pictures of you everywhere
You're kinda funny, but you think that I'm a bad girl
Such a hottie hottie stuck inside a cold world
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
You always seem to like a little hide and seek
You keep me guess, so I can play a game of double jeopardy
You got me wondering if you ever gonna make a move
If you would ask me, I would tell you that it's over, dude
Sometimes I just lie awake
And I rewind and replay everything that you say
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
It's like living on a dream
Running circles in the street
You can call it A.D.D
If you want to
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
I promise I don't need to geek out
But if I ever got you home
I'd tell you baby, I would freak out
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about -
Stuck inside a cold world
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you
It's like living on a dream
Running circles in the street
You can call it A.D.D
If you want to
I can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -
I can't stop thinking about you



You see right through me
How do you do that shit x3
How do you x4

You let me win
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
& when they lookin'
You let me hide
Defend my honor
Protect my pride
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money
Just get my weght up
Know when i'm lying
Know when i'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science
Why am i trying
No you ain't buying
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance
You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at chu
And getting at chu
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at chu
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit x3
How do you x4

What are we doing
Could you see through me ?
Cause you say nikki
And i say who me ?
And you say no you
And i say screw you
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And i start crying
And i start screaming
The heavy breathing
But what's the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
Im actually fronting
Im askin' you something
Yo, answer this question
Class is in session
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind
Capture my soul
Ok your right
Just let it go
Ok you got it
It's in the can
Before i played it
You knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

You see right through me
How do you do that shit x3
How do you x4
Stop ohhh..
..stopp ohhh
Would you just stop looking through me cause i just can't take it
No i can't take it
You see right through me
How do you do that shit x3
How do you x5
You see right through me
You see right through me x2
....yeah yeah



Full lyrics to Nicki Minaj's track "Good Luck" will be posted upon release. These lyrics are made up from a leaked snippet

Keep trying baby, good luck
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch



I drove for miles just to find you
And find myself
All these screams
All these voices in my head
You gave me strength
Gave me hope
For a lifetime
I never was satisfied

This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up

It's not your fault
I'm a bitch
I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast

And I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone
On my throne
All these riches
I came this way
All this way
Just to say

This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up

I'm givin' up baby
I'm givin' up baby


This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up



Hopped off the boat, I am such a immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fisherman
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelin's
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist lookin' like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mami you bad, but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up; go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad

You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free

I'm free
Im free
Im free

I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar
I feel free
Shorty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star
I feel free
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right
I feel free
Most of all 'cause I got life
I feel free




Hello world!
Young moola baby!


Murda dem
That's why they nick-nicknamed me Ninja Nicki

I'm such a yes
And your a no no
Live with a Dragon
And wear a kimono
I'm from the Filipine
Better than Billy Jean
Guess that is why I get more head than an a guillotine
But then I'm dumb struck
Cause you bums suck
Where the um---where the fuck is my nunchuck
I'm in tokyo
Somebody sleepin in my bed like Nokio
You gettin ill, I bet
Poppin a pill again
I'm on ah Island and I'm
Lookin for Gilligan
Where my timberland
I got'em tremblin
Can't find my keys but I know I hear them jingling
Your such a Marilyn---Monroe and Manson
I'm got some heroin, wanna go dancing?
You at the door, ok
I'm bout to come now
I'm getting numb now
Let me come now

I'ts like I'm sippin on tha temple

Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite

Young moola baby!
Yeaaa
I do what I does
I come thru this bitch
Risk blue and cuz
I'm so 5 star su woop to the bloods
And before I had a mirror I knew who I was
I know where I'm goin
I knew where I was
Yea dat da da dirty dirty south
See my shoe full of mud
Baby who can you trust?
Who can you love when love kills like somebody gave Cupid a gun
Like you shooting for fun
& sometimes the solution is execution for some
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one, a.m
And the conclusion is you losing a son
No inducing my funds
I smoke tha fruitiest blunts
I mean the stupidest buds
I get stupid as duh
I swear my doobie is uh---fat and just like it you can get lit
Shit don't stank when you shittin' in the bank
When her man run an errand I'ma hit her like "Hey"
Look him in the eye and a nigga might blink
Aim at his brain and a nigga might think
Weezy

Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite

Yo, It's the President man, and the Mistress, Ms. Nicki Minaj. Aka Nicki Lewinsky. Yea. And I am the president, shut yo mouth!



Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
Bad - like me is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone own, yes I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'mma blow off my money and don't give two -

I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more, 'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Hands up...

Jump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I owe that
But check who you want, and check who you like
Dance all night there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money cause they pay pay pay
And if you're a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am




YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Lee
I be with niggas that shoot police
I keep that iron, you can get creased
And if she say she didn't fuck, bitch ya lying through ya teeth
They say it cost to be the boss
The ones in jail wish they were free
Niggas call me Hi-C because I'm high as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues
Well I'm checking your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas
I'm a Blood, is you a blood donor?
Swisher full of that California
I hit it sideways, catacorner
Then she catch that nut like pneumonia
Lil Tunechi

Lay it down ho

Gimme everything up in you house nigga

Uppercut a bitch out the bus, boom boom
Unless I get the brain, poom poom
She let a nigga run and get the gang, run a train, zoom zoom
Tryna get paid too soon, one deep
One sweep away in a room room

Talking shit and fucking bitches

My shooters still got curb curfews
Yall bout as hot as von dutch

Hijack yall some prom busts
Ain't no retreat but my arms up
We don't graffiti, my bombs up
It's Young Money in this shit until a nigga dead and gone
If you wanna set it off, what you wanna bet it on?
I'm betting the wedding's off when everything is wetted on
Point 'em out, Truk ya life
Fuck ya style, fuck with me

For a dunkin pile, you better duck it, pal

Come out the bank, bye teller

Losing ain't no option, I'm teaching bitches my doctrine

Young-young Money nigga
Young-young, lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down, ah!



Only had a little taste
But I remember how it felt
And all the phone calls late at night
Though we tried, we couldn`t make it right

When the seasons changed
Everything got colder
Everyone could hear, our illusion crush
It was all we had

So every minute that I’ve spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

When we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So...
Brief and beautiful
So...

When flowers bloom in may
I go back to yesterday
When I woke up next to you
I would bring it all back if I could

Make it good or bad
I know it is too late
So I’m moving on
But I won`t forget
All that is unsaid

So every minute that I’ve spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful

When we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So...
Brief and beautiful
So...

It was so short
It was so sweet
Like every good thing
It`s not yours to keep
Everything fades away
And now it’s gone



This one is for the boys with the booming systems
Top down, A/C with the cooling systems
When he come up in the club, he be blazin' up
Got stacks on deck, like he saving up

And he ill, he real, he might got a deal

He cold, he dope, he might sell coke
He always in the air, but he never fly coach


That's the kinda dude I was looking for
And yes, you'll get slapped if you looking hoe

He could ball with the crew. He could solo
But I think I like him better when he do-lo

And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He ain't even gotta try to put the mack on
He just gotta give me that look
When he give me that look
Then them panties coming off off! Oh!

You know I really got a thing for American guys
I mean sigh. Sickening eyes

I hang on every word you said and
No one could get inside my head like you
Then I guess I was a fool for you then
But now I understand
It was all part off your plan
And you should know that

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

Dear God if you can hear me know
Please stop the anger building up inside me
I need you to come and guide me
I look into the eyes
Of the one I thought was mine
And my only scream is

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

No one could get inside my head
You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart

You taught me what it was
To feel the sting of love
To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart

That's why I call you buzz lightyear
Cause by the time you start buzzin

Here she comes
The girl with everything
Never needed nothing until you
Here I am
Committing every sin
Knowing that there's nothing I won't do

Cause I'm easy to love, easy to love
Just get to know me
Once I get going I just can't stop
Easy to love, easy love...

Sometimes I want to shed my skin
Show what's going on yeah
Deep inside
Right now I'm gonna let you in
I know that once you'll get there
You will find that....

I'm easy in love
Easy to love
Just get to know me
Once I get going I just can't stop
Easy to love, easy love
Just one touch
Is more than enough
I'm easy in love

Can't help myself, can't help myself
Something takes me over
I start shaking, body aching
Every time it's stronger
I fake the look of innocence
But it's written on my face
There's something in me I can't change
I guess the trouble is

I'm easy in love
Easy to love
Just get to know me
Once I get going I just can't stop
Easy to love, easy love
Just one touch
Is more than enough
I'm easy in love

To love...Can't help myself...



I'm walking around in circles out of time
Spending out of focus like I lost my hand
Even though I know it's what you did
I'm not gonna show it

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Everytime you bruise me with your words
When you look right through me like you haven't heard
It doesn't really matter
Cause even though I'm shattered

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Tear drops are frozen, in everything you had
I’m stuck in the moment, you're never getting back
Cause even though I'm shattered

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try

Proving it, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
No, no, no, nooo

Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
Walking around in circles out of time



Listen to the static of the radio
Runnin' red lights on my way back home
This is what you do to me
I'm getting away but I got nowhere to go
Your arms are uninviting and your stare is cold
If this is how it's gonna be
Well I'm gonna let it be...
Yeah yeah yeah

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

Believed in every word that came through your theeth
I though to myself that you meant everything
'Cause that's the way you made it seem
So for now I'm gonna let it go
It isn't worth deeping this hole
Where my heart used to be
So I'm gonna let it be...
Yeah yeah yeah

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

You did'nt really want it
You did'nt really need me
Nurse the wounds but they're still open
From the seams watch it bleed

And I didn't wanna see it coming
When you gave it up in the end
And you were the one to let me know it's over
I tried so hard but in the end
I failed again

This isn't love but I'll pretend



Hot dammit it's a miracle
Please adjust the temperature
I switched up the interior in my european 50
Damn Gucci lyrical. Nah I ain't lyrical but my bracelet
Is crazy but my necklace is a miracle
Blacker than Nigeria, with brand new material counting
A quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were richer than a year ago
With three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred
A cheerio. I was error and rude same color as a prune
Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is
Maroon. Roon hearing ert-ert when it skert 26's on
The skirt's and a bird with a flirt
You can tirt I got twerk I keep work in my birds I
Got bird I got bricks I got pounds of that herbs
Ice game is superb so them hoes can suck my dick


Zoom boom I'm 5'4 double R zoom zoom I don't give a
Fuck about ya looney tune goons yellin poon poon when
Your really coon coon. I eat these rap bitches no fork
No spoon, I'm Nicki I been nicki I'm picky I stay around
The six like that little mouse mickey
Ask rocko ask gucci... ask gucci
Gucci bandana. I'm a star I'm the black hannah montana
I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl
I'm sippin on my milkshake with this swirly swirl excuse
Me mister put some cheeries in my cups
I take my shirt off and watch the boyz go nuts!
Boys goes nuts boys-boys goes nuts all the dope boys
All the boys wanna fuck. my niqqa S bezzy keep my wrist
Brezzy why would I go hard when this shit is soo easy




Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor

Hit me on the celly, watching Belly
God's son, I can see they study Makaveli
Peanut butter Benz, got them jelly at the deli
If you feeling like a ninja, I got a machete
Hell yeah, them girls bad, but I'm fucking heavy
I'mma fuck around and have them looking like spaghetti
I say some shit, he be like, "Yo, you so legendary"
But he can tell just by my face he ain't getting any

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy
She was making that noise, oh boy

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy
She was making that noise, oh boy

Verse 2
Meet me at the Rucker, take the Bruckner
It's just me and Young Yucka, taking suckers
For they money and they whips, putting kitten on lips
Dividing them dividends, get the money and dip
Keys to the nigga's safe, put it under my tits
He got ki's of that raw, it could fit in the six
Got a Ups connect, so we good on them trips
Automatic bottle service so we good in them Vips, nigga

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy
She was making that noise, oh boy

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy

These civilians, what up nigga? Excuse my millions
I'm in the V like a widow's peak
It's just me and my Rolls Royce pillow seats
Why they staring at me? I brung Maclaren with me
Yo, matter of fact, I think I'mma bring Donna Karan with me
And you my son, I don't know, it's just the parent in me
I am the best, I am the queen, it's so apparent in me
I'm in Hollywood with Shia Labeouf
Most of you rappers ain't eating, that diet is rough
You want some hot shit? Send that wire to us
I make them change their name to Diddy, retire the puff
I'm getting acting money
You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be acting funny
I'mma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me
Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me
Cock back, Red octagon, stop that

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy
She was making that noise, oh boy

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy
She was making that noise, oh boy

People tryin to fool me call me lil nicki



You said you've had enough
I've packed up all my stuff
I'm waiting for the cab in the hallway
I've got nothing to explain
I'm naked in the rain
Like every part of me is on display

Trying to act like everything's ok
No way

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

I know that you won't call
Won't talk to me at all
You left me in my less than perfect world
I'm done with feeling small
I really gave it all
Tried to be your stupid cover girl

You must be glad you finally had your way

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never write this story
Maybe looking back
Many years from now
When it's all to late to be sorry
You'll be thinking
What did I do?

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you

What did I do?
You say I screwed it up and it cost you
All it took was one slip and I lost you
What did I do?
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you

I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never write this story
I guess we'll never know
But maybe it's not me
Maybe it's you
What did I do?

Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy



You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Uh... uh, yo...
He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me "Mama", "Lil' Mama", I call him "Baby"...

You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Mm-hmm... yo... yo...
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...
Konvict! Just like Akon
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...

You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Find me in the dark, I'll be in the stars;
Find me in your heart - I'm in need of your love...
Your love... your love, your love...
Baby, you're the illest...
Your love...

Your love...



It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVD's made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's which World Tour should I go on and take
See you told me I would lose but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me
Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in L.A. with Lindsey
Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah
Now it's me in my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gone see it in time
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal

I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say
What the fuck they gon' say
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do
'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend, as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo

Ah, it's OK
It's OK, long as you know
Long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best

I get on stage for the first time
The curtains and the lights are down low
And I know in a couple of hours it'll be filled with people and
I'm gonna have to steal the show

Oh, I waited all my life for this moment
And now that it is finally here
In the dying seconds before I go up
I am suddenly struck by fear

'Cause they say the higher up in the air
The bigger the chance you fall
But then I rather be sorry for something I tried
Than to risk never flying at all

So hello world, here I am
I'm gonna give it everything I can
And should I fall, I just get up again
And keep on trying

Yes, if I fall, I just get up again
And keep on tryin'

The curtain opens and here I go
Out of the shadow into the light
Whatever happens in the next few minutes
May well define the rest of my life

And I realize this moment's never coming back
So I stop for a second, stare at the crowd
And make sure that I will never forget

So hello world, here I am
I'm gonna give it everything I can
And should I fall, I just get up again
And keep on trying

Ohoho, part of me will never understand
How I got up here so high
But I'm just gonna fly here while I can
Not worried by the reasons why, oh

Hello world, here I am!

So hello world, here I am
I'm gonna give it everything I can
And should I fall, I just get up again
And keep on trying

Oh, oh
I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep on trying

Hello world
Here I am
I may go but I will stand tall
I'll keep trying over and over and over!

I'll never, I'll never, I'll never
Never, never, never!
No, I won't give up never, never, no

Every day
I'm gonna, I'm gonna give it everything
Yeaheaheah, ohoho
Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna!

Everything I got!



These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Yo Ay yo Ay yo I'ma need 69 real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way but we take the short cuts
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick, came in on a small bus
So give the d-cup, c-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girls on trial but everytime that i come out it's just girls gone wild
Got the dominoe effect in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops they got they X's hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call em cashews
Every other city it's anotha Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches, love me fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty, I sign titties
I got the key to every mothafucking city

These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Yo, yo, yo, yo, okay
So when I'm in the hills I hang with Kristin Cavallari
And when I'm in Miami I'm with Kourtney, Kim and Khloe
And when I'm in the A I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a Diva then I hit Marah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see MIA
Super hero by night, ra ra rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk I'ma hit up Monique
If i need a bad bitch Angelina Jolie
Material Girls like Madonna
Model for Donatella, ain't nothing you can tell her cause she get the mozarella
She look just like Rihanna, she work with Wihelmina only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sippin Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strange
I'm out in Paris mothafucka with Beyonce

Girls girls everyday from London, Canada and the USA
Girls girls everyday from London, Canada and the USA

Dominoes, d-d-dominoes



Memories frozen in a picture frame
Days go on things will never be the same, anymore
Thoughts of you and the life we never lived
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you hear me, I am inconsolable

I wish I’d know you better, time was running out
The quilt I left is more than I can describe
And I keep on calling your name to feel that I’m alive
In this empty space, I could never be replaced

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable

Everyday I try to carry on, everyday I try to find a meaning
Living in a place where I belong, as cold ice can be
If I could take you back to yesterday
But not for ever gone it’s in considerable
It almost that acceptable

Memories frozen in a picture frame
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I can’t go on, pretending everything could be the way we where
How can you see me, when I’m inconsolable

A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t go on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable

Pumps on and them little mini skirts is out

Its a perfect day*
The coolest breeze
Not a cloud in the sky
Casts a shade on me
Colours shining bright
Oh, Its so surreal
And on this perfect day
I got lost
Get me out of this confusion
I'm falling apart
I've got an aching heart
I'm so out of place

And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
On a perfect day
I'm drowning in memories
Throw me a lifeline, don't think its my time
And I can hardly breathe
Oh, why did you have to leave
On a perfect day

And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
We all know that you're not a lonely heart
We can't stand the laws
You're watching over us, taking care of us
Until we meet again, my friend
You are everything to me and I love you for it
But now you're gone
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on, so carry on, I carry on
It'll be okay



Dentro al buio del locale
Musica che è sempre uguale
Luci basse che mi danno un po' fastidio
Quelle gambe un po' intriganti
Con le calze trasparenti
Qui si fanno tutte belle ma chissà per chi
Forse io dovrei andare
Quasi l'ora di dormire
Se mi guarda ancora un po' mi sa che vado lì
Sì ma tanto cosa dico
Hai un ragazzo o un marito
Studi o fai un lavoro interessante e unico
Io non voglio più sprecare una parola
Perché il gioco proprio non lo reggo più
Cose della serie tu sei qui da sola
Sono anni che mi urtano
Mi rovinano da troppo tempo
L'ultimo bicchiere e me ne andrò
Che non se ne può più
Di tutte queste storie finte che si basano sui film
Ma non ti danno mai qualcosa
Più di un freddo vuoto
Quante storie storie vere lui che le offrirà da bere
Come se non si capisse che intenzioni ha
Forse non per amicizia e neanche con dolcezza
Ma poi lei dirà tu che cos'hai capito
Io non voglio più sprecare una parola
Perché il gioco proprio non lo reggo più
Cose della serie tu sei qui da sola
Sono anni che mi urtano
Mi rovinano da troppo tempo
L'ultimo bicchiere e me ne andrò
Che non se ne può più
Di tutte queste storie finte che si basano sui film
Ma non ti danno mai qualcosa
Più di un freddo vuoto
L'ultimo bicchiere e me ne andrò
Che non se ne può più
Di tutte queste storie finte che si basano sui film
Ma non ti danno mai qualcosa
Più di un freddo vuoto
L'ultimo bicchiere e me ne andrò
Che non ne posso più
Di tutte queste storie finte che si basano sui film
Ma non ti danno mai qualcosa
Più di un freddo vuoto...



You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4

You let me win
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
& when they lookin'
You let me hide
Defend my honor
Protect my pride
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money
Just get my weght up
Know when i'm lying
Know when i'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science
Why am i trying
No you ain't buying
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance
You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at chu
And getting at chu
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at chu
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you

You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4

What are we doing
Could you see through me ?
Cause you say nikki
And i say who me ?
And you say no you
And i say screw you
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And i start crying
And i start screaming
The heavy breathing
But what's the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
Im actually fronting
Im askin' you something
Yo, answer this question
Class is in session
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind
Capture my soul
Ok your right
Just let it go
Ok you got it
It's in the can
Before i played it
You knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x4
Stop ohhh..
..stopp ohhh
Would you just stop looking through me cause i just can't take it
No i can't take it
You see right through me
How do yall do that shit x3
How do yall x5
You see right through me
You see right through me x2
....yeah yeah



Could never thank me for opening doors but they ain't even thank nicki when she did it before
Giving credit is to much money is what I touch and fuck if it ain't enough
My career is coming with a blueprint talk slick now yo face talking shoe prints
My rhymes fresher then a peppermint
These other niggas cheap man these others niggas newsprint
Oh shit I put these rappers on did yll know I body rappers on they own songs
Do I really spit crazy like they say I do when you counting my money 4 zeros behind the 2
Now let me brake it down I got the baddest sound
I did more shit then any other underground
Got 1 album omega killed them all
I think it's fun to see these trashy rappers fall
Fuck you and yo rhymes nigga pick up the ball
You my servant nigga pick up my calls
Making my way around but nope I'm not playing baseball
Love peanut butter and I ain't talking bout ru paullllll

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Who I think better then me nobody
This is a remix but I done copped 4 bodies
They wanna be me so they making 4 copies
But the copies that they made was 4 floppies
And the diamond on my hand is called real rocky
Let me say my name is blue and I'm real good at this
I'm happy for my success so I decided to bliss
And you see that's watch on my arm it just decided to gliss
Why they so mad I guess I stay pissing them off
Them jealous whack rapper mad cuz they took the lost
Tyrna buy what I buy but can't never pay the cost
That's why These whack niggas is shopping at Ross
I'm sorry dat yll losing and I'm sorry dat yll mad at me cuz I just keep winning

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

I thought you'd changed
I thought you'd changed
But I was wrong again
You're still the same
You're still the same
Rumors never end
There's nothing more
There's nothing left
And now we can't pretend
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never know
I'll never know
Why you hurt me so
We were cool
We were close
But that's so long ago
You create, you fabricate
The shit that you don't know
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
There's nothing more

And now we can't pretend
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?

Lunghilunghilunghilunghilunghilù!

Sveglia alle 7, mi lavo in fretta
Butto giù un caffè, prendo la moto
Faccio mezz'ora di strada ma arrivo
Più o meno puntuale in quella scuola

Solite facce, solita gente, solita giornata
Mentre il mio prof mi guarda schifato i capelli

Ma io non sono come voi
No, a me non frega niente
Se cammino e mi sento dire

Tagliati i capelli
Che non vanno più di moda!
Tagliati i capelli
Se vuoi fare strada!
Tagliati i capelli
Che sembri un barbone, un drogato, insomma
Tagliati i capelli
Come me!

Ore 14, ma dove sono
E cosa sto facendo qui
Sto certamente buttando via tempo
Pensando a tutt'altro che alla scuola
"Guarda che gli anni dei capelloni
Sono già passati da un bel pezzo!"
Pazzo!
Io che ti guardo negli occhi e ti rispondo
Che a me non me frega un...

Tagliati i capelli
Che non vanno più di moda!
Tagliati i capelli
Se vuoi fare strada!
Tagliati i capelli
Che sembri un barbone, un drogato, insomma
Tagliati i capelli
Come me!

Uh, uh, uh
Oh, oh, oh

Lunghilunghilunghilunghilunghilù!

Tagliati i capelli
Che non vanno più di moda!
Tagliati i capelli
Se vuoi fare strada!
Tagliati i capelli
Che sembri un barbone, un drogato, insomma
Tagliati i capelli
Come me!

Tagliati i capelli!
