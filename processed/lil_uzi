Worried about busting them straps
Lil Uzi ya you know I be smoking that pack
If she gon leave then you know she coming right back
In a Cadillac do a drive by with a mac
When I walk in none of these hoes can relax
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
Came right in put my city on my back
But I'm still so relaxed on a xanax
I don't care what you did, don't love you less
But its still Margiela all on my vest
Water cross on my neck
I just flew to the A

I ain't talking paper planes
On the block with all my chains
Got the money and the fame
You a lame that's a shame

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It's funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over

They know she's mine 'cause I rule her
She says he does fine but I'm cooler
I got way more diamonds than your jeweler
All my girls dress like they work at Hooters
First I get my racks and then I backpack
No, I don't subtract, I might just add that
Did it on my own, no, you can't tax that
This that under the table, you can't track that
Put money ahead and I move with the bread
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up, nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth

No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It's funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over

Hey, hey, hey, hey

My bitch Spanish, told her twerk then she hit the salsa
You need twenty, thirty, forty, that's how much it cost ya
Mixin' up that perico, spread it on the table
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso

Fuck your man, bitches wanna fuck with young Khalifa
Cause I got that sauce I be bunkin' through your speakers
Married to the money, fuck her once then I don't need her
Big booty latina, twerkin' while she roll my weed up
All my niggas on, Lil Uzi hit me for a feature
Never trust a broad, ya'll some unstable creatures
Chevy get the call, I'm in Cali, we should link up
Back when I was young, servin' strong in-front the teachers
Now I'm much older, prices way cheaper
Came a long way from that Motorola beeper
Movin' state to state with just an iPhone and a Sidekick
Upgrade the room and get a flight for my lil side bitch

That queso, that queso, that queso
Hey, hey, hey, hey

My bitch Spanish, told her twerk then she hit the salsa
You need twenty, thirty, forty, that's how much it cost ya
Mixin' up that perico, spread it on the table
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso
My plug good, he mix the yayo, queso, queso, queso



Bust-bustin' traps on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Had-had your bitch all on my phone
Then she gave me dome
Tra-tra-trappin' on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Your bitch on my phone
That bitch give me dome

Gave me dome, gave me dome
Off the shits, I don’t know
What the fuck you sayin'?
Jumpin’ in the Rolls, sippin’ on this Rose
2-2-3 and balls, all my diamonds close
Chains look like snow and them bitches go
All my bitches hoes, they be sniffin’ coke
I don’t sniff no coke
Trippers have ahead, Glizzy with the sticks
Forty five with balls, you ain’t really know, I was with the shits
Now you really know
Speakin’ two different languages
And made it out of joke, xanny, eyes closed
Ballin’ like I’m Sammy, chillin’ in Miami
I just need a Grammy
Chillin’ on the ocean, pussy to be flowin’
She ain’t got no panties
You’ll be on the floor, I am not an human
All this be just splattin’
Boy you still let me
My own niggas trappin’

Bustin' traps on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Ha-had, your bitch all on my phone
Then she gave me dome
Tra-tra-trappin' on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Your bitch on my phone
That bitch give me dome

All of my bitches they fine and they right
Still suck my dick the first night
Sippin Rosé cause I’m not gettin’ high
Mix the codeine with the sprite
Hoes on my dick, try to fuck and I'm wasted
I think I'm Future, No Basic
Can’t fuck that bitch if she basic
Like have a brick from my bracelet
Pull up tryna stunt in a wraith
Pull up try to race on my stripe
Yo bitch let me fuckin’ it straight
Disrespect her and  bustin’ in face
Money thats one thing thats gonna stay on my mind
I give her all of my time
Touch that bitch til I’m all on my way but I lie
She don’t distribute  a dime
And you drop but you never stop hittin’ my line
I got you go strippin’ on line
They don’t got me, just sit on and last
Thirty shot clips on that
Try to run and get hit in the splat
If you jug you get hit and get splash
It gets me up in the hood, post it up with my ice and my gun with my nigga

Bustin' traps on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Had your bitch all on my phone
Then she gave me dome
Tra-tra-trappin' on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Your bitch on my phone
That bitch give me dome



Full lyrics available upon release
Oo, oo, oo
Metro Boomin want some more nigga!

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I...

Uzi's to blame
Diamonds on chain
Look at the fangs
Vampire Mane
Pants came from Japan
Bitches way up out of France


Woah
Pants came from Japan
But not talking bout no socks

Who is to blame? Diamonds on chain
Look at the jewelry, I did it so beautifully
Niggas can't fuck with me, it's suicide, nigga come scrutinize
I'm with the Metro, she with the Petro
Come with the fellow
She blow like a Cello, said the diamonds is all yellow
Pants on me like a farmer
Ten million under armour
Still do a deal with Nike, then we get cut, not

Stay in yo motherfuckin' lane, get ya'll drip and shit
Stay in your late, okay?
Okay, stay in your motherfuckin'  lane
Y'all ain't even got no money to be me
Y'all keep tryna' fake me
Y'all keep tryna fake me, talking 'bout you for the people
If you don't stay in your lane, dude
Stay in ya'll motherfucking lane
Stay in your lane dude, you fucker

Wrist, where the magic at?
Where the attic at?
Where you hide it at? Where you stash it at?
Gun go rat-a-tat, nigga leave em flat
Fuck these niggas out here, sneakin' n' bein' cats
I don't believe in cats

Believe in cats



Oo, oo, oo
Oh, yeah, okay, okay, okay
Hold on, I got the jet lag
Perform in the rain with the Air Mags
Your bitch all on me, 'cause I walk around right with the stacks yeah ooo mmm
Getting the money, I get it right back
That nigga be blacked, just like my Salmon
Uh, What happened? uh, I don't even know, these niggas lyin'
They should be cappin', what no cap?
Bad bitch on me from the what?
Bad bitch on me, I don't want it
Bangin' that hoe right on wax
Pull up just right in the Jeep



I live how I want, I Do What I Want
Huh, what? huh yeah Bad bitch on me, she's like where?
I get the money, I get the lil paper
They look at the shit that I wear
You dig on my dick, and I'm drippin' this
Like dissin' these niggas, they mad that I'm here
Okay my swaggin' so ill
So they try to take it out the air
They try to act just like me
Now your bitch all in my face
Got a condo on condo
Got a crib out in crib
Got your bitch on my dick
Pass that bitch to my bro
She stay on that rib, told that bitch I'mma get it
Put my dick in her ribs
Movin' the shit, smokin' gas not the cig
Your bitch wanna get me
She all on you but you ain't got muscles, you is a twig
I'm gettin' the paper
I don't want that hoe, that's a trick for a treat
Okay



Still rappin', still rappin'
And I look like I'm still trappin'
Other niggas yeah they still cappin'
Niggas ain't have to film nothing
You ain't feel rabid
You ain't feel the wrath of a nigga rockin' RAF
29 Jeans, don't wear a 40
Don't wear no 40, but hold a .40
I fucked her daughter, now she my shorty
Back in the days I blow that haze and drink a 40
These niggas be funny, and they all be dummies
Dummies, Dummies, and they bummy
And my fucking sneakers gummy
And I fuck it put it inna tummy
And her Pussy, yummy yummy
Fucking on it
I'm a fuckin' bastard
I'm a fuckin' savage
Man, I had to have it
I'm a playboi though I stay out the field
With a bad bitch in a vert  headed to the studio
Niggas tryna surpass,  know what I'm sayin?



Shoot at his leg, he hop
Shoot at his leg, he hop
Shoot at his leg, he hop
Where would the game be?

I'm mixin' them words like a synonym
Rockin' that shit like its Vetements
Fuck on your bitch 'cause she heaven sent
Smell on that girl and she heaven scent
Gettin' these girls is what's happenin'
Used to have Ashley, used to have Keisha
Nowadays I just be havin' fans
Go in the club and I'm throwin' bands
Oh you a stripper? Give me a dance
I got all types of girls
Just know I'm always with something tan
Diamonds so clear, that's spick and span

Used to have Ashley, used to have Keisha
My new coupe peel out the Radisson
I don't miss a lot

Look at you, gonna go shop again
Fuck what they say when we flockin' in
But too bad the scale only stop at 10
And I always come in first
And you always gotta settle for less
Got the Lambo, I ain't want a Jag
Had her in my path
Yeah you know it's digital
Grab it from the back, yeah
Grab her waist real tight
When I'm in, it make her bite me back
All different girls, like where your type be at?
If I got locked up would you write me back
Or just chase another bag? Yeah

Used to have Ashley, used to have Keisha
My new coupe peel out the Radisson
I don't miss a lot

My number ain't change girl call my phone
Don't say that shit, that's the same song
Hope ya’ll are looking at the same, no
Inside the coupe white like mayo
Might drop my top just to let the brain go

Baby show me top when I'm feeling alone, no no
I'm so gone

I was patient
You were faking
I was waiting
Stuck around then the money came in
I know you hate it
Your niggas hate it
It's hard to say it
It's been amazing but I don't want no conversation
Pull up in a spaceship not a Maserati baby
These are not in store, no you cannot find this baby
Diamonds shining baby no you cannot have this baby
I do what I want
All these rules ain't fun
I might take you from him

Baby show me top when I'm feeling alone, no no
I'm so gone

She give me head so I call her a nerd

I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel, my body sore

Now a days I gotta swerve, oo
I took you out of the front, oops

I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now

No girl that will make a sound
I don't wanna talk about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
Used some bodies, now i'm fine now
Used some bodies I don't know about
But I love to see you burning out
But I love to see you burning out

I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
Different cause I am so hot
Now my first merry-go-round
Now my first merry-go-round yea
Living life just with a curse
That's why i'm calling a hearse
Told you that I love you first

‘Cause they all mortals and I'm immortal
They can't stop me, only thing they can do is watch me

We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'

And we workin', we workin', and these haters, they hatin'
And I'm swervin', and I'm drinkin' on that purple, words slurrin'
And I'm killin' it, and I'm feelin' it
When I'm gone off of that trippy stick
"But I thought, Vert, you ain't smoke"
Bitch, get off my dick again
‘Cause I'm making all this money, and this shit ain't nothin'
If you keep talking shit then you gon' have to deal with these repercussions
And I be just doing anything that I want ‘cause I go loco
Got yo' bitch all on my dick, bust it open for a Four Loko
I said that bitch go crazy, I said that bitch go crazy
I said that bitch be your lady, yeah, that bitch go crazy
Had to say it one more time, ‘cause I be feeling that shit
And I ain't 'bout to set trip, but I know some Blood and some Crip
Got a bitch all on my dick, rolling off the acid trip
Yeah, she sucking all on my balls, and she licking all on that tip
I'm a ratchet motherfucker, and I got a ratchet bitch
Well, she just kinda raunchy, that ass kinda chunky
And I don't fuck with the golds, bitch, I'm platinum plus
And I got yo' bitch all on me, she know that I'm a thug
And you do what you can, but a nigga do what he want
And it's that Lil Uzi Vert, but I got a pump

They say Lil Uzi Vert jet ski and I'm floatin'
Yeah, they call me, "Broski," yeah, they know I'm floatin'
When I'm in some fly shit or when I'm with a foreign bitch
Making all this money, riding in a foreign whip
Rocking all these foreign clothes, it's foreign this and foreign that
When I'm overseas, you know I'm busting all these foreign traps
Yeah, that be the plug, nigga, what you want?
I finesse and I just flex, finessin' the jugg
I could kill anything that I get on
And I could fuck any bitch when I get on
Lil niggas tote guns but don't know right from wrong
I hope I taught you something by the end of this song

Extended clip right on the Uzi
My bitch got extended clip right on the fifth
Rollie matching on the wrist
And She love sucking my dick, and you love taking her out

You like taking her out
Dickin' her down, fuck out my house
We moving it in and pitching it out
Might give her the dick, don't be running your mouth
You won't make it upstairs, get fucked on the couch
Slow it down, when I'm in the building smelling like a pound
Yeah Uzi tell her wipe it down

Man I swear, it looks deceiving
And your little bitch on my dick for no reason
Man I swear, it looks deceiving

She only want me cause I'm eatin'
Oh, I looks deceiving
If she ain't tryna fuck me bitch you leaving
You leaving, bitch you leaving

She said Lil Uzi, can't keep my name out her mouth
Yeah I was all in your bed, nigga I fuck with your house
I open the trunk, nigga what you want
This .50 Cal have you right in a rut
Nigga I am on the rise, in the kitchen with my guys
I'm I ain't grippin her lips, then I be grippin' her thighs






When you look at my eyes it just be drippin' drippin'
When you look at my rang, it be bling-blaow!
Took a hipster bitch to shop at VFILES
I got bread on bread I'm the cash cow
Bitch give me some head, while I'm layin' down
I been town to town whippin' Maybach



Homicide Homicide Homicide
Keep calling my number
Diamond go stupid, they dumber
You got that banana clip?
Don't give a fuck bout your money
