[Intro]
KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said, "I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to"

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
I just a-rove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves



[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon beef foreva

[Verse 1]
Why you always tryna run and hide
Always have my name up in your mouth you outta line
You gon' make me pop up at your door like surprise
Like come outside lil' bitch come outside
Never by my lonely got my niggas by my side
And all my niggas skrr skrr yeah they down to ride
Yeah my bitches go to work I'm talking 9 to 5
The streets want to fuck around you won't stay alive
Your man can cross you and I make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lacking when you coming home from work at night
You run your mouth I poppin out now it's on sight
You gon' be just like my pussy hella tight
A hoe can hate but don't be fucking with my commas
And if she is I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up
Can't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve them
Cardi backing down I swear to God that's not an option

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me we gon beef foreva

[Verse 2]
Some bitches claim they with the shits but they ain't with a thing
I spend the block come around like a boomerang
Silence silence I don't hear a thing
Worry about me but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check nothing less that's all I do
10 bands 50 bands ain't nothing new
I see some people who still worried about my revenue
I'm eating good you wish you could don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female ain't no way to live
You bitch made make me wonder if you got a dick
How you feeling like a man envying a chick
Wake up and go get some money go and find your niche
Silly muthafucka who raised you
A nigga with a pussy how disgraceful
I have my hittas come and duck tape you
And your bitch could get it too double date boo
So let's get it so let's get it so let's get it let's not waste a minute
You clearly started so let's finish
I don't do forgiveness, they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business
I'm running down and I'm with it

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me I be rude whereva
If a bitch beef with me we gon beef foreva



[Intro]
Yeah
Lookin' like I caught a (Look at me)
Cardi (Look at me)
Cardi (Look at me)
Woah

[Hook]
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Verse 1]
Look at me, look at me
They ain't like me before, now they bookin' me
The glow got bitches so shook at me
They like, "Chef Cardi B, what you cookin' B?"
I say, "Bitches, got me on some new shit"
I swear niggas got me feelin' ruthless
Too much mo'fuckers done doubted me
That's why I had to just prove it
I remember walkin' in the stores, I couldn't buy nothin'
They look at me starin'
Now I just walk in the stores, I like it I cop it
I don't even think
Bank tellers asking for info
'Cause now my deposits on Kimbo
Told that bitch, "Gimme my money
Why the fuck you askin' all this info?"

[Pre-Hook]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit

[Hook]
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Verse 2]
See me in my 'bach, now they all surprised
Now they call my phone, I just press decline
Not even six seconds, I don't give 'em Vine
Tell 'em, "Fall back," all must recline
Bitches mad as fuck but I don't give a fuck
Niggas can't believe it, better soak it up
Lookin' like I caught a lick, bitch
Your nigga got me on his wishlist
Thought I was makin' no moves?
Thought I was gon' be livin' in Sues?
Thought I was makin' no money?
You fuckin' thought I was gon' lose
Everythin' I did, I swear I got paid
Been 'bout my money, that ain't gon' change
Bitch, you gon' drown tryna ride on my wave
Corny ass bitches, I just can't relate

[Pre-Hook]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit

[Hook]
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Outro]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me



[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Some regular degular, bloody bars

[Verse]
I swear to God, they ain't wanna see me leave the club
Got up on my shit and now they scared to show me love
They'd rather see me on the pole twerkin' it for dubs
I guess I really gotta show them what the fuck is up
I'm on some other shit, that Cardi B gutta shit
Every time I catch a hating bitch, she on her stutter shit
Can't finish her words but on Instagram thuggin' shit
You set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch
And niggas hatin' on me, really be upset
I don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs
You a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?
You's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo!
Bite down, bite down, it was crunch time
Yeah I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line
I put in work, now I'm here at the front line
Ready for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline
Touch mine, getting slumped, slimed one time
Pump blind, bitches quick, then I dump mine
Pull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes
Flyer than a big big B with a Blood tie
Don't do much, he get hard when I bust wines
No straws for this juice box, got one time
Last nigga I was with went insane
'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine
I'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop
From the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch
Quick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc
Grips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops
Wealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all
Now he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure
You gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all
Never feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol
Travel all around the states getting nice checks
I was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set
Is that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?
I'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech
Got 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet
Wire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch
I worked hard, took the right steps, had a shot
So I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest

[Outro]
Uh
I said, woo!
Huh




Letra de "Bodak Yellow (Latin Trap Remix)" ft. Messiah El Artista[Translation]

[Intro: Cardi B]
KSR (ooh)
Hah, it's Cardi, ayy
Said, "I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to"
Umm...

[Coro: Cardi B]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque tú quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mamá
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo alante y tú atrás
Esta canción es pa' mis goonies y mis cueros
Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero
Si me ves no me saludes, tú y yo no somos amigas
Si tú no haces dinero tú no eres de las mías

[Verso 1: Cardi B]
¿Dique que tú puedes contra mi? Vamo' a averiguar
Vamo' allá, soy rapera y también yo sé pelear
You in the club, tú chapeando, yo llegando y cobrando
Siempre estoy depositando, 'tan cansao' de mí en el banco
En verdad, no me importa a quien yo le caiga mal
Llevo dos mixtapes en seis meses, nadie me puede parar
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
All these bitches son mis hijas, to'as se copian de mí
Mira, yo me robo a tu novio—ooh—, hago coro con tu esposo
Tu jevo 'ta aficia'o, sé que lo tengo sabroso
Yo se lo pongo en el paso, I'm like, "Okay"
Yo le pido lo que quiera, él me compra mi cartera y una jeepeta
Lo tengo tan aficia'o que hasta me paga mi renta
Soy la más dura en la calle, know you prolly heard of me
Me busca, me arreglé los dientes, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
Pago la renta de mi madre y no dependo de nadie
Si no hablas de dinero es mejor que ni me hables

[Coro: Cardi B]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque tú quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mamá
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo alante y tú atrás
Esta canción es pa' mis goonies y mis cueros
Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero
Si me ves no me saludes, tú y yo no somos amigas
Si tú no haces dinero tú no eres de las mías

[Verso 3: Messiah El Artista]
¿Dique que tú puedes contra mi? Suelta eso, bi
Nigga, please, to mis show son pago, ninguno gratis
Créeme a mí, no hagas que yo coja aquí un felony
I'm the big beef for well, these niggas know my pedigree
Honestly, I got bad bitches that wanna fuck with me
Suck on me, ride me crazy y dejarme seco a mí
Que yo no 'taba sonando, que no 'taba haciendo bulla
Dique que estaba apagao y pegao con la jeva tuya
Ando con mi primo Lucas, un corito sano y con par de putas
Lo que tu gasta' una noche en botellas, eso yo lo gasto en refilles de hookah
Los cueros dicen: "Messiah 'ta de pinga, porque nos da y después se embala"
A lo mejor ella pensaba que yo iba a darle y después mudarla
Andamo' en la calle, osea en la lleca
Andamo' fumando peyote, purple haze en mi yerba
Hablan mierda a tu espalda y cuando te ven ellos no dicen na'
Ando con mi hermano DJ Hova and tonight we gonna shake the block

[Coro: Cardi B]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque tú quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mamá
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo alante y tú atrás
Esta canción es pa' mis goonies y mis cueros
Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero
Si me ves no me saludes, tú y yo no somos amigas
Si tú no haces dinero tú no eres de las mías

[Hook]

You want to be my main squeeze baby don't you
You want to give a bitch a seat baby don't you

Real niggas fuck with me the bad bitches fuck with me

Every time that I'm on the road popping
Every time that I do a show popping
When I put this pussy on the pole popping
Friends want to have these cornrows popping

[Hook]
I need all my money makers bring that cash out
I need all my D boys to bring that cash out
I need all my scammer niggas bring that cash out
Don't you see these big ass titties and this ass out

[Verse 1]
The nerve of you bitches
Like, oh my God, I got no words for you bitches
Like, who's really serving you bitches?
I need some answers, I'm worried for bitches
Like, this really absurd
No wonder these niggas stay curving you bitches
Don't even take no more selfies
That weave don't even deserve any pictures
Like, where did you buy that shit?
Who really acknowledged it?
What made you feel that you would be lit if you went and copped that shit?
They tell you ya look good?
Wasn't you iffy?
Oh, I know, they tell you that you get two bundles for fifty
Girl, you ain't low
I know how this go
Cheap shoes is okay, cheap dress is okay, but cheap weave is a "no"
Don'tcha do it to yourself that's bad for your health
Don't fuck up your flow
Talk shit about me with ya dusty ass weave?
Now you outta control
I'm Cardi B, I come through and I kill everything, everything and that's a fact
Got me on my hitman shit like brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap
I'm fully reloaded, full clip
I cut to the chase, snip-snip
That weave gotta go, pink slip
Looking washed up, drip-drip

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

[Chorus]
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave

[Verse 2]
Cardi B killing shit, I'm causing casualties
I am a masterpiece, you are a tragedy
Finish you like Mortal Kombat; fatality
I got shit jumping like What a Time...
Like Jumpman, Jumpman
That weave you got should be a crime
You got no luck, man
And how you niggas even let them in the crib with that?
You know that weave stink, that shit need a Tic Tac
Now you tell me you pulling hair off your pillows, hair off the sheets, and even hair out your asscrack
So cheap weave is okay? I think I missed that
I see a track showing, you need to fix that
You got a braid loose, you need to twist that
You got it fucked up, I would never pick that
Lady Leshurr done told y'all to go brush your teeth
But after you done, you leave the crib with that cheap ass weave?
I'm begging Lord, oh God, oh God, oh please, oh please
Please just bless these thots, these thots with they cheap ass weave

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

[Chorus]
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave



[Intro: Kodak Black]
Ayy, ayy, you know, you know why I fuck with Cardi B?
'Cause they be thinkin', they be thinkin' both of us crazy and shit
Like this sound like some, some, some, Bodak Orange shit
Or some, some Kodak Orange shit, man... like... ayy

[Chorus: Cardi B & Kodak Black]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to (ayy, ayy, ayy)
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
(woo, woo, woo! yah, yah, they're bloody shoes, bloody shoes)
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose (yah, yah, yah, wanna choose, ayy)
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look (woo! yah, yah, yah, bih', don't get comfortable, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I don't dance now, I make money moves (yeah bih', I make money moves, ayy)
Said I don't gotta dance, I make money moves, (woo!, bih, I make money moves, ayy, ayy, ayy)
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you (nigga, I don't fuck with you, ayy, I don't fuck with you)
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves (yah, I make money moves)

[Verse: Kodak Black]
I ain't worried 'bout her, that's an old ho
You thought I was comin' with my old flow
Kodak ain't com to take no photo
I don't even pull up in a four door
I just hit a lick, hit the load though
All my life smokin' on JoJo
He was just posted up with dough though
Now he gettin' slammed by the popo
Thuggish, buggish, ruggish shit
I can't leave the streets, I love this shit
Never gave a shit 'bout a messy bitch
I ain't never take a risk for a petty lick
I'm at Digital Heights and I'm goin' on a heist
Dead presidents, John Kennedy
Dead presidents, pockets Mount Everest
When I step on the scene it's a felony (yeah, yeah)
Christian Louboutin (yeah)
These ain't Louis Vuittons (huh)
Hit a Kodak Bop on nae nae
I wanna top me a Nae Nae
Now I'm in a white whip, no mayonnaise
Stole a new car for me, Audi A8
Cardi B brought the beat, told me re-rock the heat
Try me, I'll do the race like I'm Tay-K
It ain't no flockin' over here, lil' buddy
All of us zombies over here, lil' buddy
All of us robbin' 'cause they love your money
Got our own money, but we love your money
Crack a nigga's head wide open like a pumpkin
Jaguar F-Type orange like a pumpkin
Young nigga, I got old hundreds
Smokin' K2 with my bunkie (woo!)

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to (woo!)
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes (woo, woo!)
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look (ayy, woo!)
I don't dance now, I make money moves (ayy, ayy)
Said I don't gotta dance, I make money moves (woo!)
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves (bloody moves, bloody moves, bloody moves...)



[Intro]
I'm your...

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm Cardi B with the wicked flow
Ask them, I keep them niggas on their tippy toes
Nick-nack-paddy-wack, give a dog a bone
Got him runnin' home, fuck him good, get that money flow
Pussy got him goin' places he would never go
Pussy got him cookin', now he wanna clean the stove
Pussy got him fucked up, I think he overdosed
But I ain't Travis Scott, I ain't got no antidote
Antidote, antidote

[Hook]
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that

[Verse 2]
Yo, some people know me as a stripper hoe
But stripper hoes get the money and blow digits though
A lot of bitches talkin' down on me like I'm a joke
Talk shit, I'll fuck your man, send him back hella broke
I'm laughin', but I really mean it though
I'm on another level like I'm playin' Mario
These bitches can't see me, even with a telescope
Every day I'm shittin' on 'em, I don't flush the toilet bowl
Ew! Cause I be workin' and workin'
All these heads I be turnin', they on my body like surgeons
I think they see my conversion
That's why they be lurkin', but their feelings be hurtin'
Or remember when I wanna dance at certain clubs
And they told me, "No, no, that's a dub"
Now they the same niggas blowin' up my phone
Wantin' me to host, oh word? That's a dub
Bands

[Hook]
I think I like that
(I know, I know they're mad now)
I think I like that
I think I like that
(Hurtin' my feelings)
I think I like that

[Verse 3]
When I come up in the building I initiate
I'm the reason why the fuckers gotta renovate
I'm eatin' good and they mad they can't get a plate
Never thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states
Before the century they didn't even look this way
Now they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak
Got 'em sending gifts, it's not even my birthday
You niggas soft and I meant that in the worst way
Oh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag
You hustlin'-backwards ass bitch, you're doin' bad
It's pretty sad, you should be getting more than that
Suck a dick so you can pay your rent, couple months with that
I mention flow, keep it on the low, I tell you facts
When a nigga 'bout to cum, just throw it back
It's over, you won, that nigga trapped
And that bank account, girl? Empty that



[Chorus:]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more
I don't really stress it no more
I don't be trusting them
I don't be stressing them
I swear I just flex on them
I swear I just flex on them

[Verse 1:]
Carbi B, me bad one
You bitches sad ones
I just get my money and I style on them
All them bitches broke and they mad I just dab on them
Wave bye hit the gas on them
200 on the dash on them
I don't say much I just swag on them
I be killing them I go Fab on them
Left right throwing jabs at them
Night night Ima black on them
Hit the game raw no magnums
Can't stop winning God finna go platinum

[Chorus:]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more
I don't really stress it no more
I don't be trusting them
I don't be stressing them
I swear I just flex on them
I swear I just flex on them

[Verse 2:]

Probably leave with ya man, grand larceny
Bitch, pardon me, you don't wanna start with me

Keep it litty for my city, NYC
Take the whole nut, ain't worried 'bout no Plan B
Yeah, I'm nasty, lick my lips, blow a kiss
And walk off with a hunnid thou' on my wrist
Swish, I ain't with the politics
"A hoe never gets cold," you know what the motto is
Unless it's baguettes diamond cuts, gold bottles, bitch
Sittin' in that 6, frostbite, feelin' hella lit

[Hook]
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slayin' shit, I'm in the best fit
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch

[Verse 2]

But I'm a queen just tryna build the castle

[Intro]
Oh, how you doin'?
I'm alright
(laughs)

[Verse 1]
Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwin' deals from left to right
But I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happen overnight
All that flexin' they be doin', shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fuckin' lit
And don't be talkin' all that sorry shit, don't flip the script
I see the lights, I hear the hype, I hit the mic
I kill the show, I get my dough, I catch a flight
I see a hater, I'm runnin' down, it's on sight
I throw my hands, I hit em' left, I hit em' right

[Verse 2]
They sleepin' on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowin' up my phone, sayin' everythin' I touch is lit
Actin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit, woah
I let 'em live, let the shady motherfuckers live
Get them the price then it's time to show them what it is
Don't got the bat? Well then what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time, I ain't never been no average bitch

[Verse 3]
Not to mention, I did my tour and that shit was winnin'
Independent, the headline, award of feelin'
I thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given
I love the fans, they fill me up with their ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted
Wave the white flag, girl, you might as well just forfeit

[Verse 4]
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now, lookie now, nigga I'm that bitch
What you thought? Yeah, you really lost, now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga, I was always on my shit, yeah
I used to stare at magazines on the train
Lookin' at these models like, "I gotta be this one day"
Fuck around, got myself a name, now I'm gettin' paid
Left the corny bitches in the grave, so they throwin' shade

[Outro]



[Intro:]
I hate when I'm using a guy and shit and they start catching feelings and like no matter what I tell them like they just don't stop liking me. Like I be like listen I'm a hoe I don't cook I don't clean like trust me you don't want me to be the mother of your kids.

If it's green I'ma get it please stay the fuck out my business
Bitch try me I promise you get it

Gotta watch all these faces there's too many counterfeits
Sometimes when you hear them say I got you you can't even count on it
That's why I fuck with my bitches only my bitches

They gave a bitch two options: stripping or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get in Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in them shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm dripping in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from making tuna sandwiches to making the news
Started speaking my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs

Get money, go hard, you're motherfucking right
Never been no fraud in my motherfucking life
Get money, go hard, damn fucking right
Stunt on these bitches out of motherfucking spite

Ain't no running up on me, went from nothing to glory
I ain't telling ya to do it, I'm just telling my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from way too lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smiling in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climb to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just trying to chill and make bangers"
Tell all these old bitches they ain't danger
The thing on my hip whip bitches in to shape
That's what I call a fucking waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what?
I think ya got your story screwed up
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough
[?]

So if it's all love, show me love then
'Cause you hating on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie low, that's how I'm pulling up
Just 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue, I hold the gun
And we all know you ain't that tight
I smack you and the bitch that you act like
I started getting money, bitches upset
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair [?]
Come through shinning with them Rollies [?]
Headshot, headshot, tell 'em cold case
Ain't no bitches feeling like this, [?]
I don't trust no nigga, I don't feel no bitch
Whole life been through some fucked up shit
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
[?]



[Hook]
Hundred band, hundred band
I'm 'bout my bread I got to get this shmoney man
They fuck with my shmoney I'm sending them shots I watch them do the running man

Pussy got him on the jugg he gonna re-up and come right back

[Verse 1]
No I'm not cool, cause bitch I'm bool
And I'm been jacking that ever since school
So don't be a fool
Run up on me got mechanics with tools
And they ain't scared to lose
They had me on snooze
Now when I host it's is a zoo
When the host is a zoo
Got me a check I got a check
Feeling so blessed
Doing a lot more than what they expect
I'm in my prime everything in effect
And I'm so cool with that

[Verse 2]
He want to dab in this pussy but I don't think he get the picture
He ask me what I want I tell him make me look like sub-zero sister
I'm talking that ice just ignore the price or I might just dismiss ya
Don't do broke niggas ain't no joke nigga cause the pussy delicious
Bitches mad at me cause I'm on my shit
I know they doubted me cause I used to strip
Blew on IG on some regular shit, then she to TV on some degular shit

[Hook]
Hundred band, hundred band

Pussy got him on the jugg he gon' re-up and come right back

I'm startin' to lose my patience, weak bitches hatin'
Bitches throwing subs like I won't kick your face in
Baby mama's mad 'cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy, I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
"Cardi why you feisty?" Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me? Your nigga wanna wife me
You think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face, rde that shit nicely
Set his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do? You and you and you
I feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal? I'm 'bout to start the hill
The wig is comin' off, shit 'bout to get real

[Verse 2: Casanova]
Got beef with Cardi B? I'm poppin' off
Shit get hectic? I'ma drop it off
Oh you shinin'? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all
You was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starvin'
I gotta feed all 'em
I'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch
What they thought switched 'cause we both got rich?
Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Shit, that bitch six three and she bodied
Superman calves, and her shoulder somethin' retarded
I ain't backin' down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You gon' have to knock me out if you think I'ma forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple niggas and they had you out in a coffin
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor prayin', like, "Sorry for your, loss"
Throw dirt on my name, you better pop off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box off
I'm Cardi B, east coast newest contender
5'3" lookin' good with the nails bananas
Freddy Kruger on these bitches, I cut their lights off
Should have read the memo, Cardi B pops off



I gave you more than I give myself
So loyal to you that I betray myself
Well I guess Ima wither away

You a snake and you chose to slither today
I gave my all my love and my trust but
I guess my all just wasn't enough
Yeah there's something about you I can't help it
But Ima do for myself I'm being selfish

Babe your melody is the voice I need makes me skip a beat yeah
And baby you know it yeah
But it's hard to show it
See the one I love used to be in clubs used to fuck with thugs yeah
And I can't expose it yeah cause she already know it yeah
But why don't you ask me
Why is it so hard to fall in love
Why don't you ask me
Why can I never ever ever try
Why don't you ask me
Why everything is going this way
Why don't you ask me
I guess we don't know
They say the one that you truly love hurts you the most
Now the one that I truly love hurt me the most
Now the one that you truly love is hurting you the most
I guess I'll never know
Why I got so cold
It's not your fault

Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish Withering away as I gaze at the sky looking at his face and all the pain it's caused me
I ask why
Didn't I love
Didn't I give you more than I ever gave myself
What do you wish cause that part of me no longer exist
This time I'm first, I'm picking me
I finally learned to be selfish



[Hook]
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'

[Verse 1]
Look, show you bitches how to do this shit
Stand back while I demonstrate
Pussy worth like a million dollars
I think your nigga got expensive taste
I'm not a bum bitch, I'm a boss bitch
You sideline, I'm center stage
I don't even get involved with it
If it don't make me cum or it don't get me paid
If it's not the money then it's "poof, be gone"
Steal your man with my Doobie on
Whole team full of bad bitches
And that Louis Vuitton our uniform
24 karat my grills, I do what I want
Bitch, fuck how you feel
Fuck a whole check up all on my nails
I pull up in foreign and cut in my wheel, byes, bitch

[Hook]
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'

Look, I'm not a rider chick, I'm a driver chick
I could come get you instead
I hope all of your homies got money, nigga
'Cause all of my bitches got bread
Look, got a home girl out the west coast
Swear to God, I love that bitch
Ask about us, any club
They gon' tell you we run that shit
I'm like the strip club, Mariah Carey
Dominican, Halle Berry
Hair be laid, bills be paid
Still put bread on my nigga commissary
If I want somethin', it's, "Whatever, cop it"
Balenciaga, tell 'em check the closet
Heard you fuckin' for that extra change
That's why that pussy got that extra mileage, I be rollin'

[Hook]
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'

To use you and abuse you
And I'm gonna live
And I'm gonna win (haha)

[Hook]
They out here looking for revenge
All day, all night
See me not once but twice
All looks and no fights
See me doing me got em wondering how a bitch came a took flight
They talk about me all night
God damn they must be tight
They looking for revenge

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's not my fault tho
I swear I just do me and bitches be sick, bitches got sore throats
Last year I was on the pole
Now you can catch ya girl on the road
Damn near 15k a show
I think some bitches need to know, yeah
Cause I don't brag much
But shit really be a blow
When I got bitches that's coming for me like we on the same level, that's a no
These bitches is nowhere near my level
Can't even fit em in my schedule
Yeah your girl is overbooked
You really think my attention's gonna catch you
Mixtape been out for 3 weeks
And already charting on Billboards
For really think that shit was free
All I gotta say is "thank you Lord"
This is for the ones that was doubting me
And said I was never gon be shit
All of a sudden they proud of me
And wanna be hopping on my dick
They six, six, six
Yeah, sick, sick, sick, cause they know wassup
I'm usually always humble but right now I really don't give a fuck
Some niggas be hating hard
Why is it because you didn't buck?
Cause you didn't get the time a day?
And I left ya lame ass in the dust
Oh man, oh man
If you hittas pulling straight fam on
They saying I'm the next superstar
Co-signed by Lee Daniels
Im just tryna play this game clever
I'm just tryna do that shit right
So I hit em wit that "Foreva"
Ran down on that bitch twice

[Hook]
They out here looking for revenge
All day, all night
See me not once but twice
All looks and no fights
See me doing me got em wondering how a bitch came a took flight
They talk about me all night
God damn they must be tight
They looking for revenge

[Cardi B]
Know I don't really brag much, but bitches better stop fucking playing with me like I can't stunt on a bitch
Like, like y'all think, y'all think I'm playing with my pussy all day long or something
You know what, bring that back
Mm

[Verse 2]
I know some bitches in the Bronx that wanna be me a little
But stop on learning how to suck and fuck and live free a little
And bitch know your worth, don't show it all, let em see a little
And if he ain't bout the money, hit the brakes, but do speed a little
I remember having no money, sleeping at my ex house
My mom couldn't take me at the time, so she had to kick me out
But I'm not mad at her one bit, cause I don't think I would've took this route
I had to go get it on my own
Im just glad I figured it out
Like I been through a lot
And it wasn't easy to escape
That's why it really bothers me when motherfuckers got something to say
And just to set the record straight
[?] to stop a J
If they ain't SwiftOnDemand, then they ain't help me in no way
I swear they be wanting so much credit
But don't wanna give none when it's due
Slept on ya girl for so long
Now wanna come hopping out the blue
Nah bruh shit don't work like that
Well at least it don't in my book
Cause if you fuck with me hard, and I fuck with you, then there's no other way to look
Imma hit em again and again
Get so much music, it go to ya friend
Hitting a tour and the shade gon end
Hmm that's why they looking for revenge

[Intro]
You know, people underestimated me
And making me feel like I'm never gonna amount to shit because I used to be a stripper
It feels like I'm getting whipped in the back, with words
But you know what?
They don't see the bigger picture
I had to feed myself, I had to feed my family
But you know what?
Just here me out

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive me for my sins
Forgive me for the crazy shit I wish I never did
I'm simply just a young hood girl tryna win
I just want it all, and I gon' pretend
Like I ain't never had to suck a dick to pay my rent
I'm tryna get my family out the hood and new cribs
I wanna finish paying my mothers new whip
I do it for a cause, so understand the kid
I want my little girl to go to school in Fort Lee
Schools in the hood, got him crazy, man he three
And it's fucked that it ain't how it's supposed to be
He should be counting 123's and ABC's
And momma used to beat my ass like every week
That's because she can't have nothing but love for me
I wanna spoil her so much, oh lord please
That's my everything
My everything, my family

[Hook]
You know what?
Even when I was stripping, like bitches was worried 'bout the wrong things
Oh they want red bottoms, they want the biggest cars
Like I'm worried 'bout my father stop cab driving
Before he turn sixty, and my mom stop being a cashier before she fifty like
That's why I'm working so hard out here
That's why I go so hard
Not for me, but for them though
You feel me?

[Verse 2]
Note to self, for my sister Hennessy
Try and go to school, finish up and get degrees
Don't be fucking trick niggas, just so you can eat
That's the shit I did and it really makes me weak
I would close my eyes, dying for it to be over
The thought of a stranger inside, I just can't be sober
Dirty ass breath, breathing all over my shoulders
Ain't no bitch gon' tell you that, just respect the soldier
And I wanna tell my dad, you don't gotta cab
Drive for two whole weeks just to make a stack
You don't gotta drive no more, I'm gon' change all that
I put that on my everything, I'm gon' pray for that

[Outro]
You know when I was a little girl I used to tell my mom
"Hey mom, when I grow up, I'm gonna buy you a house, I'm gonna buy you a car"
Until I turned eighteen, it's like damn, I can't even get me my own apartment
So, it's just like, now that I'm in this position I'm gonna
I'm gonna take full advantage of it
Like oh my gosh, I can't wait till I get to surprise my mom
Like, "Hey, I didn't went to college, but look, look at me mom, look at me now, look, look mom, look, look at your house, This is your house! Not mines, but yours, and I bough it for you!"

Cardi
Josh X

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I see the pain in your eyes
And truth is, only the strong survive
And you still here, so from here you only gon' rise
Spread them wings so they can tell you how far you gonna fly
You don't gotta pop them pills
I know just how you feel
I know there's a lot of fake love
But there's love that's actually real
But that can't stop you now
You're already on the battle field
Took everythin' that came your way
Almost at the top of the hill, fly, baby, fly

[Hook: Josh X]
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Don't be so quick to just give in
If you give up now, how you gon' win?
I know them stressful nights made you and the pills best friends
I know it feels good, but this shit just got to end
I'm countin' on you, boo
Put this peer pressure on you
If I overcame that shit
I know you can make it too
I don't want to see you lose
There's other ways to heal that bruise
I know you can make it to see
What's at the end of the solution, shine, baby, shine

[Hook: Josh X]
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

[Bridge: Cardi B]
Don't jump now
I come for you
I'm here for you

[Hook: Josh X]
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

[Outro: Cardi B]
I love you



Yo where the fuck was you at?

And if I catch you in the club I don't give a fuck what club it is Ima fuck you up there too

I be stylin' on these niggas
Stylin' on these hoes
Grind up a check, got it at the store
Runnin' through the checks till the club close (racks)
Stylin' on these niggas
Stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these bitches
Stylin' on these hoes

[Verse 2]
I gotta get it
I need to check it, I need the bread
That's why I'm workin'
And I'm in the Benz 'cause you in the bed
Bitches is sleepin'
Fuck is they thinkin'?
What is you doin'?
Then they be mad
Lookin' at me
Like I did something to 'em
Bank account on racks
Pussy still on drip drop
Put this pussy on wax
Took me straight to the tip top
I might race with the wraith
Ain't no space in the safe
Next bitch in my face
Catchin' case, catchin' case
But anywho, anywho
Birkin bag, Jimmy Choos
All my bitches say "Aaw!"
All my guns go "Boom!"
More guns than the warden
Smack hoes with my Jordans
Pussy's floodin', New Orleans
Kiss a bitch I'm gorgeous
Never been no pussy
Yo, I'm always with the shits
I ain't never been no dirty broad
But now I'm filthy rich
Bitch bitch!

[Hook]
Stylin' on these hoes
I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes
I'm stylin' on these hoes
...

Cardi B: Well you know I've been writing rhymes and I've been into music ever since I was in high school. But you know when you young you have these dreams of becoming this big star or being an artist. But your dreams start getting crushed by priorities and bills you know. After I got kicked out of my house when I was 18, its like I didn't have 200 dollars to invest in a studio session like I had to pay bills I had to pay my rent. Now that I'm making that shmoney, its like, why not invest on my dreams that I always dreamt of. You know what I'm saying. You got to follow your dreams, like fuck you mean

[Intro]
Money bag
Give me the money bag
Money bag
I'm lookin' like a money bag
Money bag
Money bag

[Pre-Hook]
I do the Maybach on Monday
Ferrari Friday
This is sweet pussy Saturday
That's just what [?] say
I say "bae, it's a snack"
He say it's the entrée
With them pretty ass switch
You look like Beyoncé

[Hook]
Lookin' like
Money bag, money bag, money bag (uh)
Money bag, money bag, money bag (woo!)
Money bag, money bag, money bag (get it)
Money bag, money bag, money bag
[?] from the front, I got it behind me
And I park my Bentley truck on my Versace driveway
...

These bitches salty, they sodium
They jelly, petroleum
Always talkin' in the background
But never come to the podium
Chef Cardi B, I'm cookin' up
I see your bitch at the stove again
While ya hoes were sleepin' on me
I made 40 bags by 4 pm



[Intro]
Gangsta !
Cardi !
B !

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 1]
Pull up like huh?
They looking like what?
Heads turn left and right, they wonder who's her?
Cardi B, duh
Bitch don't front
You on my Gram all day, don't play dumb
Came up from the slums
The dirty, dirty Bronx
Where niggas quick to clip your shit, no fair ones
You gotta keep a gun, but beef to me is fun
I never back down, been this way since day one

[Pre-Chorus]
They shit on me before, thought I was just a stupid hoe
They tight now, they realize they was sleeping on gold
Took me one year man, and now I'm doin' shows
Now they wanna take pics with me, hold on let me pose
Believe me, I easily can do a bitch greasy
I'll give it to you just how you like it girlll
Cardi B in full effect, couple bitches upset
Couple niggas wanna hit it and they can't so they stressed

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 2]
Cardi in tune, bitches make room
Test me? The gat goes CLICK, CLACK, BOOM
Gangsta Bitch, oooh, Volume 2
Cop somethin' mean, when it start you hear that VROOM
Pull up to your side, 30 deep right?
Stuntin' on my ex, he thirsty for a reply
Sick, sick, sick
Call my phone, it's CLICK
Had me fucked up when you was fucking with that bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Making power moves
Goin' 50 on 'em
Same ones that played me
High-siddity on 'em
Back to back with it, goin' Drizzy on 'em
Now they tight, they gotta watch me make a milli on 'em

[Outro]
Ha-Ha !
Yo, yo, Remember, remember nigga when you told me that I was gonna work in that strip club Divas on 177th in the Bronx for the rest of my life? Well guess what nigga? Now i'm the fucking diva
Shit
Fuck outta here
GANGSTA!



Haitian V: Wha- come one man!

Haitian V: Cardi, why you keep me waiting like that all the time? The garbage man - they - they asked me if I live here, I say no. Why you leave me outside like that?

They tell Beyonce and Kim Kardashian - they say listen it’s only one and it has to go to Haitian for him to give it to his girlfriend

Cardi B: Nobody tell you to do all that. You coulda - you coulda went to Foredom. You coulda went to Foredom and get a goddamn ring

Haitian V: Let’s stop this - this garbage foolishness. Okay baby?

Cardi B: What I told you about calling me baby? Like don’t call me baby. I don’t like when you call me baby like you just make us look crazy in public, like stop calling me that. Stop calling me that

Haitian V: Cardi

Cardi B: Don’t call me baby

Haitian V: Cardi, why you talking about I can’t call you baby? What I’m supposed to call you? Homie
