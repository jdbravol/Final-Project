One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A

You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free



You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none



Aye, aye,  JC
'Sup Enron
Ain't that Snoop Dogg over there?
That nigga with that blue coat on?
Yeah
Yeah, oh yeah, that's that nigga
Nigga roll up on the side of him, man
Roll your window down
Man, hand me my motherfucking Glock man, give me another clip
Cause I'm gonna smoke this fool
Yeah roll the windows down
Yeah, okay there you go
Aye man, you Snoop Dogg?
Snoop, Snoop Doggy Dogg?
Man he's Snoop Dogg
Nigga man
Get that nigga man
Man get up fool man, get up man, don't be trying to run man
Get up on that fool man, I don't give a fuck
What set you got now?
Fuck you nigga
Yeah nigga, what's up?
Nigga
Yeah mothafucka
Yeah nigga, one less nigga
Yeah nigga, you's a dead motherfucker now

As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
And will I be the G that I was?
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed

Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me

21st eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me

Some things, sons they just won't change
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law

Little G's tryna creep, on the East with it
But they don't know once they get close
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
They keep buckin and it went too far
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged


I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three motherfuckers dead now I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case really you could see
I crack the Mac back and pop off rollin
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow? On my door? What the fuck yo!
See these niggas proceed to speed
So fulfill the need to leave or you'll hear my enemies goin...


I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth God... damn!
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat
You never seen a thug like dis
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact I could be "Beast of the East" motherfucker!
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, cause my peoples
Is screaming that we need more for fun or it's illegal
They see it happens state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin L.A., all I hear the ese's say - they go...


Snoop Dogg, him bust gunshots
Skateboard P, they say him bust gunshots
DPG, them bust gunshots

I'm tired of hearin all that bullshit
When you gon' play some of that good shit... damn

Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick
For those who don't like it, eat a dick
But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this

Lodi Dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
For all my doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day

I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a strech, up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said "Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?"
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard!"
Well that's true! That's why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, "oh no"
I went back in, "I forgot my Indo!"
This was a girl playing hard-to-get
So I said "What's wrong?" cause she looked upset

It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me

Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother steps then says to me "Hi!"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, "What was goin on?"
I tried to break it up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her!"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either!"
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying

"Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay"

And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born!
I said "Cheer up!" and I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!"
She said, "No you're not!" then she starts cryin
I says I'm 19, she says, "Stop lyin!"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"

Yeah, uh, tick-tock ya don’t stop
And to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
Yeah, n'ya tick-tock ya don’t stop
And to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
Biatch!

Fake niggas won't get bags from me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?

From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock - oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don't speak at all
You might 'scape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Flip it, zip it, let it fly
If it's good, it's gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain't the one
We don't even smoke that shit for fun!

Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though

Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like 20 ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck

Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

So if you think you got the bomb shit

Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's Paid
So what you wanna do?

She too fly for words
And where I'm at now I'm too high for birds
Shorty, what you think about my return
Cuz what he think about it ain't my concern
I ain't come for you, I came for your Missus
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players
Well okay, I do it for the riches
But in the meantime and in-between time
Shorty right there gon' get it if she with it
If she ain't, then I know her partner down
Cuz her partner throwing shots every time I turn around
And her partner bringing partners every time I come to town
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right there
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs
And when I come down he can bring it back, word

I came to cut right now
Bigg Snoop Dogg and I came to get down
Yes, I'm internationally known
Libra lovin' make you moan and groan
Burn my gas like race cars
Two bad broads with the bass on
I never met a girl that I'd wait for
I seal my deal like Jay does
All that and then some
Pimp real for real when I win some
I remember what you're thinking
Black shades on, drinking while you're blinking
Something fly, white limousine
Make a clean getaway
I loved your clothes, what you about
The way you let it out

She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches N Cream
Uh oh there she go
That's that look all on her face

Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it wit ya
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor
And all about this chronic leaf is what in for
So give your parents my apology for me again or
Get high like we Cheech and Chong
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs
Roll up so we can all...

Killer Cali is what we blow
OG nigga from way down low
Known for banging the blue C rag
Started off smoking nothing but Zags
Popping P's, chopping trees

All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television
Table full of vegetation so you just might smell nigga
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be
East Side Long Beach where I'm from
Bring your girls, all y'all come
Give me some, now give her some
It's big Mac, I love to have fun
You are, you are the one
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1
Break it down, lay it down
Baby work that body like
At the pad, acting bad
Baby what that party like?
Moving so schizophrenic
Baby pull down your panties
Let the Doggy Dog ram it
I cram it, understand it
Back room that's my bedroom

Close the door, smoke, oh fasho

When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Having money and blowing hella chronic
Smoke I'm stunting
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running
Sounding like a dinosaur empty stomach rumbling
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb
Stuffing kush in Raw cones, playing Megaman 3
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston
So why get caught up
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up
In sewing circles with them hoes
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeaking when we screwing

Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you in
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue and

Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gotta have it
I lay back in the cut retain myself
Think about the shit, and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on another
Mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'till the next episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell ya the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I, make, hits, every single day
With, that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut, motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

Boy it's gettin' hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg on the mic I'm about as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the, chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm fin to fuck a bitch, what's her name it's Luke
You tried to see me, on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes I'mma O.G
You can't see my homey Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G, cuz that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the Coupe
The Lexus, flexes, from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist hoes, they wanna get with this
Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, beeeitch!

Ahhhh, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop, Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut, like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him, gimme the ass
Cuz they know about the shit that we be goin through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin up
And they be knowin bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being seein'
No I'm not European bein all I can
When I put the motherfuckin mic in my hand, and
You don't understand when I'm kickin
Cuz Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, cuz I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dum, diddy-dum here I come
With the gat, and the guitar will strum, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin, I'm gon catch you then I peel your cap
Snapped back, relax
Ya better not be slippin with them D's on the '83 Cadillac
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
Gz up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this



Everytime I go out
I'm blowing that smoke out
I buy it, don't even know the price
I talk cause I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's about to go down
We fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
All we need up in heres hoes now
Roll one up, clean the ride, case them hoes wanna jump inside

Got a joint filled with quality shit
My bottom bitch smoking with me, niggas talk shit
All of 'em shrimp
I'm a big fish
Roll a joint, lick it once, tell you hit this
Groupies on my dick
Several kushes on my hit-list
In and out these niggas bitches
Smoking tree and not to mention hustling, trying to mind my business
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skipping
Yeah I hear what they saying, just be to high to listen
'Bout my money, tripping if I even fold it wrong
You ain't smoking this good
If it's fire, tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round to roll it all
Or say fuck it and cuff it 'til I go smoke with Dogg
I show off, I show off, I show off
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off
Keep the money coming in and the papers rolled up
And ain't worried about a hating nigga, they get no love


I go green like I was Arch Bishop Don Juan
And blow circles around you suckas like a marathon
My gym teacher told me but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework and now I'm in detention
It should be suspension
This is my audition
So play your position, get the picture I envision
A barracuda fishing, she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain, and glory in my inventory
My SATs my little bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancing on stage at the talent show
We flossing, my clothes, my chain, and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can you see my telescope
Principal say she want to see me cause she smell my smoke
'Bout my money, tripping even if I fold it wrong
Blowing zones with Wiz because this is the protocol




Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence
For the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes
Know what I'm saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have I never will
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes
You'll never go platinum!"
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga

We’d like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

It's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door

Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off, shake off, now take off your
Clothes, and quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that something?
Talk shit and I'm dumping
I had the fuckin' whole block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, It's on and popping
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping
I wanna see some panties dropping
I'm coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin out blues, I’m upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I’m head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin out looney like O-Dog

And it don't stop, and it don't quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough

Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hows with a fat dick
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
Then I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I smoke chronic til the day that I die



Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas

"Make 'em bleed" is the motto that I live by
If you fuck with me, it's a must, you die
Them niggas might go running, but them niggas can't hide

KLC rock the beat, hitting hard like Burt
Niggas in the Nolia know him as "Big Hurt"
Just like Soulja Slim, he'll put you in the dirt
And have your picture on front of a t-shirt
And when I make moves, I got a hundred niggas with me
Just in case a nigga out there trying to get me
All my niggas is down to squeeze the trigger

Coverin' up the world, right
Listen, look

You ain't trying to hot box with me, I swig hard liquor
Going down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backing down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk driving, trying to stack my loot
While other rappers getting "Treated Like a Prostitute"
So check the SoundScan

All I wanna be was a G, ha!
My whole life, nigga please, ha!
Breaking off these motherfuckin keys, ha!
Let's get these motherfuckin G's, ha!
Nigga you don't wanna fuck with this
Oh no, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezee bay-bay
You jocking my style? You so crazy
Dre say, ain't "No Limit" to this
As long as we drop gangsta shit
Look here bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it "Doggystyle"
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental
Lincoln Continental
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago

I get this pussy everywhere that I go
Ask the bitches in your hood cause they know
I get this pussy everywhere that I go
Ask the bitches in your hood cause they know

Bitch please! Get down on your god damn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed
Look, you fuckin with some real O.G's, bitch please
Bitch please get down on your motherfuckin' knees
We came to get the motherfuckin' cheese
Yeah, you fuckin' wit' some real OG's, you dick tease

Bitch, please! Now what you need to do is
Diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks
Oh, you like setting niggas up and getting them locs?
A cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Then a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg I'm movin!
Ain't nothing to it but to get to groovin
You've been waiting on a nigga like me
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm trying to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang

I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho
I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho

Aiyyo.. aiyyo aiyyo!
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. til the day I D-I-E



Six million ways to die, choose one

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Aiyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game"
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up witchu I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton and Watts see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
{"Pump pump!"} Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
6 feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

The cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon
'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
I won't leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta
Now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X
Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!

How many hoes in your motherfuckin group
Wanna take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your ho, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and don't really give a sheeit

And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done

So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket loc
'Cuz Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow

And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow

This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas

This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz



I’m smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled
I’m rolling every gram I own
Don’t gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

Concentrated, everyday I’m faded
Trees prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed ‘em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the Z-I zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black card, sack of dank
High School nigga what the fuck you think?
I’m passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I’m high as a muthafucker


Sun roof open, smoking while I’m rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Joint roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her head
She saw the crib, she know that I’m balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I’m talking Rick Ross big
And now when we shop we don’t care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga thats boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubberbands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga out here getting bread, why knock it


We welcome you to High School
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to highschool
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
Get high to it



Yo Doc what up my nigga
Snoop Dogg, it is what it is mane
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
I think it's time for me and you to just, tone it down a bit
Come on...

Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in the City of God, you feel me?
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called 'pop' by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
So if you get back to the streets you go right back in
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just tryin' to keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop

Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind – can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?
Please call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life

Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked you "What you run for?" and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin' like they hate to see you gung ho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun, though
But you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean, imagine we said 'fuck this shit'
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growing up in the jail, dumb
Happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you 50 million records
Worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other?
All a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
He fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind – can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?
Please call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life
Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind – can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?
Please call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life

Imagine, imagine
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Can you imagine?
Can you imagine?
Can you imagine?
Imagine, imagine

"In the name of Allah, in the name of God
The beneficent, the merciful
The one God to whom all praise is due
Regardless of land, labor, or title
No matter what name you call God by
Whenever life seems hard
Everybody know that you must﻿ talk to God"



I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys

Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in - tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you needing
You wanna breathe? I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping VIP they can't get in

Cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys

Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

Now you stepping wit a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras, just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncer cars
Shiieet, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys

Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
She likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

Mami, mamasita, have you ever - flown on G5s
From London to Ibiza, You gotta have cake
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena

Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
And her pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys

Don't think about it, boy leave her alone



Yeah man what's going on man it's really really pimpin' up in here man
I know you ain't seen pimpin' in a long time man, I've been MIA

Cause they got to step they game up, you know what I mean


Break it down bitch, let me see you back it up
Now turn around bitch, put that ass on a nigga


Bitch wanna act like she ain't never been with fast lane pimpin' on
Nails with the French tip potato chip yup with a French dip
Say she wanna French kiss all on my diz-nick
It's cool, go on and break fool if you have to
What which you won't do bitch I'mma slap you
Stay in line ho it's a pimp affair
If you down to get low I can take you there
But you can't fake once you hit the gate
Shake till it ache, work that birthday cake
You say you wanna make it ho
Well quit bullshittin' and get naked ho
Now you always got to be hot and vicious
So move them biscuits and hit them tricks bitch
Now you got about a minute to fix this
Cuz I'm trying to find a bitch that's bootylicious


P-U-S-S-Y, run a world, I'm the girl in the flesh ah
Lookin' for a nigga that will suck me like a blow pop
Run that dick to the door, do me baby don't stop
Same nigga talkin' all that shit
Just a little bitch, little balls, little dick
Let me show you how to work your tongue like a hurricane
We ain't here to play no games, baby give me everything
I know you like me when I drop it down low
Show it from the back, look back, let it roll
Drop it to the floor like a g-bitch supposed to
Shake it shake it shake it make a nigga go postal
But that's for fucking with a Miami girl
Get your man, take his money, and then buy the world
So nigga don't front, cuz fat wallets and big dicks is all I want






T'was the night before Christmas
And all through the hood
Nope, it was all good
The stocking was hung on my big fat dick
We was hoping to get some of that good shit
From old jolly Saint Nick
The children were snuggled up, sleeping in bed
My bitch on my jock, giving holiday head
When outside my crib there rolled such a clatter
I stuck my head out and yelled "What tha fuck is the matter?!"
Then a fat, red pimp got out of his ride
It was perfectly clear he was from the North Side
"Yo Santa what's up? Did you bring me some chronic?"
And Tanqueray gin I can mix with my tonic?
He said "ho, ho, ho" and opened his sack
It was stuffed full of indo, had to take a step back
"Is this for the Dogg? Did you bring this for me?
To blaze with my hoes and my closest homies?"
He just nodded his head, his eyes about shut
It was then that I knew that Saint Nick was fucked up
He ate all my motherfuckin' cookies
I left on the plate
Then he went to the fridge
And he ate, and he ate, and that fat motherfucka ate
And when he was done
When the cupboard was bare
He packed his shit up and got outta there
"Good night Doggy Dogg!" he said from the sky
"Merry Christmas to all you motherfuckers
And to all a good high"
Merry Christmas
From the Dogg Pound
And everybody have a happy new year, ho ho ho



Yo what's Crip-a-lat'n, this big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be




Yeah, this is another story about dogs
For the dog that don't pee on trees is a bitch
So says Snoop Dogg
So get your pooper scooper, 'cause the nigga's talkin shit
Roof! Roof! Roof! Roof! Roof!

I'm sippin' on Tanqueray
With my mind on my money and my mouth fulla gan-jay
R-A-G to the motherfuckin' E
Back with my nigga, S-N-double-O-P
Rage in effect I just begun to rock
Hey yo Rage, would you please drop some gangsta shit?
I rock ruff and stuff with my Afro Puffs
Handcuffed as I bust, 'bout to tear shit up
Oh, what? Did ya think I, didn't ever think I
Would be the one to make you blink eye
I'm catchy like pink-eye
Never will there ever be another like me
Um, you can play the left, 'cause it ain't no right in me
Out the picture, out the frame, out the box I knock 'em all
Smack 'em out the park, like A Friendly Game of Baseball
Grand slam, yes, I am
Kickin' up dust and I don't give a goddamn
'Cause I'm that lyrical murderer, pleading guilty
You know from my skills I'm about to be–
Filthy, large, Rage in charge
You know what's happenin', don't try to play Raj
This ain't no rerun, see hon', don't you wanna be one
However, Rage'll wreck ya, 'cause I'm def
I kick my vocals, I loc yo, coast to coast or local, uh
I'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa
Puffin' stuff, ayo Snoop, you're up
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck

This is just a small introduction to the G-funk era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryin' to be like me
Ever since I put it down with the D-R-E

Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
Searchin through the yard with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the business in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it doggystyle, all the while we do it doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin' hoe!
He fucked the fleas off a bitch
He shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone
And if there's any left over
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home

Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga
I ain't bullshittin, one of y'all niggas gotta get it
Man, I got to piss
Breath test?



Why is there suddenly a nigga trippin' when I do it?
Why do everybody else gon' have a war, have beef
Within the music, talkin' about differences and it's ok
It's music it's hip-hop it's groundbreaking
When I do it, it's war

In the city watch how I'm getting head with it
She do it with no hands and I be ghost whippin'
Oops I think I meant ghost riding
When I get that vet watch how she let me slide in
In that pussy and you know I'm the livest
Introduced known to beat it up no crime man
And I might leave your bae crying
I'm so stressed out man all the homies fall in
And if she let me hit, the homies all can
And nigga if I'm eating it's all in one pan
'Cause I'mma be as hungry as the last man
I keep it G like a crip in the '80s
And man I beat your ass like a nigga in slavery
They say they're trying to help me but it sound like hate to me
A young nigga, but I'm wise like Dr. King
On my own shit, get your own ends
Niggas think they gettin' handouts 'cause we damn friends
Nigga put that spoon down better use your hands
Better get that grind right before you life ends
And I ain't never had no love for a fake friend
Or a fuck nigga, better duck nigga
Better hope one of them things don't get stuck in ya

Slip this with the crip stick
Itty bitty nigga with the slick shit
In a room full of misfits
Plug it in, let it bang, yea my shit bitch
Get bread like bisquick
You're a soft ass nigga with a face full of lipstick
Let me show you how a crip dip
Get ships and flips and take low trips
I sipps that shit ain't talking 'bout lean
Down to Mississippi and New Orleans
Word as a motherfucka, let me verb that
Snoop Dogg is a hog, yea I heard that
You deserve that swerve that 'lac
Make it bang, let it go, bring that back
I blew they brain, nephew yea do that thang

Living life in the maze it's amazing
So high I can levitate it's crazy
I feel like I'm the nigga in the matrix
I'm sipping codeine I feel like I'mma patient
I stay dosed down off a medical blunt this ain't new
Cop a qp I blow it with lil Snoop
Blowing smoke out the roof, hoes know we the truth
Get the bitch loose than I make her do what it do
I'm chopping real game, other niggas is goose
And when I pass by the bitch she gon' know we the truth
We brought base in your face to proof
The realest nigga out bitch give me the juice
They never hate a nigga when he spittin' the truth
I gotta keep it real gotta stick to my roots

Tu-Tune in, you know my slang
Me and my niggas doing our thing and we all gon' win
Fucking these models and fucking they friends
Got more hoes than Snoop and Prince
Pimpin' nigga, look at my hands
Gold rings on my fingers
Young nigga and I'm hella dangerous
Like a lethal injection, ballers on it
Yea that's me section, getting money
Yea that's the only objection
Chrome everywhere so I see my reflections
West West, hold it down for Texas
Yellow diamonds on my necklace
Pretty bitches getting naked
Young nigga living reckless
Like 21 guns for protection

Been done with that fast life
So it was on to the thug life
Ain't no bet, but I could never love my wife
Like I love my life I never love ya twice
I fell in love one night still lost in the days in a major way
I be blazed for days, like Johnny
We savvy, real nigga say savvy
Looking for them bitches take them at a track meet
Deep dig bandit she run into my canyon
Dabbin' blowing like a candle, savvy
Woodgrain whippin' in the valley
Real OG I'm nothing like my daddy
Few kids on the way I'm happy
Raw dog, and I'm learning with a passion
Ohh, didn't y'all go to school
I'm reachin' and preachin' and teachin' the youth
They all in my business I'm feeling like Snoop
But I'm more like Pac learn a life lesson but I might get shot
I'm spreading the message that's all that I got
We pray for progression and stick to the plot
I'm feeling like Yoda my knowledge is hot

I see myself changing the world
Because my thought patterns are so opposite of the norm
So I will have to change the world
Or I will have to be changed by the world



West Coast, it's time to stand up nigga
We gon' unite 'round this motherfucker one time
I'm callin' every real Crip nigga
And every real B-Dogg, to the table right now
Yeah, we gon' push a real line right now
See if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit

Have you ever seen 100,000 rip riders from the side
Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies
On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues
Niggas gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
These suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
Never flip-flop, 20 crippin' til I drop

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip

Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5
With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview
Niggas see clear through, they know that it's Game
Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang
So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"
I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggas locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One's on
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked
Red and blue rag tied in a knot
With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out

Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Ca-rip

I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go
Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4
We just dippin', one Bloodin' one Crippin'
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side
So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside

Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet
Stop, and C-Walk to the beat
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
Eastside LBC, gun in my hand
It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
We just - slip and slide out, we rip and ride out
Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop



Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish
And it's comin from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

See me man, I'm nothin like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin
Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin
I'm livin that boss' life
The hoes come runnin when they see me comin
I'm livin that boss' life
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Timbs and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla
If she a baller, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin out the Doggfather
'less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor

Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs

W-Balls, it's your main man DJ E-Z Dick
About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg

A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Real, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Har'ron rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big neck bone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't +Pull My Ho Card+
.. I fucked all your groupies
When you was doin time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
But I walk the mainline everytime I go down
You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style
.. I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for "1-8-7 on a cop"
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

It all boils down to the fact
It all boils down to the fact

Money, I get it, paper I got it
I got the dope
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Run up, ya get done up, I stay one up

If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worse than them devils
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em
But I'mma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'mma let the whole world see
Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
He better keep it Crippin, and slip his clip in
Cause these niggas trippin, this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga


Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Money, I get it, paper I got it

Jealous ass nigga



{*static*}
Pump Pump, Pump Pump, Pump Pump, Pump Pump

Let the motion of your body be the key, cuz we
Be the motherfuckin G Funk family
Now, I'll play the G in this deadly game
Snoop Dogg is the name Dogg Pound's the gang
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin nother
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standin on the corner, or bouncin in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
Cuz back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
Rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall
Can't none of y'all niggas see the Doggy Dogg
Cuz I'm one rude bwoy comin with the wickedness
So shut the fuck up, and listen while I'm kickin this

Blam blam, blam to dem all

Now you can look to the Sun, and spot the moon
And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
I come down with the wickedness
Close your eyes cuz you can't see me
I quit school cause of recess you fuckin B.G
I'm shakin up the party, like Lodi Dodi
Is he the dopest? Ya betta ask somebody
When, then, send, some gin
And a pack of zig zags now let the games begin
In nineteen-motherfuckin-ninety-three
I'm fuckin up every nigga known in the industry
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thang
You know who I am you know my motherfuckin name, who am I?
The behavior and the flavor that I found
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound


Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
I got somethin for them niggas in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a driveby in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when I come nigga I come wicked
Don't need no permission, motherfucker I'mma kick it
Niggas sweat my shit I wet em up with the biscuit
Lick em up shot, it don't stop, till dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, ridin on the next niggas jock
I'm strapped with my Glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot




Ayo, Jim, man, why don't ya…
Why dou don't you kick some of that, you know?
You know how you do it, man, it's a trip
People don't even believe we're together right now
You know the one I like, say it for me

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah

Goin' off of this, goin' off of that
With the Lizard king bumpin' in the back, how 'bout that?
Driftin', liftin', swiftin'
Coastin', testaroastin'
But the wheels won't stop
200 on the highway, fresh up off the block
He's a rider? Naw, he's a killer
Dresses in all black, but his hat says Steeler
Pedal to the metal
I gotta go hard, drive by and say hello
Hey, Fredwreck, you my mello
Now let me here what I sound like acapella
Bring it back just like this
Like a dog without his bone
Unlike a G with out his chrome; it's hard to imagine
The homie dog in a Jag
And he's checkin' for the checkered flag
Comin' in first, never in last
I never ever run outta gas
‘Cause I'm just too clean I do it upperclass
So fasten your seat belts
It's so hot it will even make heat melt
So get a bowl and roll and ride
Slip through the slip and slide

Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah

Need for speed, I'm tryin' to take the lead
Hold on, little homie, 'fore you run into the trees
I've seen things that I never would've saw before
Ayo, Jim, let 'em in, let 'em in
Open up, my back tire smokin' up
The whole street, and now the police
Wanna flash their lights
And chase the Dogg all night
But I won't pull over nor give up
‘Cause I just don't give a fuck
Yeah, I'm from the side, boy
Where we was born and raised straight up to ride, boy
Continuously, we get to an expeditiously
Keep the light on, East side on
Snoop Dogg and the Doors and, yeah, we 'bout to ride on

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm

On a mission and I'm fishing for my DJ Warren G

You know what I'm saying? Peace, G's up, hoes down



Snoopy

Groupies, on my head like a cufi
My nigga Kid Cudi

Call some ho's up and get some cutty cutty
What yo life like?
Mine's is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin'
That china white
My people love, the fans love me I'm all go
If you ain't showin' love, then what did you call fo'?
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
So alike and in need of my wife, smoke till I'm gone
Dog on the throne
I'm world-wide known I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it cause I can, I earn my spot
You see the plans, I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man, important to life
You understand while I'm puffin' on this gram

Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin'
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated
Steady wantin' freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holdin' the fam down and my close homie
The peoples who were there, when some sucka left me lonely
Phony, when you see a nigga don't approach me
Made it to the top baby, that's on me
Koch trying to claim that they made me
However you feel, another real fugazzi
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need be
I'm in another zone, no place for pussy, my nigga
Conyo to haters that don't know, low pro, how a nigga like from costo
The one fans loved, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O, smokin', eatin' Cheerios


Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king
And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it
All out in public
The people want to touch it
I need a blunt with the stuffin'
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out, post up at the house
With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies
Hollywood nice now
Everyone on me and on the blogs talk shit like they know me
Aww fool, take you niggas to school
"How to get rich and stay cool"
Snoopy D O Dub show you homie
Even with the critics and Feds all on me
I was tappin' all the chonies
Dog, but my folks call me Snoopy

Pony tail swangin' as I lay in the jacuzzi

Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing

Tae Bo, five, four, three, two, one
Working out, chiefing up, creeping up, keeping up
With the Joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals
In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it
Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho
Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho
Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob
Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool
Cause they know what I got
I got a bag of the Saturday pot
And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
What do you like?
When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life
Now light... the fatty, jump in my Cadi
Pull your seat back, yup, I know you need that
Let it flow, set it go, incredible
That ain't gold, laying low like 10 to 4, on the floor

My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing
Don't stop!

Don't even trip
Ain't really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinkin', “Why this ain't for sale?”
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails
She coning joints, I'm rolling weed up myself
Don't ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo 'bout to drop some shit, order those
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low
Boys hating, I'm just counting up the money I just made
And what I'm making make a nigga make a million dollars later
Smoking getting high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Ain't empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats
I roll a joint, you roll another one next
Can't even name a nigga colder than
Ain't pay for game that mean you stole it then
Know it's the bomb when you hold it in

My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing
Don't stop!



A friend indeed
Feeling like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditate and let it ride
Rock-a-bye beddy-bye
A friend indeed
More than jimming to
More than giving you
No prohibits to
You can have a listen too
I couldn't find no one else that I could give it to
And now that we on
I could put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And I'm still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
It's not that I'm dope and my style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said, "Snoopy, don't you ever cut your hair"
I was dazed and amazed
That's why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
When I was in school, I used to get cool grades
When I graduated, used to smoke two jays
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco
Then I got a Caddy sack, just like them vatos
Posted up six-one, yeah, that's the block though
Ride by slow and get your ass popped, though
Me and Geeda, Faith and Terry, that's when rump was enough
Can't forget Tim, Baby Dog and Half-Dead
Dre-Loc was a 20 Crip that showed me a lot of shit
But moving along, I went from a Camaro to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
Rolling through the neighborhood, checking my traps
As you get old, life like just might unfold
Can't settle, this might be untold
Twilight Zone, live life long
Smoke you a bone, and hit you a blunt
Buy you a zo', and roll you a jay
And put it in the E-I
And let's stay way fucked up til we D-I
All in together now if you agree
And lighters in the air, repeat after me
I’m too blowed, forever in a day
I love for oh's so
Cause everybody green ain't dro
Everybody can't smoke like we smoke
Give a dog a bone
I like trees that cypress hills grow
Roll up this shit, pimpin', it's on
Stoners worldwide singing this song



Meet me out, can you make it?
Please don’t make me lie to you, lady

See these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
So slow your roll, I'm In Control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted, if ya wanna, cuz I'm gonna
Grab my strap then clear the corner, beeotch!!

So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air

Now on a one, two, three who could it be
Comin with a grip of gangsta shit for ninety-three
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down all around
Cuz ain't shit for sale in the Coupe
With the beat flossin off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a callin for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin like hoes
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball

I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, that Daz is that nigga from back in the day
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre
Cuz I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be comin to my flat so I can tap that ass


You're headed my way, nigga you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin? I'm cappin shit up like a Western flick
The kingpin of the clique, top notch
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop
The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin to serve
The best Kurupt's era, peep the terror, cuz it's a murder fest
I smoke chronic every day, so what have we
Another motherfucker, gettin served like some cavy
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hellraisin like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin shit the fuck up
Slow your roll, like your legs was broken
Who's jokin? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die cuz I'm servin and
They can't fuck with or see me I'm mass murderous
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques


Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown
Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beef
Beatin' yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?





Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta MAC, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, "Break off some cheese"
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laaaid
On ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that


Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps
It's like that!


It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside
Eastside, yeah nigga we ride


They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun
I can't walk down the street without my gun, gun



Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence
For this small chronic break?
A-hah, yeah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Takin' bitches out to eat, and spendin' money on these hoes, YouknowhatI'msayin?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without the Bluenotes;
You'll never go platinum"
Hey Daz, give me a light, nigga



You know a nigga really don't wanna go to school today
Lemme call this bitch
Get my shit together

When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

This one's for the g's all black Chuck's on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees, I be with the boss dogg ya'll fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Rolling up grass, sold weed to half the staff, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last


We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put a little in a jay
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the libary
Got a new batch, some blue - booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day
It's a mind game like Kareem I seem to keep migraines
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass stay off day off Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a zip away
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang, what you want dog
Shit I'm on everythang


You niggas never had and you never will
You niggas never had and you never will
I said you niggas never had and you never will

You niggers still in high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holla at me when you graduate

Room 420


Niggas ain't hard like us
Niggas soft as doctors cotton swabs
You bitchin'?
Smoke somethin'



I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I

I'm not gon' rush the stroke

So she can get a sexual eruption
So I can get a sexual eruption
So we can get a sexual eruption
Sexual eruption, whoa, whoa

She might be with him but she's thinkin' 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the mall, we don't go out to eat, eat, eat
All that we ever do is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Smoke us a cigarette then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep

Sexual eruption

If you don't know by now, Doggy Dogg is a freak, freak, freak

I was all in the club, sippin' some Hen, smokin' on a blunt of dro
When I peeped this lil' ho out
I was all in the bar, wind drift up
Shawty Redd came on then she hit the floor now
With a see-through, dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep and a nigga know
If I take her home, with them wide ass hips
You damn right, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Big ass booty with a little bitty waist
I whisped in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?"
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shit
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck faces
But it wasn't no use for me to rush to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have a eruption


All the time, anytime



You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water

Narcotics vision of death merchant, shipping and handling yola I supply

Man that shit be comin in handy
I got that from the DB's, my cousin.. work dirty!
If you want 'em I got 'em; you here for the cop, you'd better be about your grip
Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast, don't suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucker
Real mannish with my Spanish
If ain't about no gouda, partner you can vanish
Don't get put up in yo' place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space


Now-A-Later's, gum drops, jelly beans
Lollipops and triple beams
Blue carpet, yeah that's the treatment
Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin it
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So gone on and get yourself a bar of this
No change man.. gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell they call it deez nutz
European front end with the french fries
How it feel man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin on some Bud Light
Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun


I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady
G-yeah.. she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
My gangstas understand me

Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on
It's gettin sweeter than a sugar cane
Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy


"It's like candy, candy!"
Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit

Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!

Hey, nigga, I put five dollars on the weed

It's time to get busy in this motherfucker
Like we always do about this time



Every dog has it's day

Another dirty 9 inch dick classic, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
Girrrrl... As I sit here sit here thinkin' to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I've think about all the things we been through
Like all gettin' fightin' for example
You know the love we have for each other
It tends to out weight what we would do to one another
You know my grand daddy used to always say
You know he used to say it like this..

There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me fairy tales or make-believe

What up motherfuckers, this is Snoop Dogg
I'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'mma do y'all
Hangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball
Givin' me the words on the street heres to scoop y'all
Nah cuz, don't believe that - that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I mean with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game for the pulpit
And that's the bidness and God is my witness
LBC, 213, hell yeah we in this - It's so relentless
And all my dogs up against the life sentence
I love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit
On some Crip shit - homie dig this


I used to have a lot broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
To see if our lives was straight
To see the man upstairs on some real talk homie
I'm tired of bein' stuck here
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms
I know


Now, as I think back to the words my grand daddy used to say
I've never seen him in church, but he always had the word
He always would tell me; "sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad"
"You gotta to do bad in other to do good"



Smoking smoking weed
I'm going to invite her
I'm getting higher
Smoking smoking weed

Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs
Wiped the boogers out my eyes. put some braids in my hair
Grabbed my favorite toothbrush and then some crest
Rinse my mouth out, now I'm ready for the rest
Break it down, roll it up, pass if you've had enough
You're with the big boss Dogg so go and puff puff
Real talk, can you still walk?
Have a seat, have a drink, now rest your feet
See that's the problem, you think that you can go with me?
Smoking cest your whole life, now you wanna blow with me
Go to the store with me and get some swishy sweet
And grab a bite to eat before you fall out
I'm a ball out and everyday, we're going to smoke until we all out
And that's a promise cuh, we got the bombest bud
And you can ask Ray J, he knows what time it was

In the Cadillac, with my head back
Feeling real good cause it's like that
Another 20' sack we've got plenty' that
We keep doing that

Smoking smoking weed
Smokin on these trees, keeps me at ease With these
Crazy things I see
Smokin on these trees, keeps me it seems
And I don't just where I'd be - smoking smoking weed

I'm going to invite her
I'm getting higher
I'm right beside her
Where did my pipe go?

I got the cush and the yerp
Packaged in P's to keep the feds of my chirp
Uhh cause my nerves' on alert
Paranoid like your boy cookin up the work
Look pimpin I ain't touching that dirt
I ain't smokin that shit
It'll make your whole head hurt
I got the card for the cataract
Doctor say it's legal
To twist up green
Knockout pays me my check
Silver haze blowin out the Lamborghini air vents
I got the blunts and a pound of leaves
I been the purp man plus I got that OG


I'm going to invite her
I'm getting higher
I'm right beside her
Where did my pipe go?

Blaze in the bush of that cush
You gotta pull hard then push
I blow dro but to each his own
And I keep shit fit like Cheech and Chong
We can be outta town
We can be at home
I keep a good connect for that Cali grown
Weed so strong you can smell it through the sac
It's in the backpack in the trunk of the 'lac
It's a buck that's a fact
Won't accept nothin less
So you can smoke alone
Pass the cush, let me hit that next
Slim thugga muh fugga

I'm going to invite her
I'm getting higher
I'm right beside her
Where did my pipe go?

See Stacey Adams, 501's
That shit was fascinating

Drinkin', sell a lil' cocaine
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it
Now everybody know me
They watchin' the makings of a real OG

Good evening ladies and gentlemen

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy

It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to "One Love"
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went "Ahhh"
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on somethin fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that ho and y'all got fo' kids

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy

Was born to be a motherfucking legend
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame

Wrist watches that don’t tick
Courtside seats, arena suites
Shining, got diamonds, 10 thousand dollars in my teeth
Cool with the hustlers and athletes

Cute little mama, but they stacked with backs
I’m smoking grape, purple urple
You in doggie world, come and join my circle
I break down herbal 'til I move like a turtle
My money is green, and my Porsche is turbo
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
I’m in the game for real, it pays to chill
I walk in the club, and they front the bill
I’m the big dog, best beware
You coming with me, if you stop and stare
She'll be on my team, in my car
On the way to the spot, yes you are
Toasting up, hosting us
And when we done, we west coasting love
For shendo, blowing endo
How much for the dog in the window

Wh-what, wh-what?
Boom!
Boom!
Say what? Say what?
Boom!
Talk to 'em T-pain

La, la la la
Boom shakalaka when it drop, oh I'mma have her saying
La, la la la
One hitter quitter, shawty know the damn thing
Boom!

I'm all about the money, the money I got
On the V.I.P. tip, Maserati's in the lot
Chilling with the stars, where the bottles never stop
Got a model on my lap, baby show me what you got
With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls, wanna do it to daddy
Real talk, tha suites is next
One more drink gonna lead to sex
These girls is bad, the floor is packed
They shut the door down when it reach the max
Whatchu tryna drink? Clear or yak?
She got a apple-bottom homie, all I do is mack
I does it well, your game is wack
I gets to the business, no chit-chat
Now where do we go? I beast the gush
She in love with the gangster, that's whassup

That's whassup!
Boom!

Boom!
That's whassup!
Boom

La, la la la

One hitter quitter, shawty know the damn thing
Boom!

Boom shakalaka, here comes the chief rocka
Smoke good with T-Pain, and Snoop the weed doctor
Big 808, now feel the base in your chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta'
Coke bottle shape, light green eyes
Drunk off of love like a Colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs, I'mma smoke 'til I die
Just bust a bad one, for my homie D. Dimes
They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains, you ever taste Purple Rain?
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, still a G-thang
Lil' mama whip your hair, exhale the chronic
As the smoke disappears, I'm ready to ball
Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg

Boom!
Say what? Say what?
Boom!
I don't think they heard you
Boom
Talk to 'em T-Pain

La, la la la
Boom shakalaka when it drop, oh I'mma have her saying
La, la la la
One hitter quitter, shawty know the damn thing
Boom!

Hold up, I wanna rock right now
My name is Hov and I came to shake the town
Yeah, your boy's internationally known
But I'm from the hood, got a pocket full of stones
I used to cop "Rob Base", turn it into "EZ Rock"
Just to stay "Doug E. Fresh", all that shit to easy rock
Used to "Chef" Raekwon, give fiends a "Ghostface"
Y'all know my "Forte", I just might catch a dope case
I "Mastered" the "P"
With connects in the Midwest, so I'm "Heavy" in the "D"
Your boy still "Snoop" around
Since a pup, I been "Kurupt" and I fuck with Tha Dogg Pound
Ugh! Roc Nation is the gang now
Some dope lyrics is the only thing I slang now
I "Get the Job Done", I put the "Kane" down
It's no "Biggie" - heh, I'm just a king now



G Mix!!!! I was a fiend, before I became a teen
I melted cabbage sacks instead of cones of ice cream
Crime orientated that's how the west was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzle, complicated
I dropped the sack and tried to rap hits y'all
They tried to bang on me, and say that I'm too small
Cool!!! Cause I don't get upset
I call the king of the east catch a flight then I jet
Right back to the west, where my niggas is at
Scoop the gilly put it back on the map
Like this like that while you rollin a bag
Loadin ya gat, pop pop, I'm holdin ya back
I'm like the Whopper FUCK THE BIG MAC!!!
Run up on the dog my gat go click clack
And that's fo' sho!!!
The reason why, man I don't know so let's go cuz


Boss Dogg chillin', looking like a million
Yeah, nigga got it, I'mma leave it to my children
Tonight I'm on some other shit, and baby loving it
Hella fast, grip they ass like the oven mitt
I'm gooned up, boy! Rich as fuck, boy!
Black and gold brakes, that's my truck, boy
I'm on my Eastside, shit I'm working
I got the party going, and it's jerking
My niggas all long, we rolling out deck
Hoes getting in, you better pick a bitch
Cause when I shut it down, the party's over with
She call me "Superman", I'm on my "Soulja" shit
Boss Dogg get em, I sick em and take em home
West Coast bitch, I'm on my fucking throne
I'm gigging on these hoes, do em like dominoes
And slam em on they back and tell em "vamanos"



Turn me up, turn me up
Just Blaze

What's up, what's happening?
Big Snoop in this bitch, get it crackin'
Dickies creased up and they saggin'
Gat in the right side, left side flag
Niggas running at the lip again
Got me feelin' I'ma trip again
And you thought I wasn't listenin'
Bitches talking shit, got me walkin' like a Crip again
Gotta hit you with the re-up
I'm married to the streets, fuck a prenup

Long Beach on my right side
CPT on my left side

Tiny loccs from the third and they screaming out East Side

Bitch niggas still bang on 'em

And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle
We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em
Bitch niggas  still bang on 'em
50 Cal shots, let it rain on 'em
And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle
We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em
Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em
Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em
But then again I ain't brainless

Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em
Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em
But I ain't tryna make ya famous
I'll have my tiny locos hit you with the stainless

Creepin' through the fog
And steppin' through the smog
And you know I'm high as shit

Shit you know who I be
D-O double G, super C-R-I-P
Creepin' through the fog

Super Crip, what?

Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?

Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas need that

It's enough of that to go around
Real G's make the hood go 'round
Keep the planet spinnin' on it's axis
How is he so hood? How can you ask this?
I guess you can say I put in practice
On the strip, under lights, now I'm back bitch
And even if I'm blown on my own
With the chrome to your dome
Make you stretch like elastic
I need my real G's to the left
Bitch niggas staying to the right
I need my hoes front and center
Hard on these hoes from the Summer to the winter
Spring to the Fall, hoes still on my balls
It's the number one nigga from the hood  Doggy Dogg
Still pull up on a nigga when I need to be heard
I'm a killer and a stealer, but I ain't from Pittsburgh
Real shit on the set, I get your whole clique served
You best observe, a B chalked out on the curb
With your momma and your people sayin' "Supercrip did it"
They won't testify, so he got away with it
Now I'm sttin' on my throne, on my Bat phone
I'm talkin' to Iron man, while smokin' some fire, man
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Walkin' through the clouds with a Crip stick cane

Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas wanna trip, who?
Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas need that



And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

I do it cause I feel it
Live it like I’m talkin’
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk in it
I’m so high, yeah the weed, I’m still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like parkinsons
Bread's in the bag, call it good marketing
Life’s a bitch but I don’t cartigan
Thats what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids, go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
He's checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed



Don't let this street life get ya down
Don't let this street life run you around

Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin what my life might be like
Growin up in the street life

You can't tell me shit, about these streets homie
I done lived it and done it, runnin from the police
Out for the money, homies maintain their composure
Now that we older we sellin ki's by the doja
Now I'm a soldier motherfucker for the chips wanna dip to trip
Headed straight for D.C., down for D.P
Flipped the script and came equipped with some riders who got my back
Snoop Corleone, you know I'm always down to jack
I jack for instant thought, talkin walk the walk
Niggas who oppose automatically get stomped
Terrorizing the neighborhood niggas gainin they grab me
Southside and dash, mashin for the rep
Test in peace to deceased homeboys who ain't alive
Street life took him over now he forced to die
Slippin and slidin, bouncin countin my ends
To be straight, times is ruff for these days
Niggas is crazy, but the fear is much greater
The innovater, dominator, soul creator, out for the papers!


Bustin' and bailin', thugs addicted to drug sellin ki's
Got me riskin', the street living, catching felonies
How many niggas wanna see me gone?
You playa haters is bitches who hate to see a nigga hold his own
Forever ballin', no never fallin'
Live my life as a thug nigga, now can you hear the liquor callin'
When we blaze niggas is blinded
My competition, minimal so I live so, criminal minded
Nigga can you hear me wave yo' pistols in the sky
And roll a fat-ass blunt, I buck that shit, I bet it'll get you high
They wonder why I'm hard to kill, hard to let it go
How can I have fear, on my peers, live on Death Row
Don Makaveli, 45, tucked next to my belly
Conversating with my nigga Dogg, lyrics so deadly
When ya come to get me bring an army
An Outlaw thug motherfucker, who can harm me
Bomb these bitches, see the track smokin'
Cause real Bad Boy killers be them, gat smoking
Ha ha, open ya eyes and understand this
World ain't fair these motherfuckers doin' scandalous
Niggas don't wanna see me hot with my Glock cocked
Drinkin on Henn', screamin fuck the world this is the end
In the street life!




Yeah, yeah

Hurry, hurry, write your number on the napkin right now

I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly never change
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly be the same

Every time I try to get my life together someone seems
Whatcha doing tryna ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away and always go get away
And keep some grams in my pants have a hit a day
Am I wrong am I right, do I care living life
On my own, cop a zone, what it feeling like
Transition crimination whatch you call it mack upon
Do my thang with my gang put your back up on
Recollect and reflect on how I used to be
I'm probably the same way cud' cause I'm goin' keep it G
Secretly sactredly yall wake and bake with me
Solo creepin on the dolo tippin' like a lolo
Fans come in vans with they clans expecting to get that photo
Won't need to come back stage and have a chance to hit my dodo
Cool individual, I'm never too good
See Mack is from the hood and never Hollywood

I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly never change
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly be the same

Growing up I ain't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and rolling stuff for I was old enough
Getting every dollar and fold it up
Putin' all my weed in papers instead of blunts so they could know it's us
Every party we showing up, baggy full of pre-rolls
Light it up and pass it you holding that one too long nigga matter fact you can have it
Another one in rotation my motivation is cabage my Rollie face filled with carrots
And niggas think they are but they know that they ain't comparing
And they ain't doing no harm but I don't think I'm really caring
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
From your broke ass, I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin more cash
And rolling weed you smell the chronic when I go past
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
Yeah, I'm kinda high, but you should know that

I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly never change
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly be the same



Is this thing on?

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you bitch smokin' grade A

Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, its gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, hi it's me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Can you be my doctor?

So I can lick you up
Make you give it up, give it up
Til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey
Shittin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can put me in
And never take me off
Til you can taste the win
Do it again and again
Til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad that you came

Tell me baby are you wet
I'm gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami

She's hot on a rainy day
Don't drown
Call me up
I can save you now
Lick your feet and kiss your mouth
Swisha sweet, I got you out
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me take a trip down south
I can tell she's thirsty
I'm in the hole like a birdie
What you wanna do tonight
It's still early
Wanna get spewed tonight
She's all sturdy
I'm in between your lips
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit

Like that! We gotta hit 'em hard
And we gonna hit them like this
Pure gangsta shit
Modefied, Purefied, nigga
Check it out

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard being Snoop D-O-double-G
But I - somehow, some way
Keep coming up with funky ass shit like every single day
2 in the morning and the party's still jumping
Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving til 6 in the morning
So what you wanna do? Sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckas bounce to this


Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these, at ease
As I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Beyotch I'm just


Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
But it ain't no stopping, I'm still popping
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door
And I'll be


Yo, again!
Back up in ya muthafuckas
Flipp floppin' hoes like ?Fab Jacks?
What many fuckas remain to be, clockin' them dollas
So recognize game as the D-O-double-G, dips with the Gin & Juice

Yeah, just bounce to this
Snoop ounce to this
All my homies just bounce to this
Eastside just bounce to this
Westside, bounce to this
Nothside, bounce to this

My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em
Be about your paper nigga take it
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call it what it wasn’t
Tryna kiss a nigga all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain’t no motherfuckin rookie
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
I ain’t tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on this dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
Cause bitch i’m on that

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, thats why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause it’s over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
No, I don’t wine and dine them

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, thats why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

Hell no, I don’t need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me
The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre
Cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that, bitch I’m on that

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, thats why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

You need to quit talking crazy
I don’t need no bitch
You need to quit talking crazy

With a see-through dress
Long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep
And a player know
If I take her home, with them real big hips
You so ripe, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whisped in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?"
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shhhh
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

I want a Super Nintendo ... yeah, Sega Genesis, yeah
Street Fighter 2, all these games...
That is the black Santa Claus! Mommee! Mommee! Mommee!]

I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? {Nowhere}
Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}
In this world they hopes and dreams can't afford
The young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope-fiends, huh
Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, ha ha, check it ...

Santa Claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto ...

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me

Back then, you woke up to the sound of "I Saw Mama Kissing Santa"
Made you remenisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Santa Claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto ...

Welcome to the ghetto ...)
Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle
I didn't pop, I ain't even shouted
I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy, hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house
Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? {can you dig it}

Santa Claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto ...

Christmas Eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have messed; I says best get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived
And thank the same trick for the gifts I receive
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and Mom's private secret

Santa Claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto ...
Santa Claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto ...
Santa Claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto ...

And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust

And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are "Contagious", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home


I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we ain't fuck with thousands
We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg palace

And now you niggas believe in
What I say cause what I say is so real
Homie you don't wanna see the steel!
You dont wanna catch a body, you came here to party

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The revolution will be televised
The revolution
Just Blaze
Oh-oh-oh-oh
This is serious business
Dududududu

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised

Sitting back watching, but I'm so unstable
I been an OG since I was rockin' in the cradle
Y'all don't know that my bite is so fatal
Kick a fool down like the homie with the 8-0
Ayy though, nigga don't play though
With the 'K though, like the spray though
Sculpted left hand full of clay dough
Split him in the middle cut him up like a potato
Oh, leave 'em on the sideline, bleeding cause he tried mine
We loot 'til the boot out
Me and my brother, we was caught up in a shootout
Had to handle, pigs on a nigga, four days
Eight laws of power, eighty-five ways
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised

This ain't the local pass cash with the bra fast views
This shit will be viewed on your broadcast news
Why did I do it? My momma is on the call
Shot three lil pigs and now my back against the wall
Nowhere to turn and nowhere to go
My blood is burnin' I'm about to blow
Huey, Malcolm and Martin, those are my peers
They been doin' niggas like this for over hundreds of years
Poppin' us, fear, now it's time for us to clap back
But this time we gon' bust, step the fuck back
We ain't runnin', we shootin' and lookin' forward
Anybody, somebody, everybody on the floor
They just surrounded my place
Hold the court in the streets so I can win my case
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised

The revolution-lution-lution-lution
The revolution-lution-lution-lution
Will be televised
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The revolution-lution-lution-lution
Oh, la-la-la-la-da-da-da

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
The revolution, oh, oh, na, na, na, na, na
Will be televised

Smoking a fat sack, right here on the station that plays
Only platinum hits, W Ballz
My dicks in your ear, caller you wanna say what?
Hello? Hello? Caller?
Oh the hell with it
This is something new for the underground
In the L.B... See you when I get back
Dedicated to the East Side, Two One Street
My favorite and your favorite
Snoop Froggy Dogg and somebody new Tha Dogg Pound
Check it out right here on the station that plays only platinum hits
We be taking caller number 21 for those Janet Jackson tickets
So call in, 310-D.A.P.O.U.N.D

That's Da Pound

Hear ye, hear ye, come one come all
It's the first annual G-nic and all my Doggs
Are invited, so go on and light it
Reminiscing about the Fresh Fest back in '85
When the dubs and the San Dieg's used to hoo ride
On motherfuckers like it was the thing to do
You know what the fuck I'm talking about
After party on the lake at the big homie's house
And bet nobody bring a motherfucking gun
Cause everybody in the house's from two-one...

Twenty-first street, burst street, where it all started
And you know East Side, Long Beach, the hardest
Niggas coming realer than The Real McCoy
So step with your rap and we bring the noise
It's the gang of fly bitches, homiez on the switches
Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches
No snitches allowed inside the crowd
Cause this is the G thang, East Side L.B.C. brang
Finna have some fun represent two-one
And bet nobody bring a mothafucking gun and a...

Yeah, King Park was the location
And to be a G, that was my destination


Tatatata.....

If ya bring a strap, then ya have to trip
Strolling through the Park one day
Puffing on a fat ass J, with my homie named Tray
Deee tryin' to see if we could put this LBC thing
Back together like it was supposed to see

Cause ya know I'm down with ya, to make 'em get the picture
And if I have to sit ya, down then I spit ya
Game from the heart, I came from the start
See I was regulating, when Cragars was the Daytons

Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters
While I'm rolling with the Steelers and killin' with the raiders

And when we bang with the Saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke

And just for a second we're waking 'em up
With a small dedication, to two-one street

Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh

Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated


Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying new shit for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gone need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall


Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more that you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that


Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at




'Cause I'ma keep it G real. I don't fuck with you, cuz
You disrespected me. You disrespect my hood by telling me
Take off my flag, asking how gangster I was, nigga

You don't want no snoop and you don't want it with me

Everytime I come around they like "Oh No"

Shit I been thru in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin off that thang like I'm loco


Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol
Courdoroy khakis, stacies & brimmed up
Straight razors just keep you trimmed up
1-8-7, oh yeah, now you remember
He's electrifyin & original
So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal
The one you hate to love, in the club, in the cut
Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit
You betta check dat ho, that's what wreckin G
Now step your game down, cuz ain't no checkin me
You'll be respecting me until I leave this room
Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom
Now your name is on a tomb
They pourin out liquor with no room to consume, silly bafoon
I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin em
Walkin in my big blue chucks cuz I'm killin em


What's happin nigga?

Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye... an
He who fears fate lives like coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured
Then you get to poppin you'll have change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin donors, dead niggas wit spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snicth, and the heart of dead nark
Niggas never see the light till spark
Then they bleed, it get cold , then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin
Your services are no longer needed; rock-a-bye baby


I'm bailin thru the door again
Let momo pour again
Me and my ho again
Yea she got the four up in this motherfucker
And I'mma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka ducka us
It'll crack off, now back off -real slow
An if you don't know , I never hesitate to shoot a ho
Yea that's my reputation - you test my patience &
You & your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam
Goddammit I'm at it again
They done let bitch niggas up outta the pen
And now he lookin for me - what the heck - my game is built on respect
Now I'm breathin down your motherfuckin neck
I dumps till my clip is empty
I'm headin down willshire to send the scent
And when I get there don't ask who sent me
Just take dem shots and drop it like it hot
Bitch nigga


Ha-ha-ha
Yea nigga
Just when you though I was gone
Slide back up on you like the wind nigga
Hurricane D-O-Double G
With the G,G,G,G,G,G,G-UNIT



Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat bat to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

So go ahead and blaze up
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana

I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like me & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed

So go ahead and blaze up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana

Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now
Remember smoking with my cousin
Now we all Raw cone stuffing
Enough to wake neighbors up
KK my favorite flavor
And you ain't gotta ask cause we major
I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit
Only the best what you dealing with
It's legal now, everybody's doing this

So go ahead and blaze up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up
So go ahead and put your J's up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na

Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight



"Black folks can't never have no fun!"
These streets beeeee walkin down the avenue
These streets beeeee.. crazy!
Long Beach to Comptoooon!
Always up to no good! Craaaaaaaa
Always up to no good!
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy

Have a look outside and take a stroll with me
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?
I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me
I'mma stay down, you see me on them corners G
At your local liquor store, gettin some optimos
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real no.. the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
And when you walkin on my side I think you all need to know...


On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hoppin hippin the hop
Sippin on some Henn with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooohhh-la-la
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shakin the cops
You niggas out there just be makin it hot
But don't trip if you fakin a lot
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
{*singing*} Because if you think that you gon' slip through California
Without gettin banged on.. brother you're wrong

That's why I married the broad but she




Dippin thru the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Mad with no music but happy I'm free
Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistol's closed in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity
But just livin in big city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask

We're comin with that G shit, that C shit that makin niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Last night's dice game got my win on
About a G and a half is what I came with
But twenty five G's is what I left with
*?Teatley?* was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the curb
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
Seven-four-four-tre back to back
I sent two fools back to their lizzack

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill cos my ho might call
Ain't no thang cos I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On Fifty-ninath and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin
That's where a nigga'll be slangin
I'm makin a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shops on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tec, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if only knew

G And Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go
Devoted and quotin, back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wasn't afraid to throw 'em from his shoulders
Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night
Even the smokers that be lovin to get sparked at night

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey
Cos I represent like every day
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin to Marshall
The homey use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin his jock
Damn them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people's ass
And everybody'll  blast
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz
And that's your ass
Cuz I lived to see that day
I wished I was there I would've clowned
But that's why we "x"-ed your bitch ass from the Pound
Cos he wouldn't even squab back
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap

Some of these nigga are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been told on...
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on

Now as I perceive to get G to a tee
And before I bell to school you know I blaze up a sack
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the piece, slip to your Benz
Seven, goddamn it, went again
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you
Disrespect the game and snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too

Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you
Cos when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quarta
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
My hood is gettin hot and niggas is tryin ta plot and
Come up off a young nigga, callin his shots
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though cos you don't really know
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho
Swoop G, mothafuckin fuckin L-B's-C
Swoop G, Swoop G, G



I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy envy, please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Cali palm tree
Police roll by I got nothing on me
Cause the smoke is already in the air
I'm rolled up with two braids in my hair
I'll start with the kaki sweet
I'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the east side standing on the VIP
Back when my only red was me E-Y-E
You so PYT and you're looking so fine
I'm sorry baby girl but tonight

This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

Get back to the episode, sacks of the chronic
Out of this world, could relax on a comet
This is church music, listen to the choir
To burn my kush you must use fire
D-O double G like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like THC4
West coast bud sea shore to sea shore
When is the last time you've seen a G in a G4?
Don't worry I'll wait
Time is ticking I'm tripping
I'm slipping away
Into the zone where these whores with the thong on
A dogg whistle and they download my ring zone
And she is hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine go get your own
I put this to rhymes, get piece of mind
Oz's to die for, this weed is mine


I hear niggas talking about what they rolling up
Smell what I smoke before the bag open up
Good chance if you see me that I'm smoking one
License to get it and roll this shit
Real nigga, buying weed, I dunn sold enough
If I'm in the building it's hard not to notice it
Hit em with ? I got some hoes to fuck
I'mma hit em with an ounce of the potent shit
Don't trip bitch, we gon all sip & blow the whole zip
Let you hit mine, plus you could grind your own little bit
My nigga get high and let the hoes twist!
Say you don't fuck, impressed how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like ours
I'm rolling, I'm smoking, they burning for hours
And if it's fine, I'm smoking the whole thing entire



{*scratching* "To the Batmobile - let's go!"}
"Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed"
"Roger, ready to move out"


No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime
No one, can save the day like Batman

Commissioner X here!
Batman & Robin, we have a bit of a problem
There's trouble brewing in Gotham City
You MUST act fast!

Holy mackerel Batman! I think these clowns need to back down
Let's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em and make 'em SCAT man
We can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger
Go get The Riddler, and watch me play that nigga like a fiddler
On a hot tin roof, I got them watchin who?
She who spits it like she was sippin rot-ten brew, ooh
You just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro

Surprise! The Dynamic Duo
That's nuff shot to lick, you get done up

"Batman! Batman! Batman."



Yeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and
Hit 'em with the POW! BAM! BIFF! Whoa
Pick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace
When I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face
Robin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest
They wanna go head up and collide
And like collision, hope your moms made provisions
See you ain't got no wins baby, not even a smidgen
Mad hostility dealt, now I'mma really be felt
Switch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt
I go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter
Get, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder
So the, sayin goes, if you snooze you lose
Trust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two!


Cold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin
Catnip for Catwoman so she caught the feeling
Huh, talk about flavor for a Pringle
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle
Damn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin
They hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing

Batman! War is on the brink
It seems that the Penguin is causing a stink
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue

Shit I'm there in a flash, Batmobile on 3's
Trust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze
And Clayface will catch the em-brace
Of napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb
.. and don't you forget it
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime

Dirty Dinkins Batman!
Did you see those crispy khaki creases on that rugged wretched..

Aiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin
Get Alfred and tell him to have barbecued buffalo wings
And a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill
It's about to get real in the field

Leapin Lo-lo's! Over there Batman! That's a no-no!
Let's hop out this fo'-do'!

Yea yea yea, systems engaged
Start the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches
You ready Robin? Let's dip

Let's, dip! Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin' crack in the alley
Let's, dip! I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman!
We must, we MUST Batman, listen to me
Holy Leapin Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that come with it
And potatoes on top with gravy in the middle
God damnit Batman! {*echoes*}

"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da--da-da-dah - BATMAN!!"



Watch your mouth never speak on what you not know

Didn't forget where I came from, went back to the hood
Signed niggas, gave jobs and I made bail
And kept a lot of motherfuckers from goin' back to jail
Retail, hoe sale, OG's won't tell
Oh yeah they will, oh yeah they will

Smoking on the blunt with your temporary bitch
One thing's for certain, two thangs for sho
I'm a Long Beach nigga everywhere that I go

Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like "What you mean Dogg?"
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
To a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
Vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green
I send a whole motherfuckin team to clap shit
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist
Fuck this rap shit!

Shots fired
Suspect down
Request EMT immediately



Yeah! You know how we do
A lil' something for the non-believers
For the underachievers
Ya'll know what time it is

Baby girl go on an' pull ya weave back, D-O-G, oh yeah, he back

Befo' it rip off, yeah homie, I'm the Biz-oss

And one of my hoes known to cut ya dick off
Leave ya stuck in the land of the liz-ost
I'm back at the mayn-sion, cold as the friz-ost
Sittin' on ten acres, dawg, wit a kiz-ost
A whole lot to you, but a lil' nothing to me

"Whatchu gone next, how you gone say it
When yo album come out dawg, I can't wait to play it
Tell the truth, my nigga, I love all ya work"
Well, from me to you low, welcome to the Church
Mi casa, su casa

Then I love it when them motherfuckers say to me


Yeah! Sha Money, representin' G-Unit, good lookin' my nigga
As usual, it's a DPG-Unit connection
You know how we do it
A lil' something for the non-believers
For the underachievers

I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel

From the depths of the sea
Blowing trees in the big leagues
I got a plan, I'm going ham on all you DBs
You better double me up, safety cover me up
Single coverage won't work boy, I'll burn him up
Give me the damn ball, move the chains at the same time
Dressed to impress when it's game time, flame mine
I'm wide open, hoping, scoping out the scene
Catch a quick screen, cake walk on your whole team
Will he beam, will he run,  will he walk, talk, or will he lean
I need riders and goons when I build a team
I get it cracking with the snap of the wrist
It's nothing less than a championship, now peep this

Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady

I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel

I'm in full beast mode, too cold to be cut down
Lifting weights, staying in shape, won't be shut down
Antonio Brown or Julio Jones
One on each side, now who do you zone
They on me like a bloodhound cause I won't go down
It's like a merry-go-round the way I'm bending my routes
I'm so sick with this, they can't stick me
Stick to to this
Sports Illustrated, get a flick of this
Lost him, cross him, quarterback toss
Highest point homie had the Randy Moss him
One hand as I shook him off me
Some OBJ with a dab of that DJ coffin, get off me

Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady

I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel

If you play wing back, slot end, or receiver
You got to outwork your opponent or you won't receive a
Pass from the quarterback cause he's under pressure
They get a couple 1DB's about to press up
Looking apart from the start, on the dress up
Coach on the play, I'm hoping that he don't mess up
Ayy back up off me, you playing me close
You bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast
I rock it out and find my way into the endzone
A couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone
I tell 'em "Cool," I keep my head in the game
Cause I'm ahead of the game and I'm a veteran man

Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady

I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel

You should think about it, take a second

The big sauce boss, yeah I had to do that

You take what's mine, then you're gonna have to run and hide

He light 'em up so much that everybody talks
They all wanna turn in his Hot Pockets box

Smoky tabs hittin' that three thirty-three

Herbsauce, tender meats heat up your inside

So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a lizzle

Waitin' on the brizzle, the prizzle, the gizzle g's
When the cheese hits your tongue you'll scream, "Fo shizzle"




You can put it in a zag, I'mma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back, I'mma sit in the front
No stunt, no pump

With a bad little cute little Mexican

Zig zag how I roll mine

Bitch fuck with me stumble on a gold mine

Sitting in the stands with a hundred grand in my pants

Pure OG hit it once might choke
See I'mma go kick it with a bitch I could poke
And you could ride to high school take a toke


No stems no seeds
Mac gave me all the class that a nigga need
Just taught my old bitch how to roll weed
And a nigga riding with me getting high with me

Squares are revving to my young nigga Devin
Got the hanging out with Mac now we 24/7

Deep on the Westside
Banging where its hood at
Yep you gotta love that

Niggas used to offer but I wouldn't
Now I'm all asking where the bud at
Making it happen me and Mac just got two bitches cracking and they say they trying to smoke weed all night and down for getting tatted

Spatted up and tatted up
Suit it up and boot it up

All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...
*repeat*

Instructions to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scoping out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close cos they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cos I'mma make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
I'mma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh 'till i expire from existence
With persistence, I proceed
Supplying you with what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crystal
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch

On my balcony, asking how can I?

And got my receipt in return, so I recline the leather seats
With a trunk full of beats and, chronic filled leafs to burn
Off of Jefferson, feelin awfully naked at the U-turn
Shit, left my gun, that's a no-no
Fuck Bernard Parks, I'm my own po'-po'
Nigga talkin dirty after dark, startin stuff
May have to mark up a nigga FUBU logo
Lettin off like a Ruger promo
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos
You know the rule goes, where there's a ho there's a hater
Give these bitches numbers to the pager
Invite em to the next Dre function as party favors
Who said pimpin's hard labor?

Bendin corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it

Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm
And I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed
'Cause I got it going on

No steroids can make you hit what I'm pitching
Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen
You niggas is scratching, my niggas is itchin'
Don't keep "Pacin" but these dudes blow they "Pistons"
Yes, nigga, P stands for polish
None of y'all is fucking with he, and this is obvious
I'm Ron Artest, laying down to your garbage
While my niggas in the street pushing shit like Ben Wallace
And any ya'll could get it, even fans in the stands
These guns is a sun, you'll catch a tan with ya man
I'm no cheeto, trust this is real/rio
Everything is grande nothing is poquito
Security's behind me, with the torpedo
Cause the wrist stay frigid
How you say it? Frio
Or where I'm from, in Virgina, we say ch-ill
And the Enzo's a quarter-million for each whe-el


I got haters on my jizzock, plus the freaking cizzops
All of whom want to hit me with shizzots til I drizzop
Thank God for hip hop, or I'd be in the bizzox, uh
Jail or casket, either way you rizzot
But now I'm so fresh you could smell me through a Ziploc
Mr. S Dizzot, it's not gon' stizzop
Too much pizzazz for these piss-ass niggas to get past
Too cool for cizzops to cuff his iz-ass
Snitch as they may, they can't get the boy
These niggas giving out cases like a liquor store
Runnin' to the DA tryin' to get me for
All the money it made, I'm like forget the law
I'm not 'frizzaid, it's Jizzay, homie, you got plizzayed
Wastin' ya time tryin' to sue S Dot
Tell ya lawyer "Take that civil case and drop it like it's hot"


International, nah I'm universal
'But you a gangsta, how you get to do commercials?'
With them big wigs, 'Yeah, cuh, you do it big'
I stay real, stay sharp, and tell it like it is
I never fake the funk, niggas know I ain't no punk
They want beef? 'Yeah, cuh,' pop the trunk
We go all the way, we do it life-size
Now my life right, 'cause my wife on my right side
Yeah, and she protecting my interest
Now I'm on the move, they got me hoppin' these fences
Ay little homie, your defense is defenseless
A pimp apprentice, hey, come here princess
I know ya tired of the chit-chatter
It really don't matter, it's like a seesaw platter
I check money, check niggas, check bitches




Let's forget where we are and what's goin' on
Let's forget who we are and who we know
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
Come on baby we can escape, run away with me

We're approaching the brink but who cares
The world is getting ablaze, yeah
The world is getting ablaze, yeah

Run away, run away with me
Come and play, come and play with me
Run away, yes do the day with me
Let's escape, yes do the day with me

Switch it up

Let's forget who we were and wanted to be
Let's forget who was there, trust me please
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
They won't put their guns away, run away with me

We're approaching the brink but who cares
The world is getting ablaze, yeah
The world is getting ablaze, yeah

Run away, run away with me
Come and play, come and play with me
Run away, yes do the day with me
Let's escape, yes do the day with me

I don't understand why do they live so violently
Let's get closer to the sun, where we're meant to be
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
Come on baby no time to waste, run away with me

We're approaching the brink but who cares
The world is getting ablaze, yeah
The world is getting ablaze, yeah

Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see
Or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang

Big Snoop Dogg
You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star
I push up laid back in a black car
Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that
I came up hard as hell, check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening
That's about the time I put down the rocks
And got to working in the studio around the clock
For a small profit, but a whole lot of game
Man I'm famous, now it ain't the same

It's the one and only D-O double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg bite em all, yeah I'm burning it up
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
So get real fool, fool

Local boy made good over night shit
Not only am I getting righteous but wise see
I paid the price, with consecutive platinum hits
I up my status, ain't no more Calvin Broadus
World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping
Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up


You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck Cuzz, and him too cause all y'all suckas
Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
That's why I wear my yellow C's at night nigga




Yo, this next record right here, is a dedication
This dedicated to those, who've come to an end
Quit like Gladys Knight...
You know neither one of us wants
To be the first one to say goodbye
So, hopefully this record will help you
Get to the conclusion, ya dig?

I love this girl but I don't know about her
.As a matter of fact, I could go without her
But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother
To try to make it work when she make it so harder
Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow
I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow
For you, to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo
That's what I get for fuckin' with a video model

Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

You don't love me, you just love my Doggystyle
I used to put it on yo' ass, you ain't had it in a while
Instead of crackin' smiles, you'd rather cramp a nigga style
You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle
What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk
When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks
So it's, best we go our seperate ways and stay apart
No more me and you boo, I done had a change of heart

Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
And feels like such a...

Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

Sorry it had to end this way
But uh, it is what it is
I'm alright, don't worry about me
I'm cool, ha ha, yeah
You go your way and I'll go mine
Real talk, I'm cool, I ain't even trippin'
I'mma roll out with Raphael
Yeah, fo sho, I'mma roll with him
I'm cool, you go your way, I go mine
I guess I'll see ya next lifetime
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya



See that fly skirt? That's my work
Lil' bad bitch, met her at the concert
With a crew of bitches, doin' their dance twerkin'
They bodies around, drop, make that ass work then
I moved in, like a cobra
Nigga shut it down, party over
You can ride this dick, I'm a chauffeur
I swing big bat, Sammy Sosa

Fuck what you nigga do, only take a minute to
Suck on this motherfucker like you on a interview
Swag up, fresh from the top to the tennis shoes
Yea, look at my hoes
Pork chops and a bunch of Del Tacos

Beat the brakes off a bitch, Billy Club


Pick your ass up and drop it back down
Turn around, hear me now
You pick her up, hit her off
She bring it back, to a real boss
My bitch, my ho, my bossette
Young white bitch, Farah Fawcett
Swag trippin' on her like a faucet
Just got off the pole, 'bout to give me what a boss get
Everything you give her on the flow, flow
With the same important gang, cold like the North Pole
Got a girl out of Jamaica, the paper moneymaker
Break you for everything that you got up in the bedroom
I got a bitch that you like, jeans fit right
I turnt her over night, she's an overnight dyke
She's an overnight sensation, asian persuasion
Put my dick up in her mouth, language changed into Haitian


On the real cuz flip this, trip this
Nigga try to introduce me to my bitch
On the turf, I ain't drip saw the full dirt
Casanova, LaVert, revert
Back with another hit, better get another bitch
She's so playful, that bitch ain't faithful
Cus' I can name five different times
When the bitch went for hers, so I'm gonna get mine
I got four 'lacs, 5 Chevrolets, what it do
Even got a bulletproof, I'm tied in with the upper echelon
When you with me bitch, you get what you want
And you can bring a friend too, comment allez-vous
Little French dip for a bitch like you
Sucker punch, I don't think so
Well what do you know? When I pulled up, a little yellow bitch stood up
I threw the hood up
You know why?

Oh yea she naughty naughty, she a fuck good
She wanna party party hands in the air
And yea she don't stop, that’s my work

Hold your head back, well come on and take a shot

Because you know that I know that I got work
She a bad bitch from her smirk to her skirt
In a bra T-shirt, she a born workaholic

From my iPhone to a Android
Hey yo that's my bitch
Oh yea, she employed?
She got ass, ????
Dance, dance, dance
Yeah do it, really work though
She a ho tho' really tho'
Y'all be doing like this fo show tho'




Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fitting

I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock

Standin' amazing, hit you in the brain
Get with Snoop Dogg, he can put you in the game
Put you on the stage, maybe even front page
Get a little fortune, have a little fame
Kill 'em with class, toast to the boogie while you fill up your glass
So quick, so fast
No razzmatazz, I'm just an eastside nigga
With my gangster ass, twenties
I used to pinch pennies
Only Gs, I don't fuck with no weenies
My clique is sick, it expandin'
To outlaws, riders and bandits
What you gon' do
When we coming to a hood near you?
You know

I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock

What's beef? 'Cause beef is in the kitchen
What you want dog? I'm on a million-dollar mission
How can you get it if you ain't been through shit?
I'm just a seed that was planted by Ruthless
My family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC
Crybaby, used to C-Walk at the park
Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark
Trip Locc, kin folk, and Wayniac
Peace to the deceased that passed away
What you gon' do
When we pull up in a hood near you?
You know

I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock

Yeah, certified official gangsta shit
Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga
Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls
It's either hog status or buster status
It ain't no in betweens
You can't wake up and put this on, nigga
Every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit
Clappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches
Mansion business and stackin riches
It's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow
Gs up, forever
The boss dogg an' Tha General, front line and on the east side

Chris Tucker, Larenz Tate, Dead Presidents
Dead white boys spread across the coffee table

If you ain't a big dog stay on the porch nigga
Dog house or nothing
Dog house everything nigga

I got a whole house trap house and a flat
I'm on parole bitch so I need my pistol back
These rap niggas is too soft
I built this from the ground, pound up
Until I knock your roof off
New boss Snoop off and on and
Heed him in the morning catch him while he yawning
My bitch is on the phone and my homies 'bout to zone in
Cracky smacky dippy whippy habitual potential
Strip for your credentials
Mental unessential, shit's official like a referee with a whistle
Nah my nigga shit's official, like a Jihad, Muslim with a missile
Catch me in the air we close to the nickel block
Nigga went platinum but I still serve that nickel rock
Hard times, bad times, fuck doing jail time
Cook it up rock it up bag it up and sell mine

This my mother fuckin' house
Take your mother fuckin' shoes off when you step in my house partner
Matter of fact take your hat off too
Nigga this the round table nigga
If you can't stand the heat get your punk ass up out the kitchen
I'm in the mother fucking room

This is my house in the middle of the trap
Open this door I'm sweating like I ran a fucking lap
Customers on hold stressing they keep coming back
3 6 5 2 4 7 I got Jumbo Jacks
Would you like your cheese with that
Yeah I like my cheese with that
Crack in the pot, round the clock
Open all night hitching blocks
Serving that doop stuck in my loop
Pitching that tragic all in the traffic
Me and my group, me and my cabinet
Fillin' the coop, pick it and bag it
I got the key to this spot break in, you gonna get popped
Fuck around and get molly-whopped in here
Better not attract no cops
I got another round chopped up in here
Who want what I got in stock?
Not from Atlanta but I got heart
Chickens, birdies, quails, baking soda scales
Heavy weights exhale, 5 star hotels
I'm a grinder about my grit
Trying to increase my profit quick
50 thou under the couch
This is my mother fucking house




Here we go
It’s time

If it ain’t KK what you smoking on
If it ain’t Rosé tell ‘em carry on
It ain’t ‘bout mine ‘less the money long
Oh na na na na na na

Fat sack in hand, Mac and Dev
Back in dreads, stacking bread

Word is Doggy Dogg got that 10 a key
You can believe what you wanna loc
See I’ma pee on the tree when I wanna smoke
Underground to the top shelf
And I can do it by my goddamn self
I put some fire on the tip
High when I trip, still fly on a bitch

Real shit, real niggas, real weed separated
And put the match on the tip

Now I’m getting weed on the plane
It’s such a shame, your bitch with us
Hatin’ on me ‘cause you probably can’t get rich with us
Probably run around claim you a real nigga too
But I’ma fuck her, never call like real niggas do, ooh
No pain, no gain
I be on the yacht drunk sipping champagne
Partying with Snoop Dogg, smoking propane
Screaming rest in peace June Bug with my whole gang
Uhh, niggas hate but I just laugh at that
A milly first quarter, you ain’t half of that
Talking trees, we can go pack for pack
All day, we just smoke back to back

If it ain’t KK what you smoking on
If it ain’t Rosé tell ‘em carry on
It ain’t ‘bout mine ‘less the money long
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na

A throwback Thursday
Wanna do it your way?
Burger King bitch

Until she almost bust a vessel
Doctor, doctor
I told her, come on girl let's get it in
Cmon, get in
And cut out all the bitching
Hush yo mouth
Turn it up girl, and just listen
Bang bang






1992, "Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop
"Doggystyle" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free
Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggas knew it was Eastside L.B.C
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned

I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

I'm finally out
And the critics hated on me cause I went to the South
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
"No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast
So from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
"Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash
That's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me
Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold
I'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga

I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

Bo$$ of the City, Boss of the Coast
Some other niggas tried but none of 'em come close
They stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc
The Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke
They tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth
Motherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man
Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk
To some women as hoes, like it's my fault
Damn they lost, man they just don't know
That a bitch is a bitch, and a ho is a ho
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga

I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out

Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my Glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time i love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended Glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when i drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being
Shot


Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but i spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
I told him weed charge it 2 the game
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit

Confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun shit
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick

On Got 20 dollars y'all now that shit don't last long picture this




You niggas don't hear me though
Turn it up, nigga, this shit's in stereo
I walked in with a philly ho
Let me give it to you, young locc, on the really though
Hands, the keys, the Benz, the trees
The birds, the bees, the C's, the G's
I get it like I'm 'posed to, you should be close to me
Right up under my wing
Words I sing, verbs I bring
Bread to the park, head in the dark
Ready with art, I said it with heart
Merely distorted, dearly departed
Look what you started
I'm cool as a mother and you acting retarded
Just what the motherfuckin' doctor ordered
It's the d-o-g with the p-o-p
Not one, not two, but three

I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby
Maybe even three or four
Like three, like four
Listen to me, baby
I need two or more
Yeah
Maybe even three or four
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex

Have a seat and don't say one word
Cause you will never catch Snoop Dogg with just one bird
And if I do, I'll probably kick it to the curb
And come anew
Runnin' back, I'm-a keep runnin' through
Hut one, hut two
Down set, hike two, three, four
We go overtime
I'm-a give you something that's gonna blow your mind
And take your time, relax a bit
I came here to mack a bitch
This P is so immaculate

Puttin' hair to the snare to the bass
Snap that, Snapchat, flick it up
One of me, three of ya'll, so lick it up

Original, more like a miracle
High definition visual, digital, minimal
But it can be maxed out
Track meet, more meat blow your back out
I had to pull the 'lac out
Cause there was too many of ya'll to be left out
I stepped out mackish with the whole package
Bread with the cabbage, me and a bad bitch
Or two, make it three
31 flavors, nigga
It gets no better than this
Now, who in the world can get you more wetter than this?
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again

Listen, niggas on your team that love that money over everything
Can never be loyal, now take that back to the soil
Anywhere on earth, and it’ll work
I’m just sharing my experiences on earth for what it’s worth
Maybe it’s just me tho, ‘cause I don’t trust y’all
This sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment I fear

It was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared

Ricky is tricky, the game is gettin’ slippery
This shit is a maze, cuz singing like a Tempree
I disappear for one minute ‘til they miss me
Another TV show, more dough, I’m makin’ history
Now I’m back at your service
Wish me luck dear, I’m scared and I’m nervous
You never left you brought that hood back with ya
I’m the real deal, I ain’t got bullshit with ya
Another one I wanna make, another joint I wanna make
Open the oven put some candles on my cake
Twenty-five and countin’, etch my face into Kushmore Mountain
Can’t be scared of your opponent dog-gone it if you want it, trip this
This sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment I fear

It was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I feared



Damn, I still hear my mama voice
"Snoopy get your ass up and go outside and play!"
Hah, if she only knew what I was ‘bout to get off into
Bang!

Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

Don’t stop being you, don’t stop being G
Egotistical, mystical, officially
Shuffle my feet to the beat with my heat in the stash
G in the bag with the C on the flag
We some real OGs baby
I was getting money in the 80’s daily
Niggas like me don’t never quit
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch
You got to tell ‘em what it is, don’t play with the game
I love it when you call a bitch out of her name
Don’t you dare try to save that ho
I know that you like her but you can’t wife her
I’m going on a tour ‘round the world
Probably fuck a whole bunch of girls
Probably get a whole bunch of money, sho’ can you save some for me?
Nah, but you can come and work for me

Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

Don’t stop being real, don’t stop that rap
Don’t stop showing homies how to shake that trap
I mean I seen so much but I'm still in touch with it
I don’t stop ‘cause I know y’all gon’ fuck with it
We keep going full speed ahead with this
Niggas ain’t did the shit
Niggas ain’t real as this
We came through and peeled his bitch so quick
From the 80’s with a dope sack in my hand
To the 90’s with a DJ and a microphone stand
Can’t stop now, I’m in way too steep
Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep
Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs
The ones who real in the streets, the ones who locked in the halls
Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y’all
Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball

Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

Don’t stop getting lit with the shit I spit
I know you’re down with the Dogg, I know you’re fucking with this
Don’t stop, won’t stop, this is all I know
From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl
Don’t stop getting money, bring that shit back
Don’t stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked
Can’t say much now ‘cause I’m moving a crowd
I’m moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves
I made it out the motherfucking mean streets
And I still go back and touch the youth
I teach ‘em how to ball and I teach ‘em how to shoot
In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team
Teach ‘em how to rise to the top just like cream
Remain supreme by any means
Badda bang, badda bing

Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all



I'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled

I'm rolling every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

Concentrated, every day I'm faded
Tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now

Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams

Break it down, put it in the zig zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive Branch, get a whiff of this

Black car, sack a dank
High school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
And every day I'm high as a muthafucker

I'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled

I'm rolling every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs

Join roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her hair
She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big

And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubber bands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga getting bread, why knock it?

I'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled

I'm rolling every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

In high school, we do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to high school

We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
Get high to it

I'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled

I'm rolling every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that



You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, somethin' new
By Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies
From all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little mystery here tonight
This is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick
When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had a respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't do me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes that's somethin' that I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this ho
Just to lay this ho I know the pussy's mines
I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Ho you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
Guess who is back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well, once you're caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates
And my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love 'em
Whoa, hey, now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Red to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up bitch cause I'm strugglin'
So get off your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none



Here's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do
Let's smoke and ride...
Baby if you feel the same, let me know
Yes I do!
What you got to lose?

You done made it to see a whole 'nother summer and it feel good
Stop, now , top down through the neighborhood
Let the wind blow, open up the window
That girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe
We have a barbeque to do at four
Swimming pool party in the back on the low
BYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free
Little kids get down, I’ll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown
Now do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work
And do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt
Playing mama dear, calm and clear
This that time of the year
For everybody to be boisterous
Rock with Snoop Dogg and rejoice to this

Here's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do
Let's smoke and ride...
Baby if you feel the same, let me know
Yes I do!
What you got to lose?

Shined up my white walls, night falls
I'm feeling hella good
I'm doin thangs that you never would
Like surfin with the sharks, or shootin in the dark
Riding on a bike with my grandson at the park
Evolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate
Breakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter
Finna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion
I'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars
Neighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard
We go, till we can't go no more
It's me and mines, it's summertime
You go off and we go on

Here's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do
Let's smoke and ride...
Baby if you feel the same, let me know
Yes I do!
What you got to lose?

No Limit Records, here to protect and serve



Yeah man...

"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin
But when it comes down to the action part, the most folks take a little
Light vacation"

Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my
Peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like...

It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decided to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight
Niggas ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'

Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

Fuck that nigga, I'mma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, saying, "Niggas can't stand me"
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual
Tryin to change the direction of flowin
And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"

Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'mma do it
And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first
You can never beat a ho, lemme show you how to treat a ho
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad
Take my time, with my.. great mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to niggas who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adidas
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks
Givin niggas a puff, still givin it up
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggas is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt


We bust 'til we buss 'em up
Lay Low, I know they told you not to fuck with us
Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain
Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane
And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the shit that I spit cause I'm the shit
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch
I'm through with this! {*crowd cheers*}



{*Charlie Wilson croons in the background*}

Beautiful.. perfect.. flawless.. debonaire

Where'd you get that silky skin?
And the colors those eyes come in?
Does the light come from within?
God made you, did he make the friend?
Wings are under all your clothes
Worth more than your weight in gold
Where did God put down your mold
Or were you only made for show?
Girl you're perrr-feeeect - when God made you

Girl you're perrr-feeeect - when I see you

Yeah, 'Beautiful Part 2' - thought you knew



Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish ?rope? with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these


I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle


I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors


Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed





Yeah, I like to dedicate this record right here to my main man
Johnny Cash, a real American gangster
I got my nephew Whitey Ford on the guitar
Young Trev' on the drums
Grand Ole Opry, here we come, uhh

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jacked up the spoon on the candlestick
Dopestick pimpin on the one-trick pony
Yeah she kinda skinny but she gets my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah, you know I got to have that medicine
That prescription medicine baby
Y'know, purple, orange, green

Jack starts hangin 'round with some fiends
Got strung out, sold the cow for beans
Told young wifey, "I love ya honey
But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money"
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah, the mo' dedicated the mo' medicated
Can you feel me?

Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie

Haha, yeah I lie sometimes
What's the use of the truth if you can't get a lie sometimes baby?
Now dig this

Jack starts a track up and down the hill
Got to walkin thinkin ace what he told to Jill
Come rain, come shine, come snow or if it's sunny
Get the fuck out, come and get my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah
They say you can't buy me love, but you damn sure can buy me bud

Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
You can trust every word I'm gonna tell you is a lie

Eyo BattleCat, It's yo Dogg
Bigg Snoopy D.O. Double G
Eyka
I was thinking...
We need to take it back to the way it used to be
You feel me?
Yeah, c'mon, yeah drift with me, drift with me, c'mon, drift with me y'all

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

Take it back to the afros and the naturals
Cape cutter picks we slips into the back roads
I'm O.G. my nigga for real though
Straight up off that east side top of the hill yo
I'm looking at the overview
Thinking bout '86 damn I was overdue
Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood
While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood
That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy
What up, oops a daisy
Demon or a heathen, scheming while I'm dreaming
Screaming to get even, seeing is believing
And don't you forget that
Get it to you get back hit that kick back
Three flies one a way
Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say
Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quit trying to be grown
Day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills
I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight
Make it back to my ride
Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
Slid me away just to get me away
I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood
I'm banging riding but doing it good
When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred
With the dealers the killers the realest
The best from the west and the beast from the east
Yeah I'm acting a fool
I'm getting my degree from gladiator school
I chose this life cause I knows this life
Sell a little crack and my flows is tight
I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is
I can still hear my grandma's voice
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

Reflections of the way life used to be
Reminisce
It's all right

If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk
And these was the rules squeeze on these fools
I came up in a different era homie
Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it
Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like
Now who you wanna be like Snoop
That fool on the TV screen
Or the homie on the corner getting major cream
In the Cadillac beating like Battlecat
A nigga with money don't know how to act
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts
All money nonsense yeah none of that
Quarter sack run it back
Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
If a trick jump the track do you want your money back
Lil bitch was a bunny rat
Watch for the funny hat
Cause it's gonna come
And my granny said it's no fun
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right




Since Dre did shake the spea's out, man
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat


I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?

Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

One of every five black males before the year 2000
Will be detained or deceased
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, if you're scared, go to church

Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hoes
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank

Stanky bank is what I got cos I'mma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret

Niggas lookin for a reason

Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

They got me runnin from my life, I'm jumpin gates

So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes

They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jack

Sliding from the sky
Tumbling through space

Whirling round and round
Your kissing makes me dizzy yeh
And I'm ballin'
I'm ballin'

Hmm, I love this game coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are
Say it say it, coz they all deny it
Player play it, coz you can't deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thang we do so original
I got to have it, lavish
Is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have

Like a rose, flippin down the street
These streets they keep me busy yeh
Makin' bread
And I'm ballin'
Yeh ballin'
Oh here I go!
Ballin making dough
Working for myself
Coz it thrills me so
I keep women on my line
Coz they know
That I'm ballin'
Yeh ballin'
Oh here I go!
Driving down the road
I can't help myself
Ballin' Thrills me so
Yeh you blew my mind
And I know , I'm ballin'
Yeh ballin'

Do that, who that, you that one they called on
Baller' get your ball on
It's all on now fall on to a new groove
Really ain't nothing to prove
We, set the mood
Or shoot some pool
Or blaze a Cool
What? Whatup fool
Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my small kitchen ?throw?
You know I gotcha
Watch out, no need to pull your Glock out
It's a players affair, now
Look at my hair and the girls wit me
They got the same thang on
Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on
Coz my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'
Keep it ballin'

He starts to mill
Just rollin' tru his town
Becasuse he's loved
Loved in every city
Thats why he's ballin'
Yeh ballin'

There it is coz it is there
Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player
They say time brings change and change brings time
It's so genuine and so divine
It's been so long in fact its overdue
Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you
I fell for you, I'll always look over you
Theres really not much that a player would'nt do for you
So quit stallin' and fallin'
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'
Now quit stallin' and callin'
And come get yaself a bar of this ballin'

Sock it to your ass
With something from The Dramatics
And Snoop Dog
Let them spot that ok
It's another one of those world premiers
Doin' it to ya doggystyle, in ya air hole
For the 2000 plus 1, yeh

Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay

I run with convicted felons
Scream, yellin'

Stick in my chrome reciever, and I fins to get it on
Influenced by the dolja
Blastin' at the rollers
Callin' couple of soldiers
Fuckin' up with this song bitch
Your mom shoulda told ya
I ain't nothin' nice
Snoop brought the boss
I got the spark, lets go on a body high
Put it on my life, and my favorite weed pipe
Soldiers greed, with ice
Watch me budda up in the night
Carefull to forever, the one that ?? shot him
Bringin' the drama like a punk, but your fucking somebody
Whut Lodi Dodi, send a duce up in dey coupe
But after a hard eight
Snoop and his soldiers gonna make ya say

Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker

Nigga, all I really wanna do is
Get down, on the get down!

We up in this bitch now
Got the take to make the hap
We gon' make our money right
Tired of livin' the stress life
Pressure, fuck price
Yikes!
Know what I like
Keep it hype!
Betcha I right
Put pounds of ice on ya, like white on rice
Vise grips on mics
Turnin' to fights
Burnin' up the limelight
Fire!
And you ain't gotta strain your eyes to find us
Throwin' bad days behind us
Ahh damn up in the headlights
Bout to let it shine
Find your ass in there tip-toeing
Your ass is mine
We got you waitin' for us on the radio
So our albums can drop
Snoop, Fiend, me, Beats By The Pound, you know that's gon' pop
Jump in the game in the walkway
With enough money to run with
Till ya hear that last fuckin' woof
We ain't done yet

Chorus
Let me here ya say
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay

I come faster than a speedin' bullet
Or I can take my time and move it slow
Wake up outta my seat and hit this mic and blow like some indo
You can call me what you want
Just don't call me no punk
My name is Snoop D-O-double-G
And I'm the godfather of G-Funk
I'll put this shit down, like clown, Dogg Pound is my set
Nigga step outta line, I shoot them in they mothafuckin' spine
As I go down, you gon' realize that
See when you run up in my face you able to get smacked, jacked, just
Like that
I'mma fool, break the rules, damn, way too cool

Cause I'mma fuckin' fool, I can get silly
But I'd rather sit back, relax, new jacks, get smacked, cause I'm tryin'
To my nigga Mystikal, Fiend, and my big homie Master P
Cause thats just the way this shit gon' be
We gon' make y'all say Woof
Until you mothafuckers demand
That nigga named Snoop

Chorus
I can make 'em say
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
I can make 'em say
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay

Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay
Let me hear ya say
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker

And not only that
And not only that
This No Limit baby
Ya heard me?
Yeah
And not only that
Shit get crazy in this mothafcuker
Ya heard me?









A Lannister always pays his debts

The line in the roads, breakers of the chains
Sport of the lord, war of five kings
Lords of the rock sitting on the iron throne
Betrayal, revenge, murder, now his mind's gone
The trial 'bout to happen, he smile while he cracking
For real cause he ready for that action
Rich, wealthy and sinister
Welcome to the house of the Lannisters

Honour thy lord, swing my sword
Servant of war
We got the power

Kneel. Kneel before your king. KNEEL!

He won this game, king with the crown
Go against Joffrey and he'll cut your ass down
So sick but it's slay shit
Debt-payers, pay your dues or you will get dealt with
So much to see, blood in the streets
Incest laying with your blood in the sheets
Pop it, drop it like you wanna leave
Honour, not much amongst these thieves





Right, right, he a wild lil nigga. But that's where you're wrong at lil homie; big Snoop never left!

I am still here! Jah Rastafar-
Yeah, chada-di-da-da
Check it

Didn't think I would last, I'm adrift on a draft
While I'm flippin' my craft, hold a gift to the gab
Cre-i-zippin' my rag see, hop on the grass
Peep-pop on these suckers tryna avoid the clash
But if I must I must, let me raise my glass
Tryna move on off and put you on up - some fresh game
Or how to maintain, sustain and gangbang
You never change, you stay the same
It sound easy, don't it? I put a lot on it
I be Dogg on it, I really want it
Achieve at the speed that you work at
And these is the G's we the throwbacks
Battlecat on the track
There is just no way you can call that a comeback
We done that, we run that, from the top back little to the front
We only here to give you what you want
Blaze it, one!

When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you
Just turn me on, turn me out and let me play
Lada-di--di-da-da!

Horse and a carriage
Sports in a marriage, all in a day's work
Show you how these plays work
Longevity, heavenly blowing kush heavily
Rearange my melody, no more felonies
Half the reason why i'm great
Mississippi the state
And keep supplying yall with more heat for the street
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Lion, it's all the same
One thing's for sure, this shit bangin
Achieve at the speed that you work at
See these is the G's and we the throwbacks
Battlecat on the track
There is just no way you could call it a comeback
Been there done that

When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you
Just turn me on, turn me out and let me play
Lada-di-di-da-da!

Lada-di-di-da-da!
Yeahma, Snoop Lion

Big dog, baby

Bass go boom with the baritone
Clearing shit up like a claritone
I'm really home, I'm barely gone
Look at my eyes, I'm really blown
Peoples is ready for me to rap
But I just took a whole bone to the neck
No sweat on the set
Sprinter van to the jet

It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

M.L. and 21st, where niggas worse
Quick to put one in ya first
Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggas out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggas can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

This L.A. County nigga
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggas just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggas come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

On my boat...thumbin' through c-notes


Now here's a toast to the coast
Playa playa high costs
Uno, dos, I'm bout to get ghost
Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate cuz they will never be
Do you wanna have a sip with me?
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time


Nigga might cop a dime
And always come up with the proper line
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin with
Don't need no water to go with your order
And you ain't got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable, sportable, unbelievable, feasible, and reasonable
We leavin' 'em low
Cuz me and my loc, keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of Hennesey and 16 liters of coke
He done drank and she done smoked
The meters are broke, we put the V to the note
I brought the weed to smoke
And Dr. Dre, he hooked the beat up, indeed it was dope


Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate cuz they can never be
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time

Fireworks in the air, work dat, murk dat, hurt dat there

Wave both hands from side to side

What a view
Walkin' on the moon makin' prints wit' my tennis shoe
Went in any mall
Eenie meenie mini mall
Anotha twenty-fo'
That's the only way to go




In these times, of hate and pain
We need a remedy, to help us through the rain
Fuck you niggas, think you can fuck with me

Oh c'mon
Now that pimp gonna jump back
Bitch, and fuck that
Shit, I'm qualified to knock a hoe no matter where ever I go
Excuse me partner, this the pimpin' little pimpin' let you go
Break the bitch you say "I will"
Separate the bitch but you saying "I will"
Damn nigga, shit; since you put it like that
I'm about to lay some right now nigga
I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'mma stay O.G
And I added and subtracted in a multiplied way
Now switch worlds
Why did the little girl walk around with a gold fish in her pocket
So she could smell like the big girl
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money if you have to knock her motherfucking ass out

I don't care whatcha do
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time

Old "Blue Eyes," Dogg Sinatra
The Glock cocker, hoe hopper, show stopper
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth
I'll put you in a brick in a building
I stay G'd up
If you hit the main line
You gonna get stop
Paying motherfuckers off cause sucka duck
Me and my niggas go hard in the paint
Puttin paint where it ain't, makin bitch niggas faint
I'm talking big shit, holdin my dick
Banging on you cuz, nigga this crip

We about thousand niggas strong
Niggas disappear all the time

Can't tell you my feelings cause the pimpin' don't feel
Bitch, matter fact be gone
Fuck around and have your Momma saying "Baby, he wrong!"
Talking about he a real pimp
Bitch, is jumbo laced with the proper crop of jumbo shrimp
Since I'm prepare with my hoe, got it crackin with my hoe
Study mackin with my hoe, now I'm stackin with my hoe

I pop a bottle of Mo
About to model a hoe
Did the weed, man get here
Taking too long
But when he get here dogg
Niggas know how D-O-double G "does it"
Known for making that crip hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker

You think you can't be touched

Real set trippers
Clarify ride, we bonafide dippers
ESPN, you know Sportscenter
Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet
Home of the NBA championship
Purple and Gold, homie let the story be told
It’s the city where you shoot your favourite television episode
And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard
But you gotta have a Low-rider car
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin’
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon
That’s how we represent it though
Birthplace of Chevrolet ’64
Yeah I love showing it out
First things first my nig’, you better know where you at
You in…

LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don’t go ‘less you go hard
Go ‘less you go hard

Hollywood, Downtown and back
Life is always good
It’s not an act we so fresh, so hood
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would

Riding on the 405
On my way to pick up baby
85 in the winter time
Man, this place is crazy
I love it, love it, love it, love it
Southern surfer Cali

Rollin’ down Fairfax
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I’m rollin’ to Hollywood, I’m doing the house of blues
About 9 o clock stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary
Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk
But it’s all legal in LA
Everybody taking a hit from the politicians
Athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher
He say “Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya”
Yeah, I love showing you now
First things first, my nig’ you better know where you at
You in…

LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don’t go ‘less you go hard
Go ‘less you go hard

Hollywood, Downtown and back
Life is always good
It’s not an act we so fresh, so hood
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would



Midnight love
Midnight love
Midnight love
Midnight love

Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin' for you

I'm makin' things happen fast
Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along
Face lookin' stupid, broke, startin' feelin' dumb
I'm young but I'm a grown man
Takin' thangs into my own hands, I'm tryin' to own land
But life a twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this
It seems on but its off, I keep missin' this shit
I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on, but I can't let go
Smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life whats left is death
Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn, its still death after life
And if it don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin' to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G
But, these problems probably havin' niggas prayin' to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my shit tight, ya gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg, just to live on your knees
And I'm tryin' to keep my sanity, God help me please

Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin' for you

Mischievous and devious is how my life was
Puttin' the serve down for cabbage, just to keep the cluckers buzzed
Some of the money makin' muthafuckaz from the other side
Was thinkin' about a jack move, tryin' to whoo-ride
Gettin' jealous cuz my niggas got this rap game sold up
Blown up or not you can still get shot
You don't never play a muthafucka out for his knot
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
He kept, gettin' it on, to the break of dawn
Now he's known, for servin' more than an oz. so
He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin' chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin' for them niggas from the night before

Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin for you

Now its all about the dollars, Impalas that bounce
Havin' cars and bitches, havin' a proper amount
Quarter million chillin'
Robbin banks and many mo'
Some life and darkness
We all get it started, coldhearted
Get around, my life won't change for the good
It seems soon I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me?
Ayo Daz, you da soldier would you die for me?
The hood tradition's got a lot of niggas killed for dumb shit
The OG's think they run shit, the youngsters control shit
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite
Be siding with the drama when the dogg fight, street fight
And a lot a mob puttin' on mo
Problems get solved, but revolved with ammo and a fo-fo
But sure I did the record blast five times
254 sentence to jail time

Midnight love
I've been walkin' the street
Midnight love
I put my life on the line
Midnight love
Cuz I've just gotta be me
Midnight love
Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little druggie's callin' for you




A big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth, a big mouth

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not of heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Because I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass

A big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth, a big mouth

People used to say that you got a big mouth
Now I understand what they talking about
Because what we do is just between me and you
Not something that you run and tell your crew
But you had to told Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pam was overheard a-talking to her man
Pam was so rookie, what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from fruit town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now
'Cause you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
And I wouldn't a had no reason to make this call

A big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth, a big mouth

Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around

A big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth, a big mouth



Yeah, this is a story about a famous dog
Doggy Dogg that is
That smooth macadamian, a.k.a Silky Slim
Back in the motherfuckin' house for nine-trey
Why must he be like that?
Why would any other dog hit it from the back?
It's in his nature, it's Doggystyle baby

Doggystyle, it's Doggystyle

It's like tonight is the night by Betty Wright
It's my first piece of ass and it's awfully tight
But I'm still finna handle my business like a dog
Fading that pussy, yes y'all
So lay back baby girl, and take a trip with me
I got the drink on deck, so take a sip with me
Drip with me, while I swing my thang
Reminiscing 'bout the first time Doggy Dogg came

It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane

It was a hot sunny day in the month of May
I'm next door to the house with my homie J
Instead of being at school, I'd rather ditch and shit
Cause at one-forty-five I got a bitch to get with
Even though I'm young, I'm kind of real good
With working my thang to get a bitch sprung
She glimpsing in the mirror and shit
'Cause once I'm in it from the back all I'm hearing and shit is

Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
I will do things to blow your socks off
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
I will do things to blow your socks off

A little something for the bitches that's down with me
Keep it low as you creep and get around with me
Don't be afraid like Aaron Hall
You know you want to fuck your nigga Doggy Dogg
Have you ever had your pearl tongue licked and shit?
While your nigga's in the county and you eating a dick
The position I'm fishing and wishing for
Is doing it Doggystyle, bitches blow

Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh

Snoop Doggy Dogg, won't you hit it from the back?
I like it like that
Doggystyle, Doggystyle
Won't you do it
Won't you do it Doggystyle
Won't you, one-two, won't you
Give me love, that pussy get near it
Won't you hit it from the back
Snoop Doggy Dogg
I heard you do it, do it all the time
I heard you doing it, doing it Doggystyle
And with the Dogpound
Yeah
Givin' them bitches what they want
Serving them hoes, but you don't love them hoes
I'll tell them some more
That you're doing it, doing it, Doggystyle
Oh yes
Baby
Ain't no- ain't not- ain't nothin' but a G-thang
Baby
Do it Doggystyle for the nine-trey
With Dr. Dre
Yeah, doing it Doggystyle
Doing it, doing it, Doggystyle
Yeah

Live Studio Noise



This is a DJ Whoo production
In conjunction with Doggystyle Records and 213

I need a ride or die groupie that can get dirty in Gucci
On the floor or the hoopty while she loving me up
I'm usually the instigator
But ain't nothing greater
Than a X-rater with a nickname like vibrator
I need to do a remix to "Area Codes"
I..got..hoes and plenty more
The way it kicks on time is out of control
So when my nigga Snoop Dogg comes and kicks the door

When I walk up in the door
You best to know it's pimping on the whole
213 gets the crunk for sure
And they know about us everywhere we go

And where the groupies at

I was just about to call
'Till Snoop Dogg told me that he boned
'Till Warren G told me he rolled
Hoooooeeeee!!!

Nate Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Warren G in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Groupie Love

Looking for a chick
That love that West Coast gangster shit
Yeah girl if you think that you're the one
Let's go and have ourselves some fun
You ain't got a bring nothing at all
Just enjoy the adventures of the Dogg
I heard you like my smile
My rap, my pimp, my style
Well it's on you what it do
You got to let Nate hit it too
'Cus when we come to your town
Rule is pimps up, draws down

And where the groupies at


My fast scheme on them
We can tag team on them
That's what we need to do
Just me, G and you
It's cool when I'm seeing you
Get ready for a nine inch dick, me and the D in you
I know you don't want to miss this
Some classic LBC, 213 shit
We in your city get busy 'till you get dizzy
Trying to find all our fans
To load them up in our vans

We hate to end the show
But there's a lot of groupies at the door
Another everyone to take a see
All aboard and launch 213
And where the groupies at



Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Some do the things that they do 'cause they dumb
And some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's foul
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin' ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But instead, you put it in their head

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Ayo Snoop, why when niggas get into the bracket
Of makin' loot, niggas wan' trip
Spittin' like you 'spose to be from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit
Feel the fever, million dollar man like Colt Seavers
Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a check the next day, my homies say
This the way to get paid, DP's invade
Trippin' 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you shoulda rolled
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from sets be tryin' to set you up 'cause you set in your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Just what we need, bangin' on wax, another Crip
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?
You're like a actor wit another script
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
'Cause, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missin'
Listen, you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sacs they tossin'
And guess what it cost me, they crossed me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

That's why I dealt like, solo and bolo like
Kick a little ass and talk shit like I’m Dolomite
Dip in and floss like, ship it in one night
Fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life

Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em up

We live life like it's a party
Then y'all stop, we keep going
If they ain’t switch then
Something pop off
We don’t stop boy, we keep
Going, going, going

Getting high in my C-boy stance

Back at it
New day, same status
Drop classics, all 'til I fall, Hank Gathers
Weed addict, big blunts, zig-zag it
Roll it hard, ride big, Six Flag it
Automatic, Adidas sweats is sagging
My seeds been planted
All over the planet
We’re not the same, I ease off the plane
PJ’s Clear port in PJ's for days
Don’t know their names, I ain’t ask them nothing
But them hoes ain’t rolling if them hoes ain't fucking
Slick back on up
While I let these honeys just stack on up
I’m a 12-guage homie, you's a .22
But go ahead, my nigga, fly, just to what you do
I’m so in control
God blessed the child that got his own
And I got a big bone
It's Snoop Dizzle for shizzle with a brizzle when it's about to licked off


Getting high in my C-boy stance

I’m stuck in my zone
2-3-3-2, was off, now I'm on
Wave top flow, shit's clear like Patron
You real with me I'm real with you, you fake, then I'm gone
Fuck what you want, it's the modern day Al Capone
Going up for zippy of that nippy I put the hoes on
Stuck in the game it stays the same, nigga
The fame try to change like I'm one of these lame niggas
My chain to blame nigga, it do what you can’t nigga
LB, HIP hard in the paint, nigga
Homie, it don't stop, we get to slapping niggas, bopping niggas
Taking your girls nigga and putting Pac up in em
Hear my voice it's on point
High off life, the world my joint
XL smoke, inhale more
Small-time kid with them XL hoes
I’m just did what I'm supposed to do
Now run the whole scene, crowned the king
Pow, pow, take those shots
Forever on the go and I don't make no stops




Yeah! Lalala lala lala la la la la
Lalala lala lala la la la la
What up Snoop?
KRS in the building
Listen! Listen!

Too much brrr brrr brr
All you hear is brrr brrr brr in the streets
People gripping they heat just to settle they beefs
Now you getting chased by police
You running to the west, running to the east
But the problem is you under the beast
Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased
We need peace, not brrr in the streets
The brrr in Iraq lasts for weeks
Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps
Every time I spit they get weak
Knowledge reigns suprrreme
I take you back to the days when the telephone used to rrring
I'm reading the sacred script, KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it, uh!

Let us begin - what, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

By any means necessary, peeking out the window
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
Cause it's truth
What's that? You don't like that?
Well we fight back. And we'll be right back

Let us begin - what, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous



I think it's bout' time that we hit these niggas upside
Their head with some of that west coast
Gangsta' shit......... Ooh.....Wee!!!!!!!!!!

It's a whole 'nother day
I'm back up in ya'
Snoop D-O-Double G
I representa'
Been away for a while but you all know
I'm still doggystylin' on Death Row
Got shit locked down
Sewed up
So If you plan on comin' out nigga hold up
This a stick up
Dick up
They got yo' shit on the shelf, oh mine is too
And guess who they gon' pick up?
Some niggas think they know they shit
But they don't
Some M-A's escape
Some won't
Bumpin' heads with niggas
Where you from?
East Side Long Beach, nigga, 2-1
The homie just got paroled
And he got more stories than the Highway Patrol
Tellin' me about the money Suge Knight stole
But don't let that shit leak, 'cause nigga I get swole
Niggas tryin' to get in to get at me
Put me up on game, tellin' me who gon' jack me
But ever since I was a puppy 'til I was full grown
I never had no other dog pullin' on my bone

Say Snoop's upside yo' head

Niggas in the game be doin' way too much
Akin' tough with this east-west coast stuff
See Me
I'm all about my money mane
I stay fly and dry
I don't get caught up in the rain
Cuz game recognize game
No matter where you from
We all can get dumb, insane and
Turn the party out
Without a doubt
Unless
You them niggas who ain't got no clout
LBC and B what?
Uh, my crew
Cuz uh, we out there smokin' on the krazy glue
Upside yo' head like oops
Snoop's
The shit, that you hear them bumpin' in the hoops
Can't afford it
Homeboy
This is finished
I represented
From V-A to Venice
So when it's timid
And cold outside
Rely on the Doggy Dogg
To put the heat in yo' life

Chorus

It takes a whole lot
To be number one
I can't walk down the street
Without my gun
I can't trust these niggas fool
It ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court
Cuz somebody got dumped
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say
Snoop rocked the parte`
Nobody got kilt
It's what got annouced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet
Zip you up and roll
Now Doggystyle records is now official
Gettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials
Shippin' weapons overseas
I'm makin' G's
What who you make call enemies
But I
See nothing funny about
Makin' money
Cuz uh
We all know it don't grow on trees
So I
Gotta' get what I gotta' get when I can
Up early in the mo'ning wit' the Gap Band
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the
Double R





Ha, ha, ha, ha
Just then, I received a phone call, it was Morpheus
And he said i was the one, ha realizing the deal Heaven done
Turnin' to the east and all praise the sun
Now they blast me but they all miss
I do my 3D dance and remain undaunted
Then simply reverse the process
As the hot slugs hit their chest-plate, checkmate
Game over, you lose
Funky, drunken monkey technique without screws
As the sayin' goes, if ya snooze ya loose
And I won't be aimin' when the oozy ooze
Got em' runnin' for the hills
Style steady truckin' like eighteen wheels
Do got em' cluckin' like eighteen pills
The hex flies off then all the blood spills

The Legend of Jimmy Bones
Sharp as nails, tough as stones
This ain't based on no true story
This the real motherfucker

Carry vocal tones, most definitely will
Cause more horror than Amityville
Get out, this my house
Got you scared niggas don't chew like a church mouse
When I swing the excalibur like Highlander
The head flies off you see thunder and lightening
Too much, too late to recognize your blunder
Suddenly you hear there can only be one, well just X
We apply wild west tactics like turn back-to-back
Take ten paces and draw, but I'm sneaky with mine
Turn around at nine and blast you in your spine
High-ride off into the hot sunset
Like the high plains drifter
Hear me mister, no one blast with the
When it comes to shootin' gives up
X marks the spot and guaranteed to lift up

Payback is a dog and revenge is sweet
Murder is the cold that Jimmy lays on these wicked ass streets

I cut cha' head off, go ahead get cha' lead off, set it off
Motherfucker bit his leg off
I want revenge, this shit's gon' end
You thought I was gone, motherfucker I'm back home
Jimmy Bones, it's on so ain't no stoppin' this
I'll take you to the Necropolis
And place you in the front, remain calm through tis damn thang
Listen here man
Killin' after killin' dealin' after dealin'
You motherfuckers don't really know how I'm feelin'
But I can't waste time and reflect on that
I gotta get these niggas who stabbed me in my back
Jeremiah, loop a bitch and aid mack
You turn my peoples out on the crack sack
7-9, remember that, way back
But Karma came back, now you motherfuckers have to deal with that

What goes around, comes around
Do unto other, as you would want them to do unto you
It's a dog eats dog world

Nigga fuck that, my black ass back from the grave
Fucked up is how we behave
Where the fuck you think you runnin' to
Everywhere ya bitch ass turn, I'm in front of you
Motherfuckers wanna scream but they choke
Pissin' on they self when I raise at they throat
Grab yo bitch that suck dick while I smoke
Then hang yo bitch using tape and rope
Go on motherfucker take two to the head
Don't give a fuck, villain already dead, already bled
List of names
All on they ass, nigga fuck these games
Here to cause pain
Can't back a bitch, when niggas gotta beg
Not to be filled up with lead
Time for me to fuck her, there villain get the fuck out
Leave you stuck out, leave yo fuckin' eyes plugged out

Jimmy Bones, is that you? We killed you motherfucker
And buried yo' ass with nothin but yo bitch's bloody rags

It's out, out, out
Jimmy bones
It's out, out, out
Jimmy Bones
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Gov me livin' the vida loca in Acapulco
With my pictures on the wall on a poster, a roller coaster
So I try to dance my life away to get it over
I'm sippin' Jamison with famous friends until I'm sober
Don't wanna go home, I know I'm gonna get into a fight
I called my sidepiece and tell her I'mma spend the night
And if she out of town, baby we' gon' book a flight
She got it laid out with incense and candlelights
Your shit's on hit, officially lit
You're tryna get a nigga sprung, your pussy wet, you lil bit
You have no idea, what? You want me right here?
Are you sure that we can do this shit right here?
Cause if it's on like that, I'll spend the night here

Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need

Good love, good sex and good weed
Baby oil to rub down my sleeves, relax and breathe
Red wine, crackers and cheese, baby shootin' the breeze
While aiming to please
Oh please, don't stop with the antics
High heels, t-shirts, no panties
Me knockin', she's rockin' the boat
While baking me a cake with a root beer float
Then put the TV on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports
Every room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke
Got keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary
Mary, Mary, Quite Crip Contrary
Apartment contemporary
Jo Malone candles, very airy
So keep sendin' that right
The way it's lookin', I'll be spendin' the night

You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave

And I'mma spend the night
Fo' sho'

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"

West West y'all, pile it on your plate
A little somethin' somethin' from the Golden State
Nah, we ain't like Kobe and Shaq
It's Magic and Kareem nigga, Showtime is back
True legends, two steppin' on you peasants
What y'all thought, y'all gon' need bout two vests'
Cause we he plug, I plug
Mixed shot with the slug, listen here cuh
When I dig dug - play slick and get stuck
But don't play tough boy, go and get it up
Hey yo Cube, tell me this
Why half of the homies gettin' worked by a bitch?
Then they fall in love and get hurt by a bitch
Nine months later cus got mirked by a bitch
See I'm just a nigga that ya don't wanna
Reverse the game on her, put the bitch on a corner
Welcome to California

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"

I know what ya came for, I'm rollin' it up
Snoop Dogg nigga, y'all hold up
Never thought Ice Cube would show up
But I'm in the studio gettin' fucked up
With a beat from Battlecat, a nigga lucked up
I got my hustle down, look and learn
See how a hot nigga, cook and burn
A nigga earn like David Stern
Mixed with Big Worm when he off that sherm
Now - bust a u-turn, come by your hood
For motherfuckers that think I went Hollywood
Pick a Coast, it got to be the West
I live out there, from the W.S. nigga

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"

Fell asleep on the plane, and so did he
Woke up chillin' in the LBC
I grew up in the HNC
But that ain't what I turned out to be
Understand me that I'm still a G
Who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary
Now I'm rappin' with Snoop D-O double-G
And got the whole fuckin' world nigga lovin' me

Yep yep, they love him to death
Cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet
Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked
So gone and so blown, are we there yet?
You wonder why I got the S on my chest
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' vet from the Wild Wild West
I used to sing "Bennie and the Jets"
Nigga so boss now I sip Henny on my jets
From the East back to the West

"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
"Oh... Cali?"
"No doubt baby"

Pass the feel, the tank with the drank in the cup
Look baby girl, thats whats up
Slide by my side bitch house in the cut
With my 9 by side when I side in the cut

You gonna stand outside or you gonna jump inside?
She said cool can my girls come?
We gon’ drank, smoke then fuck some
It was 2, 3, 4, then 5, tall short thick and fine
And they all enjoyed the ride, Dogg could you bring us all back again

The big homey, y'know me

Well if it's on, then I guess it's bout time
Let me slide into this OG rhyme
I do mine the way I do mine
And I takes my time when I'm droppin' my lines
Tryin' to make their paper, tryin' to do they thang
But to me they all tryin' to say the same thang
How could you rap over beats that whack?
You ain't reachin' the crowd, you ain't makin your fact
You ain't droppin lines that hit the top
You can't make the party go hip-hop
And you can't do your thing without using mine
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind
But I'mma take my time to get my point across
And if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
And if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on
Then I do mines to do mines and I'mma keep on, keep on, keep on
To get'cha you in a... .smooth type of atmosphere
Sit back and pay attention yeah
You ain't never heard it like that
Uhh, is that right? That's right black
But uhh

Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on

Gamey Gamey says "Snoop Corleone
Listen to me man, stay away from them phonies
It's niggas like that that get you caught up quick
You gots ta stay focussed Dogg, keep your eye on your grip
Cos if you slip they gon' getcha and they gon' getcha fast
These niggas out for your money man, they tryin to get your cash"
I don't give a damn, you gots ta match
You can be from the East Coast and get love cos I ain't trippin on your ass
I don't smash on niggas who are smaller than me
I smash on niggas who big like the DPGC
Oohwee, I getcha crazy
You gots ta have a stomach for this shit, baby
And if ya don't you won't, you fake the funk
See Snoop is the G in the G-Funk
Now don't do nuttin that you can't get out of
Uh uh, you know I got big love for the real G's
We make mo' G's, I gots ta have it


I got the, I got the, I got the paper
I keep ya, I keep ya, I keep ya cryin
I thought ya, I thought ya knew my nigga

Uh, it don't quit
Now let me take my time and just get into the shit
I'm just driftin, so swift and smooth
How many niggas make the whole party move like I do?
I can't name nobody
So sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party
Ain't no party like a DP party
Cos everybody in the DP party's naughty
They acts a fool, old school, new school
Everything is everything, everybody playin cool
Ain't no set trippin, everybody just dippin
Bitches gettin with niggas and niggas gettin bitches
It's all superb, word to my momma
Ain't no drama, no need for that
You can put your gat back in your pocket
Unlock it cos Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it

Hook

Before I knew what to do with this thang right here

But just to let them know what time it is
And how we get down
Me, Kokane, and Battlecat
Gone let y'all know how we do this thang here
Check this out y'all

24 hours a day,7 days a week, can ya dig it?
That's real talk baby
You know what
We stay on point like Stacey Adams
That's real talk right there baby


I'm in a 3 piece suit
Looking too cute
Mashin' flashin'
Lookin' for a prostitute
Boo boo, you got that loot
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
It's all to the gravy cuz it's V.I.P
And everythang in here movin' belong to me
That component set, was given to me
By a pimp buddy of mine Disco D
He told me, Frisco E
This here gone be
The baddest pimp nigga that you ever gone see
Colder than Fillmore Slim
Tilt that brim
Snoop Dogg gone sell that trick
Keep it crackin' like pistachios
Get that money
And continue to mash these hoes
And when the Player's Ball roll around again
I'm guaranteed to win
You know why?
Cuz we


We stay on point like Stacey Adams
24 hours a day, 7 days a week
Yea, yea

You know why?

You know that's all we know how to do
Gee'd up to the feet up

Put on my black cape
And look like Blackula
Smack ya up with the shit that I drop
911, call the cops
There's a bitch, snitch
Ain't that a bitch
I can't trust nobody in this sonofabitch
I get rich on the fakers who hate
Bakin' my cake
And catch the Lakers at 8
On channel 9
Pop a bottle of wine
Then at 10 hit the club
With my nephew Dub
I'm trying to get mine early
I can't be seen with your girly
Continue to mash these hoes
I keep it crackin' like pistachios
I get the money first
With no rehearsal
Snoop D-O double G
Still controversial
Aahhh

Chorus 3x




Josey Wales was known for robbin trains and banks
Layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cos if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride


On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shootin range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral
I hearda ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map


Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excell
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stoppin young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hoes be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset


Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode thru
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Tryin ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight
At the gold rush, at the gold rush
At the, at the, at the)



Ahh-haaa
Get your motherfuckin glass, cus it's a blast from the past
You didn't think we gon touch ya two times nigga
Gin and Juice up in this bitch, yahhh
Get your ice, get your cups, Cus we about to get fucked up in here

I'm still smokin, driftin, swifter than a motherfucker
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin up the block in the dark blue tank
Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Dig in my draws for dem muthafuckin laws
Harrassin a nigga, blastin a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin nigga
I'm too fucked up off that G-I and juice
C-I get loose, nigga what chall wanna do
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin in my low-low
Convertible top spot for the Glock
I ain't fuckin with the hen dogg, so toss out the sauce hot
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies

Now trip dis, I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin with this Creole
Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here
Ain't no need for you be wastin my time
See I picked you up, now I'mma stick you up, and dick you up!
And give you what you need
And then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first
I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin that shit while I'm ridin up the highway
Doin it my way, the hella highway, the fly way
Swervin in another lane, tryin to maintain
And baby girl steady takin dick to the brain
Left no stain, cause she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff

Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies

Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up
Come on, now
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up

I popped by the ice cream shop
To cop something, pop something, ya heard me
Where's Serv-B, nigga well serve me
Since you got that big bad ass dank
Nigga you know I'm known for havin that big ass bank
Tryin to buy all your dope, cause you're a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
Cause times gettin hard on the boulevard
Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something
Nigga stop frontin, get at your boy
Or would it be a tragedy, ya feel me, the best weed nigga

Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin, trees, sittin on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin, I keep my eyes on my enemies
Biach
Trade mark



Big Mac, big sack, like this, like that
Big man on campus, I'll be right back
Like Mike, like Mac, my life, my bike
Menace, mo' bid'ness, in the beginnin a po' student
But ended up bein a chemist
24/7, Devin my nigga committed
Classmates, ended up as my road dawg
I showed him how to live, how to ball 'til we fall
Harder it is, make you much smarter dawg
Follow instructions, changed up the dialogue
Manifest no stress, life is a big test
Will you fail? Or will you pass? Smoke grass, trim trees
Tryin to find some air to breathe
Miss her, please baby baby please
Diplomas, gowns, caps and degrees
These are necessities in life you need so I'ma get it
Focus, committed
15 years later, but yeah a nigga finally did it
Uh, now who's to say in life there's ups no downs?
And when you get up, you gotta get down
Uh, and when you get up, look around
And don't frown on the ones that's down - just give 'em a hand
It's like mixin fixin up pots and pans
Listen up, I'm poppin like rockin a band
No plan, all from the heart to the hand
We gon' roll it, smoke it and do it again
I'm the apprentice, back on my pimp shit
Roll it, puff it, now give it to him
Uh, physical fitness, smokin relentless
Nouns and pronouns, they make up my sentence
High school days, uh
Blowin on the purple haze, uh
High school days, uh

And you know everywhere that we go
If it's Dev or it's Mac then we blowin by the O
Uhh, niggas know me for rollin the O-Z
Or somewhere low-key twistin a whole bush
And if I got it then you can get it, it's on us
Smoke so much pot that they'll probably give me my own kush
We blow about a zone, break it down blow it out a bone
Come to my crib I'll show you how to roll, bro
And my pocket's lookin kinda swole
Me and Mac smokin grade A, honor roll
Now all of the teachers on us
They gon' have contact cause I keep the bombest
Car automatic, don't need a key to start it
Know it's us just because of the weed aroma
Lookin for me nigga I'm in the tree department
With a doobie rolled up in the secret compartment
Tryin to finish up this speech and get my diploma
So I can get a crib where my OG can harvest and my niggas can ball
I'm talkin so much weed that the shit on the walls
If it start growin in the spring it gets picked in the fall
I'm used to goin to every class but I'm missin them all
Fuckin with Mac smokin spliffs in the halls singin this song

Niggas know me, hahaha
High school nigga
Dev and Mac, Mac and Dev
Put it in a zag
Put it in a blunt
Do what you want, uhh



"He's a sweet, soul, brother!"

{*beat from the remix of "Paid in Full" plays in the background*}
"You make me feel so goooood!"


In the world of change, here I am
Tryin to have some thangs
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper

Thinkin of a master plan
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full {*echoes*}


{*beat from the remix of "Paid in Full" plays in the background*}

W-w-w-w-w-well
W-w-w-w-w-welllll
Ohhhh baby
W-w-w-w-w-well
W-w-w-w-wellll, ohh baby
Ohhhh baby




From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, Funky, yes but of the Doc
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I served my cane
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit
So I ain't holdin nuttin back
And motherfucker I got five on the twenty sack
Cos I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
It's Dogg Pound and Snoop Dogg rockin gangsta shh...)
What's my motherfuckin name?

Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg
Snoop Dogg-y Dogg

It's the bow to the wow, creepin and crawlin
Yiggy yes y'allin, Snoop Doggy Dogg in
The motherfuckin house like everyday
Droppin shit with my nigga Mr Dr. Dre
And niggas can't FUCK with that
Shit that I drop cos ya know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a motherfuckin cop
Tic toc never the Glock just some nuts and a cock
Robbin motherfuckers then I kill dem blood clots
Then I step thru the fog and I creep thru the smog


Yeah roll up the dank, and pour the drank
My bank roll's on swoll
My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With the Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in yo bitch, is where ya might find me
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
What's my motherfuckin name?


Yeah yeah
As we reappear for a new year
Showin ya how it's done
Death Row, Dogg Pound and we doin it live
Check it out.....



Dogg back up in this motherfucker
Hoes know how to act up in this motherfucker
They I know I make it crack up in this motherfucker
All blue Chuck's and my khakis in this motherfucker
I'm lookin' for a thick one
Pecan brown, she lookin' for the slim one
Loves to go down, she say she likes the big one
I need her right now, do you know where I can get one?
To give me brain like a genius
She love my hair pressed like the cleaners
And got a friend named Trina
You see 'em from behind you'll think they Venus and Serena
Hmm, now that's my kinda bitch
Take your clothes off, damn baby kinda thick
Love Snoopy blue, yeah I'm that type of Crip
And we was about to dip 'til she hit me with this, trip

I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I'd like to
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home)

Got two friends, we can have group sex
Tall and skinny and always got blue on
Say I make cool songs
My nasty video made her do porn
And she go real far
Still can't believe that she's talkin' to a real star
Pop told me real hard
And threw that backshot on me real hard
Royal penis is clean, I'm king like the boulevard
Dogg do his thing, got her feelin' like a superstar
Wanna share her feelin's with her friends
Tell her husband that there's another man
And she say that I made her fall in love
I had to shake her fast like I wasn't when I was
A pimp from the Beach, gator shoes on my feet
Got my game from the streets, never been for a freak
Had the nerve to ask for money when I beat it up
I looked at the bitch like cut, dat-dat-dat

I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I'd like to
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home)

The homies say cuz don't do it to her
You gon' have to always do it to her
She be creepin' to your hotel, sayin' that she won't tell
Knowin' one night won't do for ya
Make you wanna tell my mama "thank ya"
Then give me all your paper, everytime I lay ya
Snoop Dogg, playa-playa
I'm always with a bad bitch
You could say I got a bad bitch habit
See a bad bitch, is like a fat blunt
I got one but you know I got to grab it
So lil' mama what's happenin'?
Let me know if you're tryin' to get it crackin'
Wanna chill, when you down for the smashin'?
Ms. American Gangsta, Mr. Blue Magic

I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I'd like to
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home)



I'm a man, I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shinin' and gettin' Grammy's
But these streets won't say goodbye


I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out the homeboy
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got locked, and we don't know
If he comin' home boy
The industry tell me, just leave it alone boy
Let them do them, take care of your own boy
But I sit back, think about, before I was grown boy
Then had dreams of bein' a doe boy
Yeah I was runnin' from the po-po, bangin' for the turf
Late night huntin', puttin' in work
Hood day comin', airbrushed shirt
Payday at the spot, got my haircut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
See I live in the 'burbs but I think 21st
I know since I've left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there if I couldn't write a verse


To the blocks that raised me
The enemies and the homies that made me
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryin' to be the old me
But if they think the old me ever left
Then they don't really know me
And gon' know we don't change, we just become O.G
You always addicted to the life, you just don't O.D
But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my mama didn't want me
Too wild to be her child, and pops not around
Now all I got now is the homies
To teach me, how to be a man and what not
How to break ounces into grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not
Shit, you think I forgot? Nah


Thank God every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit
That made me who I am, the music and the man
Told me that I can before the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man
They say leave the streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all came down, my career was to end
I'm sure my name would live, in these streets





High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Swangin' my bangin' my swangin' my Coupe
DeVille Scoop! DeVille, like that, right back
Top for the hill, wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin' under water like I'm aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand
Pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
Rocky land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug a boo
Whipped out, Cripped out, nigga, what it really do?
Time brings change, so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin' my wings
Groupie ass niggas see ya chipping the game
With nothing to gain, plop plop, pop and I bang

Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-Hop-per, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up
Aye, baby back up, aye baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

Thirty days later I'm back on the streets
Got a batch of bomb beach shit I'm trying to eat
Feet, to the pavement; money, I'm cravin' it
What about the bitches dog? Are you savin' them?
A snitch is a snitch if he solemnly speak
I don't know near nothin', I'm a product of the beach
To each, his own, hard as stone
Lotta ya'll niggas bout as hard as foam
Step back nephew, or feel the heat of the chrome
Playful as shit nigga, I never eat it alone
Heat it alone, then I put the weed in the bong
Step back at the feet of my throne mothafucka

Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-Hop-per, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up
Aye, baby back up, aye baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

Cinematic, right back at it
Talk the walk and walk bout that static
I am the extra dramatic
When he popped back, everybody scattered, didn't matter
I was there from the get go
Movin' heavy weights, Klitschko
Rookies and Cookies from 'Frisco
Put em' in a box, Nabisco
We the funk that killed Disco
Showed you how to go and get dis tho
And I'm the reason why your fuckin' with dis ho
But don't thank me, that's how the shit go
It's still banging Crip tho, from the intro
Hol' up, who is that tryin' to come through
Step back and get mic checked; 1, 2

Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-Hop-per, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up

Aye, baby back up, aye baby back up

My nigga back up, nigga back up
Aye, baby back up, aye baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up



As I take another chokin' toke of icky sticky stanky
Stuff a bowl, pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint

Whenever I'm makin a record, I'm gettin into my character
And I'm tryin to portray somethin that I'm feelin to where the whole
World can believe it
Do anybody know my name!?
{*crowd cheers*} What's my name!?
There are seven wonders in the world, you're about to witness the eighth
You don't believe me? Motherfucker say what?
Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet cuz
Lemme C-walk on these niggas

Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool
Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool
Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop
What kind of phone you on Loc? I'm on the Bluetooth
Talkin to my nephew, my nigga Boo-Hef, who?
He make pimpin on a bitch look so cool
Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first
Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga shirt
Hallmark ass nigga, better tuck yo' flag
Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ass
Fuck him, fuck her, and fuck all y'all too
I'm so hood, so true
And every time that you see me cuz, I'm oh so blue
That shit is dope right there cuz...



All money ain’t good money
But ain’t no money like the show money

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

I pull up in a Full Metal Jacket
Pop shots, Top notch with the ratchet
I leave a nigga dead on the asphalt
Slap em in the face tell em take them fuckin’ pants off
T’d Up, G’d Up when we stance off
Two to the chest make a bitch nigga dance off
Goin’ with the Wizzin, Juice with the Gizzin’
Rides til’ I’m Risen, strong with the pizzen'
You don’t know, oh, I fucked your hizzoe
Timbo, the Designer, and finer fuck what it cizzost
See everything I’m rock and wear its handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

The police, motherfuckin’ gang to me
And money, ain’t a motherfuckin’ thang to me
Let me break it down for you, keep a few shooters
And a damn good lawyer
Preparation for the worst, meditation with this verse
Education, Rebirth, cause you know if you last you first
And everybody wanna be the best, Red bottom shoes for your Louie bag on your neck
Baby remember before you had shoes
When yo’ life was filled with nothing but bad news
See everything I rock and wear is handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

New cars got that, good weed blow that
Bag bitch yessir, OG for sure that
Used to stay with my momma on the couch
Like the Jeffersons I’m moving on up and I’m out
Penthouse with the butler who waits by the door
To ensure I’m the only motherfucker on this floor
I got game, I got fame, I got cash, I got love
I got so many hoes, I’m bout to open a club
You got me, I got you,  you got one, I got two
Stop by and have a good time its popping’ at Snoops
Got a whole lot of this and I mix it with that
Me and Timberland remember we bringin’ it back

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those



{*fades in*} .. {y'all gone miss me}
Yeah y'all gone miss me
{*harmonizing*} Never miss what you had 'til it's gone
Yeah, y'all gone miss me
{y'all gone miss me} Yeah, y'all gone miss me

Hmm, who that nigga that brought you that gangsta shit
Befo' you motherfuckers was even ready for it?
Showed you how to tie a flag on your head
And represent your motherfuckin set 'til you're dead
Bust on the cops while I cuss the Feds
Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin head
Put the G in the P, flipped the G to a ki
Put the West coast back on the map bay-bee
Check my styles, check my files
I've been gangbangin since I was a juvenile
They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth
Keep it gangbang 100 proof
E'rybody say, "Ay Snoop" - did Death Row pay me?
Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy
I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast
2Pac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies

Rain-drops, falling on my head
Fuckin with them haters, messin with my bread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with them haters, sleepin in my bed

Ain't No Limit to this shit, ain't no gimmick
I'm in it knee deep and can't creep no more
I had to move down South on the low-low, fo' sho' doe
Dippin through the woods with Fiend, Magic, Pokey
Windows on tint, ridin like the President
But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood
20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good
Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?
Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you
Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it
And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin


Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on
Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home
With a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers
Bonafied killers
The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet
Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal
I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal
And buckin two shots at the devil
Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel
Turn up the treble cause I hit you with the bass
Remember my name and remember my face
Remember these words, and remember the taste
And remember, we all gotta leave this place
I'm tryin to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game
The Rap Prime Minister, "Mr. G Thang"

Rain-drops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with the wrong folks, messin with my spread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Messin with my ba-by, who's sleepin in my bed

{*harmonizing to fade with interjections of "y'all gone miss me"*}



Whassup nephew?
Sittin here choppin game with my nigga Bad Azz
Niggas get the misconception of us
Cause we so cold at what we do
But I really wanna let niggas know what's happenin though
You feel me?

To get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothin to hide
I want the world to see..
Gangsta niggas do your dance
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars
Poppin collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoein cause this bitch ain't never shit to me
And pussy stay sellin, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo
Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothin, we keep gettin more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga


I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back
Of they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool mayn
Go on and do yo' thang, gang-bang
In the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back
And had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayn
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfuckin L.B.C

I had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullsheeit


{*singing ad libs by KoKane to fade*}

Tearin' up spots And blocks in my hood ain't got no corners

Bustin' rocks and Glocks And gettin', ghost from the Police
No peace So, he gets served with no concern
To who gets burned
And one day they'll learn
Not to be fuckin' with the nigga buckin' with the trigga
Nothin' you could figga could help you escape
From this mind state

Now quick to bust your ass like the cop
Waitin', debatin' for my ass to flip flop
But I don't flop

Keep the clip close to my hip
And don't say shit

Will be comlete to the do is done to all that competes
Don't be alarmed as I swarm through

So, what's that?
A known fact
Battle that the habitat our men is deadly
You can get diluted or depends on where your head be
Strivin' for what your in for
And for your info mo' flow
Than the tightest nigga flowed in '94
So, stand and deliver
Watch nigga's shiver
Quiver in they boots
As I mob with my troops
Through the east where the phonies get deleted
Be seated, and all the G's I know stay heated

See I was born to be known as a thug and thief
So anyone with beef I gotta slug to sleep, peep
I'm not no nigga Figga' he can come up
By gettin' a job so I mob, not givin' a fuck
I'm the drama Mama warned all they kids about
I mash up strapped get my dibs n' out
Hustler musn't trustin' a gat
To keep me fat
Seekin' victims pick 'em and then I stick them in track
My heat black

Picture me practicin' perfection now hit the deck
Playa haters gettin' chin checked when I hit the set
Watch how they fall When I buck 'em all
We Outlaw, Westside Playa, touch 'em all
I buck them all then remain ballin'
Out the moon with my Glock cocked shot callin'
Brothers fall then they crawl and they beg for they life
Should of never tried to rush me, your dead here tonight
This is Thug Life
Go tell them bustas up at Bad Boy records
Fat tricks got a big mouth busta better check it
I can see it plain as day this game, I play wide open
I pull the trigga dead figga with his eyes open
His pride brokin', I tried smokin'
But, bailed out
Soon as they left me at the jail house
Mobbin' in my...

Or would you stay around, and beeee down
Oh girl!

Preach!


Ay yo, I don't know if you been told
But, you look like you should be gold
You're so precious, the way you shape up
I'm just here to help you step ya game up

Hop in front of the bullet and die for me
Cause when I fly, you be fly, you'll be fly wit me
And when I fly to other countries, you gone fly wit me
Come on


Now once the night wounds down, and the weed gets low
Players still playin', and I'm still on a float
I groove to the beat, 'til my feet get tired
I just want to be your desire
Eva Knieva, best believe-a
Your not a dime piece, your a diva
Take it from me you can be the, O-N-E
If you roll wit me

Now if looks was the case, baby girl'll be federal
I ain't telling you what I heard, mayne I'm telling you what I know
And I ain't telling where to stay, or where to go
And, if she, want me, we'll take a trip down, wit the homie
The D-O-double-G
And if I'm lonely, jump from a lil' town


Clap ya hands everybod-y
Everybod-y, clap ya hands

Ain't no secret I sleep with freaky
Premium bush when I push they push
And after we push I leave her
Cause I don't love her

Ha ha, and me neither
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
Who could it be, it's the D-O-double-G
Known for the bone and the chrome on the D's
Breeze through the summer in a Hummer with tint
Or dip in the low-low but that's just for promo
Never leave me alone, without the dough doe
I'm so so cold but y'all didn't know doe

Whatchu wanna do? Said you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do? Said you wanna get down?
Get down on it, get down on it, get down on it
We just wanna party with you
We have Snoop Dogg in the house tonight with the homeboy Ah get down, since you wanna get down

To be a high roller, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca-Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
Mad dreams, of a gangsta being like Cagney
Or Bogey but Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man I'mma general
So when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homey
And I'm the big homey Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin it, hittin it, while I'm gettin that
Bout it, bout it, and happy to shout out, mmm
I dissapear 'fore the game get crowded
Take a trip overseas to the West Indies, freeze

I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
Ain't nuttin on the low about me I floss
On the track better bring chips cause I cost
I don't sit back and watch, I go for it
Different colored drops on the car port, who's short?


Khakis on my leg, Lugz on my feet
I'm walkin up the street while boppin my feet
I'm fresh off the bus from Memphis, Tennessee
Head still spinnin from the Coke and Hennessey
Sit down on it, nah, get down on it
It really don't matter cause you want it, Dogg-gonit
Cuzz, you must was buzzed
When you was bumping your gums, who you thought I was?
But look, I ain't even tripping right now
It's like that there, bow, wow
So many styles I could flip em like a file
Pop my drop top and let the beat rock
Dip through, course you do, miss you
But back to the issue, I wish you
Stop tryin to clown the Pid-ound
Cause you don't really wanna get down


All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall, baby
All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall
You know it
When you're dancing yeah
You show it

Bank accounts, big cars
Living good like a movie star
My mama house ain’t in the hood no more
I moved her out to Saint Louis Opispo
But it's a trip tough cause I'm a 20 Crip though
I gotta lay low, my homies wanna do low
I got two strikes and I'm gonna get my third
These niggas snitching on me
They think I'm selling birds
So when I'm in the streets
I'm quick on my feet
See talk is cheap so I stay quick on my heat
You niggers bad, well Dogg is badder
"Rat-a-tat!", make you niggas scatter
I was once shot, your boy want me now
Went to the station that, nigga straight point me out
So I'mma lay away and spray away
At this time I think it's best to just stay away

They say I am a fool
I gotta couple strikes against me
I ain’t got time to hang around
In the hood like I was used to do
I gotta get my bread, keep my head
It's either go to jail or get this money instead

Separate, elevate
Concentrate, dominate, innovate
Try to be the flyest me
And every other homie tell a lie to me
I need a deal, I need some stones
I need some beats, Dogg, I need a loan
Help me out, throw me some cash
If I got it, you got it
You ain’t got to ask
But on the real - or is it lately?
A lot of homies tried to implicate me
They say I changed; is it the fame?
If I throw it to you then charge it to the game
In the hood another episode
Man I'm getting old, the game cold
I'm from the hood, but that ain’t how I roll

They say I am a fool
I gotta couple strikes against me
I ain’t got time to hang around
In the hood like I was used to do
I gotta get my bread, keep my head
It's either go to jail or get this money instead

Well I had a chance to listen to the album, it's very chill, it definitely makes you wanna smoke some weed
Yeah, and I don't even really smoke
I don't know if we're allowed to do that in here
No, Snoop can do what he wanna do
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness

And there ain't no doubt about it
Regarded as the freshest, by the way that I live
All the songs that I did, and givin' back to the kids
I mean I done been everywhere that you wanna go
And poppin' on a stick like a pogo
My logo, is similar to the bat sign
Way up in the sky, When you wanna get high
Now look up, Now look up, I shook up the game
With the versatility, verbability, toungetwistagility
Hell yeah, they love the dog
Grandmomma's worldwide wanna hug the dog

The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop

Look I'm back at it, melodramatic
A little more dope for you Snoop Dogg addicts
Addicted to the things I do, magic
Go go go but no gadget, I'm magic
If I wasn't invented
Then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it
I'm in it like I spread it, if I said it, All gas unleaded
For really though, I get that real hood love everywhere I go
From mommas, babies, grannies
You gotta love him even if you can't stand him

The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop

I love my momma
Through all the drama, yeah I love my momma

I love you momma, I love my momma -- I love you momma

You taught me how to read and write, how to fight
My do's and dont's, my wills and my won't's
I'll never forget, the things that we went through
Bangin oldies in the livin room, sippin brew
Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then
My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend
Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end
And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends
Time and time again, I'mma spit this rhyme again
She the queen in my life, and I'mma make sure she gon' shine again
She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee
She taught me everythang, except how to see a G
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me
Instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound
I made you cry, you made me smile
I just wanna say I love you for life
And that's the reason why I'm here now
Love, Snoop

I love my momma, yeah..

You taught me bout faith and hope
And never ever get hooked on dope

* song fades *








It's time to slow it down, steadily grindin
And this is, the big Doggy Dogg..

And I ain't talkin about no Air Force Ones
I just gotta know, before you let me get some

Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
I got to know, or you could show, me
Silk cotton see-through lace your sexy thong
I got to know, or you could show, me

Freak-a-leek, peak peak
Let a nigga sneak a few, peek-a-boo
Let's see what we can do
I'm bout freakin you, and sneakin you
Into a quiet place
So I can look at it face to face
Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton
I can tell, cause you like squattin
Your last dude, he was so rotten
And now your love is to be gotten
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind
But what I'm really tryin to do is ready between your pantylines
I know it seems oh so personal
But I'm just tryin to make you feel real comfortable
I know, so, what will it be?
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troublin me
Can I get a glimpse, one for the pimps?
I got one question, answer me this then


You came by the chuuch with a whole lot of body
Got invited to our annual pajama party
Workin that lace, I think it was the French cut
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt
Hidin it, should be dividin it
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it
And slide in it, real smooth like
With a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like
Zoom boom hit the poom-poom right
Just to get your groove right
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it
When you gon' let a nigga have a look at it?
Callin all cars, yeah baby girl you a star
But it's on you if you wanna go real far
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps
I, have one question, answer me this




There are times when I don't wanna speak
Grab a pen, scratch your chin, make the beat
Maybe not, smokin' pot on the beach
Paranoid with my boys, where my keys?
And my head in the clouds, is that him?
And my boys trippin' hard like nigga, chill
Someone new with the mouthful of boot
Now my boys, they come in with the deal

I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

Why you hounding me in the house of the lord?
Watch us, guilty
Ain't no move in the parking lot prophecies
That's why act an addiction, you can't find me
Oh ain't no smiles, ain't no joke
No bitches, please
Ain't no rest for my soul til' I come clean
I'll hear from the lord if I speak
So back off and let me eat, let me feast

I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

I know that I chose to backslide
But now I know the way
I was born and raised in this thing
And that's something I chose to do
Church all my life
I ain't stepped outside but now I feel the light calling me
Back to the fall




* censored before release

Heh heh

I was chillin'
21st, eastside of the Beach
This little fool ran up on me
Poppin' off with his homeys like he was a straight
Askin' where I'm from, while he runnin' the
Some things, son, they just don't change
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg with the law
I have you suckers runnin' like a marathon
Blue G's tryin' to creep, on the ease with it
Talkin' about, they gon' get my chain, and they gon' leave with it
But they don't know
Once they get close
That's tic-tac toe
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the west, they spray
I heard a ese say
He said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
They twist their fingers, said, "You know who we are"
He said
They keep talkin' and it went too far
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Run...
Duck...

Repeat Hook

Lil' Uno get it crackin', better ask somebody
Put some Gotti in my Loti like Illuminati
So special, it's Dego to the dome piece
Bald-head
Mashin' in the Hummy by my lonely
And little mamas get to jockin' when they see me walkin'
Well respected, better listen, when the streets is talkin'
I seen it all, sense a little G, in the hall
Black and brown, padded down, in a wrong call
And all you so-called weenies that been puffin'
Uno be like God's walk, snype you for the roof, and
I pull that wig back, live and die, by the code
To the homeys, on hold, tryin' to get parole
Hearts swole
We products of the ghetto
Like street soldier, trainer, take flight on sight
Gladiators
Mashin' on you haters
It's Sicko all day, uh, this is what they all say

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook Twice

I wouldn't be, the G that I am
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets
Run with the homeys with the heat
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be Beast of the East, you lil' busta
Look
I'm really tryin' to change my ways
I gotta move my team, cause my people's
They say it happens state to state
But when I mob in L.A
All I hear the eses say
They go

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook Twice

But they don't know once they get close
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...

They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
They keep buckin and it went too far
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged


I went from rags to riches
Quick to socializing with the baddest bitches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' Gloriaaaa doin' 90 cause I wanna

Mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Until I get caught another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law give a shit I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried still throwing these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout
Soon as I hit the cell I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screaming Thug Life nigga fuck y'all


Cats playin' games, so I'm goin' raw
Run up in that fuckin' building, kick down the door
Y'all don't want no fuckin' problems wit' X
Y'all don't wanna see them four-legged beasts
Wit' them collars on their necks
Wit' them niggas downstairs wit' the tech, you know the rest
Fuck it, blow it y'all niggas, bitch I take respect
Dog's shit hot, that's why y'all cowards froze me quick
I pop up, catch niggas on some cozy shit
With Chinese slippers and silk scarves on
Nigga out here tryin' to get his bark on, wonder why the dog gone
I couldn't take it, deface it, that nigga make shit
That's somethin' that'll happen, nigga wanna brace it
And for the record, what you gonna do to fill up my spot?
I ain't gon' front, that "Pon De Replay" shit, was kinda hot
Not!! How you gonna jack Will Smith for a beat?
That's like tryna jack me for the streets! It ain't happenin'!


Snoop Dogg, him bust gunshots
Skateboard P, they say him bust gunshots
DPG, them bust gunshots
Snoop Dogg, him bust gunshots
BBC, them bust gunshots




You thought it was gone, but it's on once again
Light up the chronic, while I take a couple of sips of the gin
Back on track as we roll like a 7-8 coupe
You deal, you chill on the funk 'cause
We still loccin' up
By the smooth macadamian who's awfully shiesty
Some thinking that I would switch, but I’m never to ever switch
Still clockin' the grip and I give a fuck about a bitch, baby
I gotta have it you see, and so does my diggy-dog
The motherfucking Doctor D-R-E

I'm still Slauson
Cause I'm the boss and
Say they flossin'
Cause it’s Compton
Every baddest bitch who wants to get broke off
Thats how I do it, get into it
With the fluid, and I thought you knew it
Doing it like this and doing it like that
Why try to put up a fight when I can just grab my chrome and put it to your dome?
Only make ya day, so before you start a gang
Would you ask your stank about my bang of the slang
Cause that's what your dealing with
My 9 double-m, that's what I kill 'em with
Fucking with Dre, you’ll be pushing up daisies

Now Gs, not BGs, but OGs
I ain't got time to be sucker for a ho
Even if she giving up dope
Yo ho, no
Your love is so out of reach
You must've forgot that I was born and raised in Long Beach
Where the hoes come a dime a dozen
You start fronting on the pussy then I fucked your cousin
I ain't buzzin'
I'mma get mine straight up
I'm still Doggy Dogg
Throwin' the pussy at a nigga like me
Cause I’m shakin' ‘em, bakin’ ‘em, takin’ ‘em, fakin’ ‘em
Making 'em brake they selves, G
And your pooh-butt nigga bet nine trips
So you know I got a grip on my shit
And I'll bust a cap if he approaches me
Just to let him see how a real motherfuckin' G
Can turn into murderer with just one switch
Now you're put to rest and there's no coming back
As I go about my life just to show you where it's at
So get a glimpse of a pimp who kicks back
And you say that I'm crazy
But ain't nuthin' but a 'G' thang baby

For one of forty-four ways
The motherfuckin' D-R-E is getting paid
Cause I fade, the shit's made, I lay real shit
Never let no motherfucker feel shit
That's something Dre can never deal with
I don't want no motherfuckin' bitches on my roster
Cross the road when you know we're gonna cross ya
You don't want no problems then
So what's the deal?
As I reveal
The true feeling that I know you wanna feel
Still do it like a motherfuckin' nigga for life
If you flipping with your bitch then I'll be fucking your wife
Dre G, thats why I'm always holding my gun
Gun days that went months and soul blunts
That made it back fat
On top of that, they don't know where my stash at
Yo, so business was as usual
Ain't no trippin' because I know you know what I do to you
The O-N-E, the A-N-D-R-E
You'll never make it to tomorrow
If, you come at me like I'm crazy
Take a look at how the streets straight raised me
And how your whole motherfuckin' city plays me



Once upon a time, in the L.B.C
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
"We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, "Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess"
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, "Step-dad, may I?"
My brothers were goin, they were gettin down
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
They all stood there, laughin in my face
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish"
I said, "Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, "One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
The princess was starin, while holdin a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, "Hello! Hi!"
Then gave another gesture like, "Come here, guy!"
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denyin that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next mornin, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin, "Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be"
They kept askin me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
"Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked
"The princess," this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?"
Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearin shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, "I've GOT to go!"
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry...

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love



Yeah, man
Do you ever sit and wonder sometimes
What if?
I mean, like, for real though
I mean, sometimes I just sit and think to myself, like
What if?
I mean, that's a big question, right?
If "if" was a fifth, we'd all be fucked up
What if?

We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg
We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"
We never had a real woman
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
We had to take it
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it

Social media only ask the he-say, she-say shit
Act like you knew that
I'm glad I had somebody tell me
"Don't think with your dick, boy! Don't do that!"
Come on, you know me, man
I pimp on, I entertain, man
I gotta be careful when I show you stuff
'Cause these haters don't like you if you know too much
Yo, ow give it up if you like this
And you prefer the peace
And won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with
We pull the cards around a phony
My sister told me, "Niggas act hard around they homies"
Because the West don't need no beef
And our Reres and our Monique
So stay prayed up, armor on, I got it
What if you talked to that man
And understood before you shot him?

The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side
You could do what you don't
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
A phony is a phony, a homie is a homie
And you know the big homie don't play that

Catch him, stick him
Rip it, ride it
La di da di, we shout out the party
The old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me
You better off tryna do you
Boo hoo, voodoo, taboo
DP, GC, what it really do?
I educate when I illustrate
And those the words I be teachin', preachin'
To each and everyone
Never been a scary one
Always been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga
Extra extraordinaire exceptionally
Never late, predicate, elevate, levitate
My nigga, I'm way too high to ever hate
Papa Snoop in my momma Beverly, heavenly
Thank God for ya'll havin' me, for real

The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side
You could do what you don't
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg
We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"
We never had a real woman
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
We had to take it
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it




I'm feeling the dough, and now I'm feeling the real
Stunning with the stunner, man, I'm one in a mil
Hold on to my hands while we walk up this hill
There's a mountain and a fountain but the waters are still
Walk in the light but I'm changing drill
Me and my homies gangbang on the field
Take a knee, make a G, follow protocol
Can't you see us kick, Capri?
Back with the Wonder Dog
Not the underdog, can't you understand?
Please believe me, I'm with Stevie
Mental wonderland
Or maybe Michael Jackson
Pure satisfaction
Rest in pussy, Hugh Hef
Playboy Mansion
Been a foe, mental fold
Split the difference punk bitch
You on a centerfold
One is soul, never told, forever G
C'est la vie, that's me

Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock wit ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back

They tried to run a game on a nigga
Word to P.E, shame on a nigga
I never paid attention
Did I forget to mention
I started up cooking up the cavi in the kitchen
Then I graduated, matter of fact I made it
Reinstated but still kept it gang related
I traveled the globe, private jets, and Versace robes
Penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?
Tanqueray glasses, smoke fills the air
And hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare
No bizaar, what a lovely pair
And they all came here just to fuck wit a player
Anytime I wanna jam, shit I'm runnin' through these hoes
Like a pack at the Coliseum
Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Bo Diddley
If you know like I know, you come and fuck wit me, fo' real

Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock wit ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back

And that's just how the story goes
Another Kid Capri slapper
Snoop Dogg
Worldwide
Good foot, on a good foot
Snoop, we did it again, playboy



She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie

I come through with the humps, I'll thump the shit out your block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spotted some hoes, tooted my horn at the bitch
The Riviera skated, my interior's the shit
Fifteens humpin', dropped the top some more
Countin' my doe, purchased 250 of some bomb indo
Floss through South Central, I'm on my way to the Eastside
We high, blazin' like crazy and don't know why
Feelin' good as fuck, on a hot ass day
And there's a pool jam right around the way
Niggas got hoes, but ladies in the world
They wanna play with their minds like little girls
I twirl my fingers in the air, run my fingers through my hair
Redbones to blackbones, darkbones to Redbones
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny cause I get pretty
It's all about game...
Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man
From Long Beach, California
From Tul-sa, Oklahoma
Tonight boardin' New Orleans from Mississippi
I know you hold the key to unlock the door
From low pro's she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin' fo' sho'
So tell me how much money can one playa make?
And how much ass can one nigga break?

I was off in Vallejo
Peelin' hoes like Idaho Potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
Bein' from where I be - D.P.G
It's manifico, ran into this pretty ass skirt
Mexi con Puerto Rico
Mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'mma approach her like that
And let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone, the place that I call home
Is the world from Philadelphia to Rome
Picture me ey, entrepenuer with my nigga D-A
Rockin' tours and we still young boys
We got bitches, they got some bomb ass lips
She used to put 'em on this bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick


Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score, and get laid by the D-O double-G
Hey girl, what's your name? You wanna go a couple rounds with me?
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same, but she kept screamin' out Snoopy

What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound, cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you, and take you
Give me a chance, and I'mma break you -
Down - to the very last compound
With my homies from the Dogg Pound

Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away, get away with all your cash
You gots to stay up on your toes when it come to hoes
I bust a brand new ho at every video
That's on the Pound and the Row, and like the wind blow -
I pass a ho to my kinfolk - and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin' juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
But before she do me, I blaze up a doobie
Then turn on some Snoopy and uh - heat up jacuzzi
And, later on I just might turn on a movie
So you can regroupie and re-do me, just for Snoopy





Shucks, stompin in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditchin you clutz
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumpin your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stompin grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's got wacked
Watch your head, I break wit
Wit G's, Muslims, hardheads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskatin
On them 20 inch tyres wit the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG poppin all that junk
About "I'll fuck you up", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day illustration beat conversation


I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been workin on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuff against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic


Killin up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em slidin in their eelskins, groovin in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop bein a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoo that's how they got the clue
I lay conversation on wax and CD's
BG's and o-riginals, here come the mission
Makin biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey, uhh
I represent the LBC-ment
Windows tint, nigga that's the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like it's laced but it ain't
This one puff uncut, no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce and a half


Shucks
*repeat*



You should smokes with me

The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing

They could search a nigga, but they never finding my bomb and
I got the stash, spot, my cash got
Lot of motherfuckas pulling, police shots

Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dilated
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated many times
You suprised how I made it, huh?
You hate it, huh, but you know, I ain't even trippin
I'm spliting that Swisha up, plotting on the come up
I'm living my life, and never putting my gun up
Dranking my drink, and I'mma smoke that blunt


The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch, will tell you how chronic it was

Gotcha listening to Snoop and now you feel like you crippin
It's all to the good, the dash is wood
You got some hoes in ya truck and now ya ready to fuck
But, they frontin and fakin, and time is waistin
She don't wanna give ya number now she hollin at Jason
Now don't get mad, just roll to the pad
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag
And when you get dizzone, crack the do'
And let me get a little snizzle
Cause ain't no fun, if the homies can't get none
Puff, puff, pass my nigga, one lizza


Come and keep me company
Baby come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me

It's the diabolical, chronical, mythological
Psychological, make a model ho, fuck a G
Pre-medical, steady slow those, ready can get it
Teacher taught it to those with mind apparatus
My status has been the baddest ever since I intro'd
I'm that nigga that brought y'all the info
On the Chucks, French braids, and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with the fog on the window
Spell ya name in it, put ya face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gang bang spinach
Drag it, blunt wrap it, or zig-zag it
Don't really matter even if it's in the package
Put it to the side, so when ya boy hit the Eastside

Make a good girl wanna get to the hood
So good got me speaking different languages

Visualize like as I do
All I want to do is like be inside you
Ride you, try to find you, fill you, revive you
Go on with your bad self baby baby cause I do adore
And I give you more

We got for sure pure, I'll even allure
Don't trip I ain't leaving you for
Jay got Beyonce, I got Shante

You know the thing about when I bring 'em out
Feels so good I had to sing about
Get it, get it now, we flying out of town, checking in a suite
Pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Aiyyo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down


Is it the way you look? Is it the way you walk?
Is it the way you cook? Is it the way you talk?
I think it's all of the above
No playtime in the daytime making love
Kids go to school, we can act a fool
Skinny dip in the pool, do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Aiyyo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down


Hey baby, ooooooohhhh
Got me going out of my head
Ooooooohhhh
Got me saying things I don't understand

Ladies, if your man make you say
He's here to stay, he's here to stay

Uhh, oh yes I am
This my plan, you my girl, I'm your man
Take your pain, take my hand, take my name
Make my kids, do your thing
Ain't no game, show no shame
If I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name
So I got you, got 212
Put your face on my back, brand new tattoo
20 years in the game, what love won't do
A lot of women want me but I want you
You look cute when you smile, so I renewed our vows
Nowadays I ain't moving that wow, I changed my style
It might happen to you
What gotten to me, shit I gotten to you
And start rapping 'bout things like love and being true
Now maybe we can make another baby or two


So good got me speaking different languages



*helicopter flying overhead*
This is Angela Sanders coming to you live
From the scene of yet another murder mystery
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered
We have no information at this time
*lightning cracks*
*helicopter passes by again*

As I look up, at the sky
My mind starts trippin, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shakin, and they breakin, tryin to save the Dogg
Pumpin on my chest and I'm screamin
I stop breathin, damn I see deamons
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for prayin, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin
"Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"
And how long will I live?
"Eternal life and forever"
And will I be, the G that I was?
"I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son"
My eyes are closed

Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me"

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet
And everything that nigga said, came to reality
Livin like a baller, loc
I'm havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag
And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
"Just remember who changed your mind
Cuz when you start set-trippin, that ass is mine"
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the lord, my soul to take

Murder was the case that they gave me
"Murder was the case that they gave me"

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad doggin niggas cuz I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor
Niggas gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo, he took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two
I put that on my momma, I'mma ride for you Baby Boo

Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me"

Switch!



Niggas, get ya Miller Genuine Draft, cause it's Miller Time
We 'bout to go hard on these hoes with this one right here

Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo ho?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen

You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her face
You got to control yo ho..

Can you control yo ho?

I went to your house
Your girl came in and started cussin' you out
You shoulda slapped her in her face
I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place
I kept on the low
Cause I knew that you was gonna check that ho
But you were quiet as a mouse
Made me start to think that it wasn't your house
Cause she was acting like a nut
You got the kind of bitch that will kick your butt
What kind of pimp holds back
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap
What's wrong with the pimpin'
Why you gettin' a whippin'
All I see is simpetttes

Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo ho?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen

You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her face
You got to control yo ho..

Can you control yo ho?

This is what you made me do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
A nigga had to go and put tips on you
Cause bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired

This is what you made me do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fire
I'm so sick and tired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
So a nigga had to go and put tips on you
Cause bitch you playing with fire
I'm so sick and tired

Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo ho?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen

You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her faaace
You got to control yo ho..




Radio, TV, and even the press
They want the meaning of V-A-P-O-R-S
Now the meaning of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be down when you're down and out
Now when you established and got a lot of money
Everybody wants to be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She had a big herringbone with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he sport boots that match with his suits
Push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cute
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these
She caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's calm and plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be like, "Can I burrow a dollar? You a star now."

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to Cee down back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed
You caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

But I could tell you how the streets gon' react
They gon' say




{*cameras flashing, Snoop interviewing Bill Clinton*}
Yo, hold on hold on hold on hold on
Stop the cameras, stop the press stop the press
Now Bill, this yo' nigga, Snoop Dogg
Now answer me this - did you fuck that bitch or what?

That's actually, not the first time that question's been asked; but
Since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would
Believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual
Relations I was given - ahh - I'm not going to answer it except to
Refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was
Inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with
Her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I
Did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters

What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..

Lies, lies, stories and alibis
Big Mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high

You tryin to cover up the holes in your sneakers
Don't you know you can't run from the Dizzogg
Y'all, niggas know what's happening you turn your back again
And I'm bound to get it crack-a-lin I'm back again
And everybody happy for me - ain't that the truth?
Black folks stick together til we die, hmm
That'll be the day..


Liar, liar, pants on fire
Which way is up I'm tryin to get higher
I won't stop puffin til I re-tire
My bitches, my niggas, they off the wire
They love-ly, they love me, call me Sire
Movie star bitches the ones you desire
Angela Bassett, Tyra, Mariah, the flyest, the flyer
See most bitches like fuckin with a rider
Slider, to the sider, invite her
To a gangsta, party, provider {*laughing*}
And beat the puddy-pot and got up
She licked the dick from the top to the bottom
Then she grabbed me by my nuts, and said "Hmm I got 'em!"


{*KoKane scats and ad libs to the music*}

Ah what's the use of the truth
If you can't tell a lie sometimes?



I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you

Glad that Nate Dogg found me
Girl you got a phatty
New York back to Cali
You know who got the bomb weed

D-O-double-G, will you keep it gangsta please

I gots to do it
Yes Yes loc', we keep the best smoke
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk
I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
You want a problem, then lets go
Cause if not I came to disco
And freak this ho from Acopoqo
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride
Let's go we hit the hood slow
Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast
In the summertime
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless

Watch it, watch it - Daz is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Kurupt is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Doggystyle is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
You might be shootin, inna de place
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectin, nowww..

Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact

When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere

My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown

At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
To the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon

With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's'll be G's
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
We do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew

It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out.. watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out!



*laughter*

Another blast from the Long Beach section
I thought these fools knew

Out on the scout I'm about my papers
Cause ain't nobody doin Dee no favors
I'm trying to get major with minor risk
Maximising the minimum of time is spent
On the heist, nice and easy believe me
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy
Keepin niggas in a headlock
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one
They slip and I'm booking em
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips
Chips to the neckline cos I got a Tec-9
Check mine like a pimp-main ho
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low
I go up in ya like a skeleton
So S-N-double O-Please let em know the crew I'm bailin with

East-side LBC
Is what I claim but my game is DPG
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
And in my world a girl is considered a bitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
Somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh!
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up...
Wake up, wake up wake up...
Get up, get up, get up..

I break fools off like leprosy
If they dare, you stare when they next to me
I'mma threat to whoever sweat my style
Hard gangsta aim to represent til death
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with
The bare hand man sleeper
I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the *?penta?*
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time
So try me you're liable to lose on my line
The 44'll be what cracks ya head
Cos that's exactly what I'm bout ta cap you with
I figured niggas gettin soft like jellatine
So Doggy Dogg tell em all who we're sailin wit


Uh, gonna work that motherfucker and do the percolator
Cause Snoop Dogg came back with the head raider
Al Davis's? Nah nigga Tracy Davis
The Eastside Long Beach greatest
Criminal with style and boy you love that
Sit back relax and let me drop another rap
But this one's for the sisters and not the hoes
The ones who be groovin it on the step shows
Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend
And like The Staples I make sure we do it again
But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up
And don't think a nigga sprung cos you know a nigga fuck
Love is a house and you got the key
So give it to a nigga like a D-O-double G
I'm from the

Lean on me
And all the ladies in the hallway wanna lean on me
I'm big Snoop D O double G
And now they all wanna scene on me
So I stand tall, do it all, never ever slip
On the microphone talking big shhh
I can't cuss I'm on the radio
Holla at the lady tho
With Cosmic Kev, big Snoop Dogg off the top of the head
Need fur on my eardrums
Here he come, here he - here he come
S to the N double O P to the D to the O to the double G
Smooth with the vocal tone
I'm rockin on the microphone
Yes this is freestyle, LBC style, G style
Shout out to ? and Michael Vick
I know the Eagles will be back next year
But don't even trip, cause Snoop Dogg is packin a cold grip
I like to flip and dip
And take you on the mothership
So you can ride and roll and get control
And lemme show you how I get cold
I might get, I might get lifted
I tripped it and dropped it
Never ever flopped it
And then they try to stop it
But you can't cause I'm hard in the paint
When I bust freestyles, make the suckas faint
It's all off the dome
Big Snoop Dogg and I'm halfway home
I need to use the phone
Could you give a dogg a bone?
I'm leaning and everybody lookin at me screaming
They wanna get a picture of the D O dub
All the ladies in the hall love
Even the big boss, he wanna get a picture
Cause he know it don't cost
And that's how it go
Big Snoop Dogg, I'mma start the show
Yeah, take a picture with me
Have a seat, come and kick it with me
In the middle, I'm on the side
Wiz on the left so you know how we ride
And when we came, we both got high
And they got mad and told us put it out cause "fire"
But you know we don't quit
We just kept smoking and I took another hit
Went to the kitchen and I had me some chicken wings
And baby said "Dogg can you sing?"
For Cosmic Kev, I said "cool I got a freestyle
That I just put on the top of my head
And then I came in and dropped it for him"
Pushed record and popped it for him
Baby start filming it now
She say "Snoop Dogg breaking it down!"
She got the camera, I got the rap
I got the wraps and I got the snaps
I got the sack and he's got the Lac
And he got the dippy-dippy scratch in the back
Cosmic Kev, this is how we do it
Big Snoop Dogg coming through with the do-it fluid
My music is dope, I never ever choke
And if I wasn't rapping I'd probably be broke
No I'm lying to y'all
It's only Big Snoop and I'm the Top Dogg
That means that I'm gonna get money
No matter what I'm doing it's sunny
It could be raining, I could be banging
You could be talking, I could be singing
I could be slanging, I could be bringing
You what you need, but I stop and proceed
To give you what you want, cause I know what you need
It's big Snoop D O double to the G
Ease.. and when I'm done on the microphone, smell me
I'm just like the breeze

Power power, 99
Everything is oh so fine
You thought I was gone, but I couldn't leave yet
I gotta say something cause these suckers got me so upset
I haven't won a Grammy yet
I haven't made a call to my granny yet
She say "Snoop Dogg, don't worry about it grandson!"
Cause when it comes to rap, you the only one
You don't need a Grammy, you got a Soul Train Award
And a BET, everthing is on cue, and you know how you be
And you keep smoking reefer, and these suckas is broke
But you can't touch me, cause I'm just cold
When it comes to the freestyle off the top of my brain
And I'm 40 years old, but it sounds like I'm 17
Cause when I be rocking, I'm oh so clean
And I'm on the hip-hop scene
Been doing this since I was about 17
And niggas 16, niggas 14, it don't matter
Cause my rhyme is so clean...





Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business,racketeerin
Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you short them my money, your ass is gettin filleted
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!

Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
From coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
Of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop
Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hoes
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm takin em out!


I come through blastin,me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone,Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die,till we burst and break
From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums
We ran outta dope,I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs

On the rocks, Ciroc, glass and I pour

Got a nigga all out of bounds in West L.A

Well um, you know we sorta kinda burn it out
You know I turn it out whenever I'm in the mix
I'm creepin with my secret and that's how I wanna keep it, peep this

When I get this pussy you goin tell on me
If I hit this pussy you can't tell on me
When I get this pussy you goin tell on me
If I hit this pussy you can't tell on me
When I get this pussy you goin tell on me

I met this thang named Juanika
She stayed in Ingelwood and she knew Tamika
Tamika and Juanika was tight like gloves
I seen em Tuesday night hangin at the club
I say what's up Tamika boo, what's up with you
She said Mauseburg skandelous, nigga so fuck you
G'd up, boot up, to hit it and show
Jump in the Burg, let's swirve on the low key

You've been runnin your mouth, tellin your girls how I'm fuckin you
What I got in my house, the things I don't do for you
Better be careful cause your girls wanna come too
Yay kiss and a rub back and now I'm up in you
And did you tell Tamika
I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel
Damn do it hit the spot
As pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot
But I might for the sake of my swipe
Hit it like it's supposed to be hit if the vibe is right tonight

If I hit this pussy you goin tell on me
When I get this pussy you goin tell on me
If I hit this pussy you can't tell on me
When I get this pussy you goin tell on me
If I hit this pussy you can't tell on me

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ain't no big deal until that ho squeals
Now I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that ho
Take a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself
The nigga you was with man he rich as hell
Even though this story is a fairy tail
Act like you that nigga bitch and please don't tell

I'm a read ya'll a gangsta bedtime story
Come here, sit on my lap
Check it out

Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka cuz
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this skandelous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight



Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj
Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj

It's the same story, a nigga rich

Oh I ain't got a problem, you see me gettin' stacks
You see I bought the Phantom, 24's don't come with that
I've been around the world, check grip in every state
Yo' bitch don't like me, she fake, some people might call it hate
But I don't give a damn, a bosses life is how I make that bread
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich and have yo' bitch make my bed
My pockets fat as shit, you niggas mad as shit
Pumps "Neither One of Us", I'm on some Gladys shit

My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj

Candypaint drippin', look at all them bags

Been out for ballin', shot callin' I make that change
And I don't want the Range, chop that trey on thangs
That's how them gangstas do it, we get our green in bricks
We put our green in blunts, you spend your green on chicks
I'm on some player shit, dynasty, straight Laker shit
Cook it up on some baker shit and chop it up for some paper bitch

If you ain't in the game for the money you the funny type
And I'm laughin' my ass off, Phantom with the mask off

And that's the way it goes, S-N double-One
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble ho
Now go get paper girl, yeah I meant for real
One time I told a bitch not to come back 'til she got $2,000 in $2 bills

Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin somethin on the side? It didn't make sense

I was in love at times
They say "Game Don't Wait" huh Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime
Got me losin my mind
Well if lovin you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be"
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never, thought you coulda
Up out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed


Took it for granted, shit, I'm cool now
What goes around, comes around


You know what girl I mean..
I was in love with you and you did me like that
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around

How could, how could, you do me wrong?

{*whistling*}



Yes.. greetings loved ones
You inside the Nine Inch Dick, experience
For the 2000 plus S-I-X
Oh we're still in it
Dig this


But which one of y'all was checkin out this pimped-out playa?
Girl you don't have to pretend
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, baby
I seen your homegirls jockin my riiiiide
And ooh, baby
Which one of y'all will step off insiiiiide - and run away with me

Which one of you bitches like me?
Which one of you bitches, bitches!
Which one of you bitches like me?
Which one of you bitches, bitches

Man them skinny girls was everywhere...
I had to stop, pause and fix my hair - hand me my mirror Jerome
Ho, ho, ho - it really didn't matter what she weighed...
See cause a big girl loves to play and play a playa, playa

Hey! Bitches! I need yo' attention
Who wanna ride in a pimped-out Cadillac and say hey!
Delicious, you look sweet like candy
I gotta ride shotgun with a bad bitch in the back
No matter what you see, or baby what you saw
If you stand tall, we gon' ball through it all
And if the police come, don't let me take a fall
Please stuff this work, in the crotch of your drawers
Which one of you like me?
I heard she was a major ho, so unforgettable
Next time I see her though, I'mma let her know

We been drinkin havin fun, me and you, one on one
Doin thangs, holdin hands, makin plans, help me sing

We been drinkin havin fun, me and you, one on one
Doin thangs, holdin hands, makin plans, I'm your man
