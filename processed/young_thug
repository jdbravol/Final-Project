She look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil
Let's get freaky deeky 'round here

Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh

I got the door unlocked
And I'm not right about everything, but I got a strong feeling she'll take me a charge if we run into the narcs
And I'm seeing all your emotions, came a long way from roaches
Unwrap the birds, get to rolling

All full pocket, macaroni
Rose-gold AP like a token
Bought that bitch a mink, now she cozy
Rather go to jail, I ain't told 'em

I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears
I bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here
She look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil

My side bitch in the driveway, yeah
Waiting on you to leave, bae, yeah

But I gotta go and gangbang

Out of all the bags, I put on her
And I said I don't brag, I don't boast
Said you'll pop the tags, I don't want 'em
And my niggas they been placed the vote
But you needed to get off the boat
I can't blame it on me I said "No"
Got her head so big it explode

You said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me
You said that, you said that
You said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that
You said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts
We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up
I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears
I bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here
She look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil
Let's get freaky deeky 'round here

Say now, ooh, ooh, ooh

Let's make our last toast, she gets the last gulp
I got some Actavis yeah, I want the last dose
I got a good cash flow, but I don't want the fast dough
I smoked a whole leaf, I'm drinking codeine
I want some head and knees, I don't want no teeth
I should've called off, I'm bout to OD
In her mouth like a golf ball, my two homies
Lay it up on me, I make her squirt on the couch, eww
Private party, only broads here
Every diamond on me crystal clear
Hit it from the back, loosen up her spleen
Say you mine, I'ma take it off and raw dog

You said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me
You said that, you said that
You said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that
You said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts
We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up
I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears

Anytime I get mad, I can goodbye to you

King of lions, who let these cats run out of the house?
Houston, Texas when I'm on land, I lean back like a couch
I'm not playin', I want it bad, call shots like a spouse
We roll that kushy up, we eat that pussy though
Suck it til you're throwin' up, my Phantom grey, no hound
I lost a Lear, no bucks, still waitin' on that Bentley truck
Stop playin', lil bitty boy, you a duck
He ain't YSL, nigga, he ain't in the hut
I might stop by and let that little bitch lush
I pull up and chop at your cousin, your bus
Little nigga, you know what it was
You know what it is, you know what it does
I'm makin' your old lady shake it
She suckin' too slow, I'm impatient
My diamonds so wet like they bathin'
Don't know where to go, I'm amazin'

What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? I don't know
I might accept your apology
I mean you throw L's up if you ain't followin'

And I've been drinkin', I need to bottle this

Man I'm so tired of these niggas man, I am so tired of these bitches
I'm so magnificent, studio workin', I'm wearin' a top like I'm pimpin'
Your bitch want my milk, I'm sittin' at the top lookin' down at these wimps
These hoes just roll me a blunt and you know that they stuff it, it cannot be imps
I never had cutlass and donks, I based up my bankroll then based out my trunk
I might fuck that lil bitch in the mornin', I might put her out and call Tyrone
Snoop Dogg, I might go ahead and bone
I'm big ballin', bitch put me inside the dome
Take some sand to the beach
Party with a couple foreign freaks
Kim K lookin' hoe, Yeezy

He broke, he servin' his squad with a scale
I make it rain, I hope all is well
I pull off deep like what in the hell?
Hoe give all my niggas some bails
Wait I'ma lay down 'fore I'll tell
Pull up in old school Chevelles
I don't save pictures, they might get revealed
How many times have I asked are you well?
How many times have I popped a perc pill?
How many homies at home on the bail?
How many times have I told you you shell?
How many meals have I ate until I burp?
Dropping the top on the Mulsanne ain't no hot top on merchs
Hey I worked so hard to get out that dirt
Hey I was thinking this is not that work



Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

What you gonna do when I pull up on you, nigga?
Pussy nigga know that he a cat like Tigger
Beat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

How many niggas standin' around you would die for you?
I’m not bein' funny but if I come through there sprayin'
All them niggas turn to 4 wheelers
Honestly, truth be told, YSL won't fold
Pick his ass off from the balcony
Walk into the house and change clothes
YSL, wipe a nigga nose
We don't give a damn if it's indoors or outdoors
We gotta have that, gon' grab that
Nigga go stab that, smack that shit
Every day I keep the bands on me, I'm a lick
If a nigga think I'm sweet then his tongue gettin' split
I ain't doin' any features unless you give me your bitch
I'ma fuck for the cash then she gettin' robbed by Tick

Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

Hundred bands inside of my pants
Make the mothafucka dance on the stage
Aye, bitch, it's a parade
Pourin' 4s is a sport, Leanorade
50 whole k spent on my hygiene
Drinkin' so much lean that my pee clean
808 just might be the dream team
Bitch got some good brain, call her Pinky
Bag full of weed, no lighter
In the kitchen wrappin', rappin' like a cypher
You know damn well, I like her, I'mma bite her
In a Bentley on West Lee gettin' trailed by sniper
How the fuck you feel that I don't mean nothin'?
All them years in the bando, no clean nothin'
Runnin' to the cops, tell 'em I don't serve the fiend nothin'
Pullin' off like "SIKE!"
Bitch I got the bando, fifty hundreds
Spot 'round the corner filled up with onions
Big homie got a whole truckload
Me and Scooter take a trip to New Mexico
All I ever wanted was the money
All I ever wanted was the money
Put your hands in the air if you dare
Any motherfucker to step over here
F&N put 'em in a wheel chair

Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

You can smell the money on me, it comes from off my clothes
Majority of my fits I wear? yeah, are never found in stores
You might as well gon', gon', gon' home
Money long, long, long, long
All the way up to Mercury
Any time I come out, gotta at least step out with a three piece

Take three drugs at once, lately
Got every shade of Tom Ford, I can spot fugazi
I came out the slums, I

If she ain't up to parrrr, she 'bout to get dead docked
Between my diamonds and my fame, became so anxious
I sit at the top of the throne, yeah, 'cause I'm righteous
Got a few Vice Lords for some friends, some of 'em Disciples
And can't nothin' come between niggas like us

I got at least 200 hoes
Fresh to death, and I leave my car and then I doze
Up and down you ain't receive nothin' 'bout this dough
And these hundreds ain't goin' nowhere like a moat

Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat

These niggas, they cowards, they won't even kill each other
Even though I got rhymes, I bust shit just like a bubble
Hey I ran up my racks and I’m killin em by the day

Arrogant swagger no lights camera action

My body keep saying I need it
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

I want to seal it
These bitches wanna fuck us, we the realest
Like it or not, brain shoot to the ceiling
So many clothes in the closet, she looks like dealer
Ran up my racks with Rich Homie we're like the pilgrims
I got jelly beans in my billie jeans
I got Quan back cause I know he got my scene

My body keep saying I need it
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

Dad told me never trip about no bitch
Daddy told me to stay down and they're gonna lose
Granny told me pray to God, that's what I did
Gotta make a way for my kids
Me and Thug flying higher than a blimp
Eating on shrimp, looking down at the shrimps
If you see me with a limp, don't mistake me for a pimp
The 40 get heavy when you tote it on your hip
Me and Thug ready, going in for the kill
And Imma look confused

My body keep saying I need it
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

Got racks on racks on racks
I got zippers on all of my shoes
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
Diamonds black, I'm a walking night
Play with Thugger, scary sight
No shoestrings in these shoes, so I ain't tripping
I ain't worried bout shit, cause I got zippers on all of my shoes

My body keep saying I need it
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AB bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
I come through there fresh like John Lennon
My wrist a Hellcat, I’m not kidding
They dig all the shit that I’m kicking
I just bought my bitch some new titties
You take out these pictures, you bogus
Wasn't gon’ turn your ass until you told it'
Wasn't gon’ ice your ass down ‘til you folded
Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
Make some bad bitches fuck my brody
I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle
They got lots of bread, I’ma call Butta

Three chopsticks, I paid a stack for it
They run me through, I probably got warrants
In the back of the 'Bach, ugh
Burning OG out of Backwoods
Not just dancing, diamonds racing Balmain
Lots of fakes allergic to seafood and serve for decoration
Lobster never tasted
Missed Thanksgiving, I was in Miami
I was on ocean, I was on vacation
In the Benz speed, 120 racing
AB in a Rari, shit was like the Matrix
In and out of lanes, weaving in the spaceship
I’m flexing, got muscle like Popeye
But fight over a bitch, no that is not I
I’m him, I'm gon' tell the roof bye bye
Then remove the lid at the stoplight
With my side bitches at Benihana’s
Brung her sister, her bestie, her mama
Told ‘em tab is on me, yeah I got ‘em
And I pay the bill all in new hundreds
Now that is real colorful money
Spikes on me, they drip at the bottom
She want Thug, and her friend is a toss up

I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AP bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
I come through there fresh like John Lennon
My wrist a haircut, I’m not kidding
They dig all the shit that I’m kicking
I just bought my bitch some new titties
You take out these pictures, you bogus
We gon’ turn your ass until you tollin'
We gon’ ice your ass down ‘til you folded
Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
Make some bad bitches fuck my brody
I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle
They got lots of bread, I’ma call Butta

She say she want a cat
So I went bought the Jag
And it matches the bag
Make these bitches look sad
I just dyed my hair grey
Like a motherfucking dad
And you know that we feastin’
I just couldn’t get fat
Mind fuck ‘em when I speak
Take the Farrakhan notes
My rock wrist is on gold
Like the new Audi spokes
Niggas scared to they soul
When I pull up with folks
I’ma take out the trojans put it right in her throat
And you know I stay with them AKs and I should’ve caught ‘em
Mind fuck 'em, he shouldn't have played 'bout the butta
I only play inside the cover
Like a kid, make them play with each other
And I'm ridin' round with a real bad bitch
Oops I meant girl, cover

I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AP bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
I come through there fresh like John Lennon
My wrist a haircut, I’m not kidding
They dig all the shit that I’m kicking
I just bought my bitch some new titties
You take out these pictures, you bogus
We gon’ turn your ass until you tollin'
We gon’ ice your ass down ‘til you folded
Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it

Now, you can start my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a little closer, I might know you
Andale, andale!
How the fuck I ... when there is a runway?

I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
Should I leave, should I leave? Should I stay? Should I go?
My plant trees right now, no matter what you do
I miss you, I’m leaving but I’ll be right back
I wish I could fly like Michael Jordan

Space cadet flyin' on the jet, unexpect
That Texas tea spillin' on my jeans, outfit
Bitch lean on me
Ride through the hood, no ski on me
Snake life, a whole lotta skeets in me
Blood like a vampire teeth in me
Jumanji on my feet
Ridin' through the hood in the Jag or the Jeep
She know Young Thugga gon spit
She know Young Thugga a beast
Then I come back to my senses like

I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
Should I leave, should I leave? Should I stay? Should I go?
Then I come back to my senses like

Get the fuck up out that YSL sofa
Get on the floor
I would like for you to know
Your popcorn poppin'
I'm like, "Rich Homie, stop it"
Yeah your boy trending topic
I'll go stompin' like Kunta la Kinte
Fuck, trap spots tucked down with the mouses
No not a club but her booty is bouncin'
I live my life stoned, no mountain
I'm gon' drink you like a Fanta
Then she switch up like Hannah Montana
Couldn't ever understand her
Come back to your senses

I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
Should I stay, should I stay, should I go, should I go?
Should I stay, should I stay?
I was sittin' in the dark waitin' on the lock
Should I stay, should I stay, should I go, should I go
Should I go?

And she like to hold my hand we in Lenox
She want to show out on all these bitches at M's
I know she bad for Young Thugger Thugger black cannon

Baby you a turn on
Imma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby you a turn on
I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby you a turn on
I've been slowly waiting

Choppers gon' chop and I swear to God I am a slime I'ma shoot at your spin

Caught me a big ol' lil' body, lil' bitch and you know it's the Benz
Suck on my dick, baby suck on my dick 'til you got a big chin
Soon as I fuck on your ho, boy you know I'm gon' make her back bend

My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

I don't talk to 12, I don't like conversation

And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

Deviled up and I'm Kid Cudi ghost ridin' with you lady
Sucking on my dick like 8 Mile, She choke her like Slim Shady

Longway

If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us

She want to come to the bed, she see this Versace

Cause your body is a fool, and your booty look like jewels
And I just want to see you
Cause you shave it and crave it, I eat it when you bathe it
I like it when you wear lazy, bent over like you praying
With babies, no Deangelo, but girl get naked
When you leave I wish that I could copy it and paste it
I'm riding 'round with stoners, and all my blunts are laced, ayy

Maybe my car cause the next year's datin's on it
TIP, I'm a young king, please put the cape on me
Thug go in, curfew
I'm on a lot of tracks, they say the Thug startin' to irk you
And ya'll eatin' shit that's baby food, burp you
If Wayne flow is kush, then my shit is on purple
But my flow is sick, it's dyin', I need a donor
And I'm so great, when I leave I need a corner
I didn't ride a wheel so that Phantom gone need an owner
And your ho be totally screamin' she's not a moaner
I told Wayne I was ready for the paper like Usher
He said cool, sit back, stay away from busters
Now Thug got the big head, I am a gusher
I am not the best but I am better than others

And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top you shall achieve with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

Sippin' on this mud got me bobbin' and leanin'
I hopped out the porch just like Skooly
Me and Young Thug on this one, it's a movie
Pull up in that drop head, mouths drop like droopy
Now they sayin' I got the big head like Stewie

Now I ride drop head flyin' down Cleveland
Whoever thought me and my crew be ridin' horses
Paneramic car, that mean back to back Porsches
They said I fell off cause I ain't brought the new whip through
But when I bring it back, I'mma pay that bitch crip blue
And still post up on the ave with my boy big blue
And a hundred young niggas and they all screamin' Su Woo
I went to church just to chill in the pulpit
And Mario got shot, yea that's still some bullshit
But Thug, I can't let it handle you
I'mma take you off to Cleveland, aka the Zoo

And my bitch look like a barbie
I have a new spot, Houston no Marcus
Nigga you don't wanna start it

Bought the new Bentley coupe, the roof I had to fuckin' kill it
Bought my bitch the new Audi, we have to switch cause I like it
When I don't like to drive, we bought the jet so I can fly it
They say I'm sexy but the face look kinda mean so don't fright it
And niggas know I'm shootin', they say they don't? Then they lyin'
And if they say they shot back they a front
The only niggas shot that was the rats
So shoutout to the rats
I'm the realest, no frat
I'm sorry I had to kick it like a punt, yeah

And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top you will succeed with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me

I got ice on my wrist, your girl couldn't resist
I pour the drinks, she told me no
I told her, "girl, I insist"
I smell like kush, you Creed cologne
I have half of bag of this shit
The bag so heavy when we shop, my girl be dragging this shit
I got a girl from the 6, she helped me out on a leak
Gave me ten bands as a gift, and sealed the deal with a kiss
I got a girl from Gwinnett, you know her daddy is rich
But she keep coming to the hood without no panties and shit
I ain't no regular nigga, can't date no average bitch
I let her hang with them boys, she swear she grow on the clique
Pick diamonds stuffed in the navel, if can't re-watch on them tits
Look like a bag of money, bag of Kush, a bag of them bricks

We can ride around the city with it
Hit the gas, no breaks all day, oh yea yea
We can ride around the city with it
Hit the gas, no breaks
Hit the gas, no breaks, baby girl
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it

I really, really run around
16K to get a Tummy Tuck
Surrounded by them bosses with a lot of funds
Bought that bitch a Phantom, cause she wanted one
Soon as I hit the door, she tearin' down the stairs
Soon as I hit the room, she tearing down my belt
Soon as I enter her, I feel her body melt
The thing is super-weird, I feel like Michael Phelps
I'm the last foe for my main ho
I buy her real gold, she no longer frost
Pinocchio bam we straight up by the bow
Dear, dear President, you know my main hoes

We can ride around the city with it
Hit the gas, no breaks all day, oh yea yea
We can ride around the city with it
Hit the gas, no breaks
Hit the gas, no breaks, baby girl
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city
We can ride around the city with it



Hold up, homes, I got my gold on, homes
I roll with real life robbers but can't do no wrong
I got a jet black tone, all black foams
And I might crack your dome like I just cracked my iPhone
Twenty thousand every pocket so my belt can't help it
Green and white sweater, bitch, but I'm no Celtic
Chilling in the M-Town, but I'm not Elvis
A nigga went broke and his main ho pregnant
Gucci cash got low bet the whole crest felt it
I snatch a nigga chain out, hey let's melt it
Got lit for sixty bricks so I just MapQuest it
I smoke blunts for dinner and I drink lean for breakfast
I put four O's of lean in a lil bitty Mistic

Yep, motherfuck, yep motherfuck
Money talk, credit talk
Guwop, my blood brother

Put your Rolie up, put your motherfucking Rolie up
No smoking on that bush like Magnolia, bro
Got bands on top of bands, I'm up like Folgers, bro
Young Thug backstabbing, I ain't brabbin'
Your ho want a lot of wood like a cabin
Even though I keep a smile, need to stop this madness

Yep, motherfuck, yep motherfuck
Money talk, credit talk
Guwop, my blood brother

We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team

Aye Thugger Thugger roll up while I pour up the jelly
Sauced up like spaghetti, my bitch fine as Halle Berry

And make that pussy sing to me... R Kelly
You niggas funnier than Jim Carrey
While I'm grindin' for my nicks, call me Raymond Felton
Drop a juice and get a quarter back like Jim Kelly
Choppers with machetes, I don't think you ready

Smokin' out the pound while your bitch goin' down

But I'm active when I'm in the Panamera
My niggas leanin', your niggas dreamin'
We Lakers, we got bitches screamin'
And all of 'em bad, none of 'em decent
When you think of the Lakers, you think of Kobe
So my niggas got 2 guns for the niggas that owe me
I far fetch
Schoolin' these niggas, give 'em Artest, now they want beef
Plenty women in the sea, like Derek, I fish when I need
I'm just tryna eat that whole meal, I'm grindin' for my own deal
We don't just get on the board, we break the board like O'Neal
I started trappin', but better at rappin'
All I had to do was make it happen, got sick of the Magic
And shout out to Jamal for the trap, you can't finesse a finesser
Gave you six racks, you should go buy your girl a real necklace
I could have fucked her, cause I'm ballin' like a Laker
I'm after this Kareem, ain't got no time for these haters

It's Young Thug bitch
My world
Try not to get putted out

Hop out the G4, now I'm back to the basics
I thank God that I am not racist
Shout out to Wayne cause he is not basic
He got me on my turtle time, no Matrix
And I promise I'll ball, no patriot
And I'll be at the finish line, slick waiting
Which is at the tip top, big Akron
But if I fall off I'll die, so I'm pacin'
And I've been in and out the bank bitch
While ya'll assholes been in and out a tank bitch
I think I'm on my Wayne cake shit
But we smoke the same weed, the Wayne stank shit
And I'm the top tire, no innertube
And I'll eat till you're sour, like lemon food
Cause I'm the motherfuckin' boss and you're a middle dude
And you're just like the bricks, we get rid of you
And I should make a pledge of allegiance
Cause these niggas small, they ain't my region
I stay away from ya'll when you niggas this bleedin'
Cause I don't know if you know me like I'm takin' the pleadin'
We in the buildin', the niggas that are outback
I throw the children at your bitch and she caught that
And I'm the boss so, yea I Marshall Faulk that
And my partner on my falkjack
I'm at the top, no lie
And I be in the motherfuckin' sky, don't fly
And if I can't stay around ya, I'mma run right through ya
But if you get right bitch, I might new, new ya

Concrete jungle and shit
We been havin' this shit man
Long, long time ago, I promise you

Money on your head, now you need a paper proof route
Niggas at me, man I need a bulletproof booth
And what ya'll call goons, we call goof troops
And them hoes we smashin', ya'll call 'em new, new
Ridin' with the 50 cal, old man protected
How the song got Universal still neglectin'?
Oops I mean select me
Skooly didn’t forget me
I fuck with Juggman shit, respect he get plenty
And I be with my dogs like a hunter
We be blowin' racks while they starvin' out for hunger
And they say I look good, but I'm mean, sexy monster
They wanna make me mad but Ty told me to stay humble
And they ask me why I still respect Jimfro
Cause he the motherfucker that made me, is you crazy?
And he asked me why I had two babies
Cause I ain't lettin' a fuck nigga clone me, is you crazy?
But if a nigga play with them babies
He gone need the motherfuckin' army and the navy
Cause the ROC crew move by the babies
And we got a 1000 guns in Haiti
And Skooly hopped out the Porsche
And I be ridin' round lurkin', me and your dad
Or should I be sayin' the zan man kids?
Cause we be high like the school at Harvard of Spanish  , ya dig?



I'm passin hunneds to the bong, nigga
You know that's nothin' but some pawns, nigga
That finger lickin' and my palm itchin'

My uncle that died is amazin'
You see all the looks on my faces



No domestic violence I put my hands on you
As soon as I walked in she like 'them bands on you'
And if you act right girl, them bands might land on you
You got me feeling like Future I like the stand on you
And you just keep going, going, going
And this money keep blowin', blowin', blowin'
And you just keep going
And this money keep blowin'

And I'm like round and round and round and round we go
All this money on this floor, girl you can go and touch your toes

I'll coax it outta you, I'll coax it outta you
I hope you feel better, why?
Cause the jewelry had you sick, tired of callin' you
When my lifestyle is smoke stank blunts
And ride around with them choppers
And the cars full of niggas like Rastas
Stay on mollys and them my partners
What the fuck you mean baby girl? Ca$h Out the man
And if you ever thinking about robbin', you'll need 1000 plans
But I love you and I trust you

Get the fuck on with distractions, I'm way too dope not to have it
Rather say "bye" and stay fly than stay a part and me die
Some shit it just ain't no sheeshin', either you with it or not
If you gon' measure my bad more than you measure my good
Just think it coulda been worse, I could be dead in the hood

Listen to my music, I can put somethin' in your ear
Pussy nigga play I bop-brrrat-bop-bop their beard
Your mama seen you get bop-brrrat-bop-bopped then she teared

We turnt up, we turnt up

I used to smack this ho, her name was Skittles
Her ass was so fat, it used to jiggle
She took one too many skittles, now she limps
And I ain't fucking wit' her no mo' cause she UGH
Even back then my diamonds were so BRR
Fast forward, they still clear and I'm still here
I cook the dope good, call me Chef Boy-ar-dee
Remember back then, they asked me "What you do?
The kingpin will rob you man this shit a foo'
Red bottom shoes, give they ass the blues
Columbian co-Mexican connection
Got a Russian rifle, shoot you while ya' shittin'
Christian Louboutins on, they piranha skin
Guwop

My bitch said she 'bout to leave
She said that I don't cater to her needs
I'm in the trap screaming "NIGGA WHAT YOU NEED?"
Bought a Rolex that I don't really need
Big smoke with me, the whole pound of weed
Big drink with me, the whole pint of lean

Ever since I signed with Gucci

I drink that Actavis, your Sprite look like it got Starburst or Skittles
Two iPhone 5, pussy nigga, stuff a pill with the killers
If you've me mad, I'ma come and babysit your little sisters
I got that Act- that Act- that Act- that pour it up then I sip
I cook that work on Christmas for you, I'm a Pillsbury deal
I mix my lean with my Sprite, that's a Pillsbury bill
I get it
Them digits
Let's get it
I got cutie foreign bitches gettin' it
They whip it
I shove my ass inside of them Bentley's
I ride it
I don't make lefts, I only turn right
I'm back in the Spyder like yikes, my neck full of Christ
We gon' boom, boom, boom
Ain't no spots or rooms
I drop them bands on that Doom
And I'm Boosie on Zoom
My nick name, "Cocaine Boom"
I'm cookin' them coons
I don't care none 'bout goin' to prison
My children got rooms

My bitch said she 'bout to leave
She said that I don't cater to her needs
I'm in the trap screaming "NIGGA WHAT YOU NEED?"
Bought a Rolex that I don't really need
Big smoke with me, the whole pound of weed
Big drink with me, the whole pint of lean

But a cracker got five thousand, you would snag at it
You niggas stupid dumb, which makes me stupid smart
And they be waiting one play while I be playing my part
My diamonds ricochet, them diamonds looking dark
I be in the crowd with my fans, I have a groupie heart

Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left
Thousand dollar step, I’m in that 911
Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's

Tearing on the block, I don’t care about no cops
I ain’t gonna never stop, they gonna race me to the top
I’m in that 911, just don’t panic
Whip it all up out that bowl, water, Titanic
I think my car need a band aid, I’m bleeding through the streets
Me and DK on the autograph, my car get a lease
Ain’t nobody supposed to have it, I snatched it
I gave 'em mostly green like a salad, not average
Come across the ocean on a boat, then a train
I’m not trying to go to prison but I’m blowing out the brains
No shirt with a scarf on my head like Sudan
Got a bank full of cash money, Baby and Wayne, dang

Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left

Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's

Brand new AP, came from OG double D
R-I-fucking-P, 5 mill' spent in the streets
You know we gonn' spaz, we gonn' kill her to find out
But we street bees, we don’t have no honey hide out
Bleeding like a fool, Memphis Mark, OG boo dirty
Just hit my line when they ask I say “I know you heard me”
OG Double D left everybody’s streets working
I miss him, I got RIP OG Double D on all the birdies
Feeling like Ken, hundred dollar bills on Tonka Trucks
Riding round with so many sins, I ain’t gonn' tell 'em all that
The pussy nigga hit the pen, I ain’t gonn' tell 'em fall back
Catch me riding in the 9 11, banging fall back

Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left

A hundred for a shave, fuck them designer cuts

You remind me of a Jeep

When we took a ride, we slid on them guys
Too gangsta to disguise it

No brainer, I'm like I'm on a Xanny
Shoot an AK with a Patek

Young nigga whole body tatted
YSL, a nigga want static?
No plug, left 'em in a casket
All these niggas tryna pimp

Moonwalking like I'm Michael J
Jeffery a real OG
Well, the bitch 23, ooh-wee
23 , Michael Michael J
I'ma take my talents to outer space
Top bankrolls outta J's
YSL clearing out the bank
Imma put the barrell in his face
And imma treat the freak like bae
YSL beat a nigga case

You remind me of a Jeep
When I took a ride, ride on them guys
Left 'em hypnotized
Girl, you remind me of a Jeep
When we took a ride, we slid on them guys
Too gangsta to disguise it

I ain't wearing Robin nigga basket
Fifth grade ballin like a Maverick
Pussy nigga steal a nigga swag
Real talent never got the chance
Still wearing platinum like a king
20/20 bubble I ?}
Young nigga ballin' out the jail
Big diamonds Adult Swim
YSL sign it on the ten
Pull the body shore with the shrimps
New York whore with the brim
Another day whole nother time piece
If she ain't a ten she a dime piece
Hundred thousand dollars on a fine piece
If you look for diamond for you'll find me

You remind me of a Jeep
When I took a ride, ride on them guys
Left 'em hypnotized
Girl, you remind me of a Jeep
When we took a ride, we slid on them guys
Too gangsta to disguise it

In the booth with money in my hand

I heard love don't last forever, but I'ma change
That lil aquafina change weather
I'm bangin' with that damn Baretta
And I'mma bang, bang anything about that cheddar, yeah
But really I allow whatever
I'mma bang, bangin' bout that mozzarella
I'm bangin' like I'm not a rapper
I could care what you do with yours as long as I got mine
A rich nigga so she miss it


Mixin' purple with the green like a turtle
Went in for my baby
Bitch I'm goin' in for my lady


Thats the mood thats the motto
Twenty bad bitches, like to feed em seafood
Twenty real niggas

I heard love don't last forever
That lil aquafina change weather
I'm bangin' with that damn Baretta
And I'mma bang, anything about that cheddar
I'mma bang bout that mozzarella

Got a tool on me in the Wraithy and the Tahoe

I heard love don't last forever
That lil aquafina change weather
I'm bangin' with that damn Baretta
And I'mma bang, anything about that cheddar
I'mma bang bout that mozzarella



We got London On Da Track

Ride it like a Power Ranger

Buy my old girl some bling
I got the whole world watching me
Suck the dick like jollys, whee
I'm gettin' cheese, yeah that cottage cheese
I'm just seeing what the eyes can see
I just wanna see it ride around like that US army
Hermès on my boxers, rock the latest Gucci women belt
Designer shit, I'm fiendin' for it
Drippin' ounces like all my Balmains tight
Ring, ring, ring the phone an' you get red bottoms
Kingpin numbers, I'm not talkin' ringtones
Lookin' at transitions in my mug shots


Woop, make it hurricane Katrina
I got some water like I'm on the damn dock
I had a bankroll inside my lunch box
I point the stick at his feet and make him hop
Your pocket on pancake, like the IHOPs





My bro's song, nigga

If that's my nigga, I will bleed for him
If he has arms, I put some grams inside the leaf for him
I catch your bitch, control her like a leash on her
My whoadie got lots of keys like Alicia on him
Gra-gra-gra shut down with like gun Travis
Lotta bandz on your set like you live in Aspen

You know Thug and Bloody Jay about that action
I know she a Cinderella but you keep 'em out your business
They be crying for spaghetti while my pockets sittin' on lettuce
Count my fetti, riding on a bike, your bitch on the pegs
I want M&M's instead, and by that I'll leave you red



Riding with all these straps they call it paranoia
They say I'm paranoid, kick a nigga in the ass, hemorrhoids
That's them 'Anybody did it?' boys
Are you niggas making any noise?

Hey Miss Catherine Johnson I'm ridin' for you baby
With a shoulder strapped chopper and nina my baby

Cause gettin' this paper is so contagious
I'm gone work this bitch until they serve them work paper

Believe the shit that I saw
Woke up everyday, wanted more
Shit that I done did, if I could I do it all again
That shit made me who I'm am
That shit got me all these mils
All these days I was starvin', back touchin' my stomach
Daydreamin', wonderin', how I'mma get me some money
Slipped ten toes in that trap, finessed niggas out sacks
I did shit that I ain't proud of, still I wouldn't take it back
Nowadays I take my thoughts, then I'm down like a wrestler
Work hard like a slave but live better than the master
And what we do it wrong, why it feel so right?
Thank God everyday, I don't know how I'm still alive
My life, my life, I earned my stripes
My life, my life, I grew up trife
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
Streets labeled me the Dun dealer

My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life

King slime, triple cross king
Trunk full of Yao Ming
I stretch the work out, like an athlete
My shooter air it out, watch a track meet
I turn ya'll niggas to meat
I used to rap the things in the inner-tube
Now I kick this rich nigga shit on pro tools
My life I done sold them bricks
My life I done hit them licks
My life is so high risk
And I'm prayin' for Bloody Jay
Because that nigga wild with that AK
And ask Thug, and ask Slug
My shooter got a shooter nigga
Rock put me on this rap shit
So he took me out that trap shit


Me and my ho were arguin'
Money was lookin' funny
She was like you trippin' baby
You know I wouldn't do nothin' brazy
So I sat down and thought about how long ago I caught them caps
Now my homie done think I'm trippin' cause my money surrounded by traps, oh
I got mice bitin' through my shit
And ya my diamonds are so white
It looks like lights off in my shit
And I be high as a son of a bitch
So ya my flight just might be risk
And she vibin' to this shit
She know I'll eat her alive
And my weed strong
You can fart by me
And when you smell it
Let Young Thugger tell it
Couple bands on my feet
I'm a motherfuckin' army man cause all I want is green
My life I been in them traps
My life I done took niggas life
My life you wouldn't get by
I'm with my big homie Jay and my big homie Rock
Instead of them big homie stocks
And we pull big homie guap

These niggas wan' pop us
These niggas can't do nun' but stalk us
I'm not from New York and I'm not 50 Cent but these bitches know I got the power
These bitches know I'm Eddie Bauer, I'll kill em
Then send your lil' muhfuckin' mama some flowers!
Send your lil' mama some roses
Get me the racks you a slow bitch
YSL, you know the slogan
You waste time, don't pop on your rollies
You living life bogus
These bitches stay bogus, but I'ma stay focus and focus
I fuck her- I fuck on her face, then I bust like a coconut
Come on, girl. Yeah I love you,'Til I fuck you
Got the hustle, big ol' muzzle, and I'm buffing
Bitch I'm the terminator
Go round round round
They come round, they hatin'
You smoke that base and you smoking that basic
And that's why

I keep the Kushy on me
I keep them Xannies on me
This not your average with meee!
This not why they started a beef
Then someone gon' end up deceased

I get head for the low!
She get that bread on the low
Pull up in something they don't know
Give em them racks and they know
Nigga the loafs
Yeah I get them loafs
Took off with no overdose
As far as shit goes
Suck on my Johnson, no Magic
Diamonds they dancing
Fuck her so hard she need bandages
She's in the pocket like sandwiches
I like 'em thick just like Manwiches

Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah!



They killin' little niggas, it ain't no love in these streets
Even bitches can get it, that's why I thug with my heat
I'm a real thug nigga, stand ten toes flat on my feet
They killin' little niggas, they killin' little niggas

And if you play Duey, will kill you, bitch nigga
And I'll be on your ho like clothes
And I swear if you play with any one of my crew
I'll be in your mouth like golds
But I have a goal and it is to get rich and die old
And I have a sick wrist, it got a cold
And my ears are Atlantic, which means pros
And I swear I ain't ever, ever gone play with ya'll niggas
I swear I will go and get the K for ya'll niggas
And walk up on ya and say hey to ya'll niggas
Then cock that motherfucker and spray on ya'll niggas


And Big'll come and get his ass outta there
And we'll tie you up to the top floor
And let the young crips come and move you like a rocking chair
Cleveland Ave, we rocking now
Four Seasons can't stop it now
What you mean I fuck with them? I said I fuck with them
Okay, I slept with him which means I fuck with him
I fuck with him, no homo though
And if you have no cash, no show dough
Last night I went by myself, solo dolo
Duey talkin' 'bout give him somethin', I'm like oh no
Buk talkin' 'bout give him somethin',, double oh no


Okay, the outro of this motherfucker is.... the end!

Young Thug getting back?
And the chopper super long

Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of track
,they be like "Appreciate you, Young Thug"
And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

Damn, and every time I thought about quitting
It felt crazy to the Thug, like something was missing
I had to sneak and do my thing, cause I didn't have permission
Now I'm in your back yard lurkin, pre-mission
I told them keep it 200, I blast for it
But he still keeping it 100, like his dashboard
The we ain't had nothing for credit, only cash for it
And if he sweet, rob him without a mask for it
And fuck you, I can decide myself
And don't mention racks, cause I provide myself
I'm standing next to the best so I'm beside myself
And The flow sick, but the chopper guide myself

Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of tracks
They be like "Appreciate you, Young Thug"
And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

And they be like "Thug, where the fuck you go?"
I am way up here
Big fat racks in front of me like a chauffeur
And my son scared of me, he say "The mink look like a bear"
So that's why everywhere I go, women just look and stare
But my car is not rare
Meaning I pay double and the ring cost a couple
And I am not weak, but the Ferrari doesn't struggle
And I guess I'm a baller, because the Feds say I double
And I am such a winner, oops, my fault, I'm still winning
And you such a beginner, oops, my fault, you still beginning
And I get money on my own, while you steady depending
Believe me, I am not kidding

Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of tracks
They be like "Appreciate you, Young Thug"
And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

I stack 50s and 100s because I like them
They don't want to lick him no more, they trying to bite him
I'm 18, day grown women, they trying to mic him
Plus the fellas mad, they angry, they think they fright him
Plus I made them think that I'm broke, I had to psych them
I went and caught the Super Bowl ring, I tried to light them
I blew the bubble kush in their face, I tried to kite them
When I left the club with they bitch, I goodnight them

Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of tracks

And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

Smokin' kush blunts while I double cup

Red beam in my residence
Protect it up like the president
Say the wrong word and gone kill shit
MMG what I represent

Still hand in hand with that white shit
Big bells and them clean bricks
Turn a regular bitch to a bad bitch
Drink a whole nine to half a brick

I had to tell my brother Thugger
She callin' my phone all the time
She say that she wanna spend time
I think the she lyin'
She wasting me time
Lemmie ask you sumthin' Thug
Damn!



I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a motherfuckin' stoner

I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss

I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss

I just drank with YSL just like a f- boss

Just like a f- boss, just like a

Thugger Thugger, you

I want Michael Jackson land, ohh

Aww I'mma cash out

I'm high as hell ain't got no satellites on me

I tell that bitch I feel like Fabo

I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo

I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo

I feel like Fabo, I feel just like Fabo


Bankhead

Hear my song way from Y-T-C-R-O-B-S-M-M, now we YSL venom

Slime Thugger wit it, Slime DK wit it

Slime Wicced wit it, Slime Mondo wit it

Slime Slugger with it, Slime Bubba wit it

Slime Check wit it

Count hundreds and fifties off everyone's city

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a motherfuckin' stoner

I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss

I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss

I just drank with YSL just like a f- boss

Just like a f- boss, just like a

Running that money up, like ya 'bout to start trial

When you beat the case, turn into a stoner child

We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet

Everybody stoned, weed, lean

Every time I walk inside the club I see everybody looking

You know I'm a stoner I love drugs and I can't never be tooken

And you can suck my banana, but I won't eat your pudding

So come a lil closer, my bitch won't know ya

Andalé andalé andalé


My glasses are metro no blood off your chest

I control ya ho like net and flex

Your bitch at my dinner she wet like a fish

I took off her three legs, T-Rex

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

I'm a motherfuckin' stoner

I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss

I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss

I just drank with YSL just like a f- boss

Just like a f- boss, just like a

I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo

I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo

I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo

I feel just like



To be transcribed, when Young Thug releases the official tracklist



I like the way you make that thang roll like a roly poly
I like the fact you naked for cash and you ain't scared to show
I like the way you make that thing roll when you roll your head
I like the way you roll me but tonight you gotta hold that head
From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back

From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back

Come here bae don't you run from me
You want some cash or something
You want a jag or some
Want a couple bags or some
Make it rain on em, make it lil wayne on em
Buy you real real gold, major pain on em
You gotta boss now, you ain't gotta stalk now
Fuck the cost, you ain't bleedin' no more
You in the loft now
Got real bankrolls
I'm good on Slauson

Ain't trippin on being a blood with these young tenders
Got a lot of bankrolls on me I'mma a winner
You the natural, you the natural

I like the way you make that thang roll like a roly poly
I like the fact you naked for cash and you ain't scared to show
I like the way you make that thing roll when you roll your head

From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back
Tonight we havin' sex aye
From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back

Go head bae, I'm done with you but it was fun with you
I bought Ferragamos for you
My night was ? with you
Bought all the bottles for you
Brought all my money for you
This Beautiful bitch that talks shit
When you say something stupid around her
She don't like the cubans around her
And she need to quit, but its a boss bitch, shit
I gotta step my game up pointers on my wrist, now glist'
Wake up wake up, I think my heart done felt enough
Speed it up like rollie pollie, ollie

I like the way you make that thing roll like a roly poly
I like the fact you naked for cash and you ain't scared to show
I like the way you make that thing roll when you on your head
I like the way you roll me but tonight you gotta hold that head
From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back
Tonight we havin' sex aye
From da back from da back from da back from da back
From da back from da back from da back



I went from nothing to having it all
Nigga was small but now I be tall
Now I be pullin' up outside the mall
Licking the pussy and licking the balls
I'm topping 'em all
Nigga, I'm topping 'em all
I'm topping 'em all
And I be dropping 'em all

Used to be po', now I be paid, used to lick hoes, now I be laid
Taking the dick, now I got AIDS, making the bricks, Imma stack what I made
Pull up in a wheelchair 'cause I do not care
Niggas finna stare 'cause of highlights in my hair
I'm up on the stairs, cash up in my pocket
Gun up in my fucking dro', I ain't afraid to cock it
Haters mailing me, Imma finna block it
And I got photos of penis up in my wallet and up in my locket
Got all my cash from jotting my raps, nigga I'm getting a lot in my crack
Made up a mill, I ain't stopping at that and I'm not gay 'cause I'm not in with that


I'm burning a hun'ed, I'm ripping a thou', I'm getting that cream like I'm milking a cow
You live in the past and he living in now, I live in future, I'm quicker than yaaaaaaaawl
Nigga, finna spit a bar
Use to ride a bike now I'm buying Vauxhall Corsas
Going pas' the border with a frickin' ton of orders
Sipping the cum and I'm hitting the drum and I shit in your mum, you listen to Young
My trigger will spray and a nigga ain't gay, I don't care what I say, never bitten my tongue





Before you.....
