Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

My baby drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
Shit, you never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday
I ain't invited, despite it
I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Me and your daughter got a special thing goin' on
You say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever, forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin' what happened to the feelin' that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school
And graduation

"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And I knew you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
‘Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year two to the G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sho
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
Cause we don't know how

Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all
We've been together
Oh, we've been together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes
Love the exception?
So why oh why oh, why oh why oh
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Hey ya! Uh-oh
Don't want to meet your daddy, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want you in my Caddy, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Don't want to meet your mama, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh-oh
I'm, I'm, I'm
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest

Hey, alright now
Now what's cooler than being cool?
I say what's cooler than being cool?
Alright, alright, alright, alright
We're gonna break this back down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor! Ah, here we go!
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now all the Beyonce's and Lucy Lius
And babydolls, get on the floor
You know what to do Shake it, sh-shake it
Oh, you know what to do!
Shake it, sh-shake it Shake it, sh-shake it
Oh, you know what to do! Shake it like a Polaroid picture

See, Caroline, all the guys would say
But mighty fine only got you somewhere
Half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this
You'd need a golden calculator
The time it took to look inside
And realize
That real guys go for real
Down to Mars girls
Haha, yeah

I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like
Boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like

See she's the reason for the word
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror
And crash, crash
Crash into a ditch
Just playing
She needs a golden calculator
The time it takes to look inside
Yeah

Yeah, I

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Tricking off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasing cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way
No way

Crazy bitch

Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie, and sometimes "y"
Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever

Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know, how to work bread, cheese and dough
From scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge,  meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
More than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast's Aquemini, another black experience

The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
'Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-black, boy, we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme, we bust back
Get-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat? You can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin André Ben, welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends

Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay

One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop a train
Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Bet I be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9, Anno Domini, anything goes, be what you wanna be
Long as you know consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ah!

Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something

Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend, dyin' to geek
OutKast bumping up and down the street
Slantback, Cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep
75 MC's freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should have bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should have held back, but you throwed a punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turn my back on my kids for them
Should have hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, plan it, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, coming straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pulling off a belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish 'fore I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, hah!

Bob your head, rag top
Power music, electric revival

Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; so I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause

Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'mma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass 'round eight-ish, I know you'll be there for me, girl

Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

And we are...
The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my...
The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh ooh...
I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
Compatible, created in the attic
And my my...
But ooh, ooh...

Damn, damn, damn, James

Dickie shorts, Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga, where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out here come the folk, "Damn"
Oh, Lord

As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens
Reminiscent of Charles, a lil' discotheque
Nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia a lil' spot where
Young men and young women go to experience
They first li'l taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there—well perhaps once
But I was so engulfed in the Olde E
I never made it to the door, you speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems
And troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set it Off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if
Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
And one nigga don' took his shirt off talkin' 'bout
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation

Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute

Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja

Uh-huh, uh-huh, baby, yeah, yeah
Cut it up, oh, oh, oh!
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, baby, uh-huh
Uh-cracka, lacka-lacka-lacka, cracka, lacka-lacka-lacka
Uh-huh, baby, uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Baby, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh

Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk

Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn, we, the committee, gon' burn it down
But us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, "Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'"
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station, here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' with it
But I'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
'Cause I thought it would be jammin' but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, "It's weak" is the last quote
That I want to hear when I'm goin' down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, "Them niggas earned that crown", but until then

It's just major right here you know what I'm saying, yo son, my niggas, your niggas is on it man, straight up man
We handling the earth right now you niggas don't even know
For sure
You know what I mean? If it wasn't for us tryna enlighten y'all niggas with all types of flows and flavors, the game wouldn't be the same
You gotta keep it innovative and new, creative. You know what I'm sayin'? Some people don't wanna hear the same thing old over and over
That's right
Straight up, pay up, pay up man
From East Point to Shaolin, y'all better know that, yeah!
Hit this Henny

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like "Freeze!"
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me, I'm out this bitch

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls, before them blunts got crunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, "Momma I want to sing
But momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dick now"
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82, me and you like Tony Toni Tone

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something "Hey man, you remember me from school?" "No not really"
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, "What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made"
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat
Like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too"
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now

It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story rap now

Grandmama – Keisha, Keisha! Cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!
Keisha – Uh, Alright
Grandmama – Baby don’t be scared, it’s gonna be alright. It’s just the Lord doin' his work, okay?

Yeah, yeah it goes like this right here
Like uh, niggas always be hollering "peace"
You know what I'm saying, "peace my brother"
Peace this, peace that, you know what I'm saying but
Every time I uh try to get a peace of mind
Niggas try to get a piece of mine
So I gotta grab my piece

It's the return of the gangster, thanks ta'
Them niggas that's on that blow
That run up in your crib
Which contains your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
They do not want to hear it
Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit, get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas that think you soft
And say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches, and switches, and hoes, and clothes, and weed
Let's talk about time travelin', rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin', get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that got them kids
That got enough to buy an ounce
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never
Seein' light 'til they end up being like yo' sorry ass
Robbin' niggas in broad day as daylight get down
Them niggas that get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?
When y'all gon' break up? When y'all gon' wake up?
Nigga I'm feelin' better than ever what's wrong with you
You get down!

Man, a nigga don't want no trouble
A playa just want to kick back with my gators off
And watch my lil' girl blow bubbles
But still ready to rhyme, standing my ground never back down
Willin' to rob steal and kill any thang that threatens mine
But good luck couldn't be bought, see
Many a fights had to be fought, G
For a nigga to ride these Vogues
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck is gon' be the first nigga we attack
Don't want that, but it comes though, most of the time when you don't know
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that slow dough
We worked for everything we have and gon' stick up for
Each other, like we brothers from another mother
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers
And never the nut huggin' punk motherfuckers
So quit spreading them rumors
We ain't Club Nouveau

From front to back street, listen, we on a mission
To get right, workin' street corner in the midnight
Picture the scene, these fiends with fire
Ten dollar dreams, scheme, for a sack of that, believe that
I'm wit' whateva like Wheatstraw
Stuck servin' my cocaine raw
Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back
Twenty over, now that's mo' money to get
Slick, we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught
But time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short
That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin'
But I make moves, shake them tricks up out they shoestrings
Be more precise when we do things
'Cause life is like shakin' the dice, but I buck back twice
Like five-deuce, fo'-trey, okay

I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops

Shit, cops and robbers, niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin', you ain't knowin' how much money you spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out
When you was broke though they was missin'
Now you ridin' 'bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it
Now where your crew at? Yeah

Ay, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs
We better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangsta-ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talkin' 'cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo'
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back
'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin'?
And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave

This is uh… a lil'… tune that we composed back on the first album
I know a lot of y'all, uh, playas out there thought we wasn't gon' come back at y'all with this thang here, but… it go a lil' some' like this!

Oh yes I love her like Egyptian, want a description?
My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems
Thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call the body
Now everybody got it, had it
Talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes
Even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Smoking an ounce of weed and every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception
Looking into your eyes I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan
'Cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame
A nigga don’t even know your name, it’s a shame
You cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale
While you other hoes be Dumb and Dumber
Yeah, you know what I’m saying

See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl
'Cause most of the girls that we was liking in high school
Now they dyking
Having no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be
I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he, faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like "Yeah, nigga, right"
But you gave me your number anyway
You were on the talcum
Powder — how's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impo-ssible
We were both the same age, but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page, but in
The same book of life, so I'd page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be
Heaven or hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the Dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
"Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?"
W-W-W-Well, yes and no
Yes, we were selling it
But no, it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled "ho!"
Meanwhile, the video starts playing
BET, college radio, and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve 7 digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied 'see you later' when he got the good news
That's life shit
Now, I'm 19 with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop-pop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more, follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you, tell me then I'll double back
But keep in mind, at the time "keep it real" was the phrase
Silly once said now, but those were the days
When Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks
Made you wanna, drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak
Moment, on went myself and Big Boi
Well, you knew him as 'Twan
That's right, you were around before this shit begun
When 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak
Girls used to say, "Y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?"
And I'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling
"No, I'm from Atlanta, baby
He from Savannah, maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes"
She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
15-love, fit like glove
Description is like 15 doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?
Enough about me, how's about you?
How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note
Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see I'd balled out, and 'fore I fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor, staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread, never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas, and macaroni niggas, imposters
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now you know her as Erykah "On and On" Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone, "Why you
Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed"
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name
We're young, in love, in short we had fun
No regrets, no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven, and he's 5
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be 6
You do the arithmetic
Me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart
And take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Mama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got

And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go
Knowing the whole summer that's all you could think about
Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up
You need a jump, like your need and your want to grow
And you change all the time
So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer
The next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more
You wanted something bigger and better

So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?

Right...right, so now you want a Cadillac...

I hope that you're the one
If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do thangs I know you like

I think I'm in love again

Today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do something outta the ordinary
Like catch a matinee

If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now

Let's go to the movies
Come here

Girl, right now I wanna say, I wanna say
I wanna say stank you very much
For picking me up
And bringing me back to this world
I can't, I'm not
I can't afford to not record
I thank I wanna say
I thank I wanna say stank you, stank you
Smelly much!
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world
Hey, hey John! Are we recording our ad libs?
Really?? Were we recording just then?
Let me hear that, that first one
When I first started

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low ho

Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
Out my mind, ooooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baby
Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!

Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around, then I can't be found
Always asking "Gimme some," living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

Don't spend all your time trying to get high, nigga
That's why

Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out, 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, getting paid, fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
'Cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops; fuck Elgin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow

Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin' a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up. I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass

Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

It's beginning to look a lot like, what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know
Let's go

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um...

It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one..

Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

"Baby, did you hear that?" "Yeah, baby, I heard it too"
Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the funk is going on
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done

"Who said good folks is not supposed to die?"

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making my way on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? "Yeah, yeah, she chillin'"
We should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

All's well, nothing's well

What's wrong? What are you afraid of?
The Love Below?

She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
But she lives in my lap

She lives in my lap
Forever my fiancée
Don't leave, don't stay
I'll get the courage one day

Make me want you, make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are, then forget you
Girl, remind me, just who we are
We're oh so close, but yet so far

Baby, why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them...
I care about you!
Baby, I love you!

Play baby play...

You've got me open wide
Oh, she lives in my lap
It's yours
I'm yours
Play baby play

"Okay, here we go..."
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah!

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dying 'cause he thought could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world...

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stone, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

I came into this world high as a bird
From second hand cocaine powder
I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but its in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down, cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard
While we ranting and raving bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at

Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, in you,in you

I'm fascinated by the way yo
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me, freaky you
Can't help but be aroused
'Scuse me, Lord lustful thinking
But that's the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods
And laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be
Exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on
Until we felt excited then, aaaah
Oh now its on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere
If you know what I'm talking bout
Now if too harsh then walk on out
And I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny
Because its devilish
Now see we dead wrong

People don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee
Moping around and wondering where she stay
Saw her last that she lay
Give it another day I say
But the lord he taketh away
Now give it back lawd
Cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store
Crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth
Before a nigga like daddy was born
But they be making it seem
That my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean
My lyrics ain't clean

To keep my faith in you, in you
To keep my faith in you,my faith in you, my faith in you
My faith in you,my faith in you,my faith in you,my faith in you
My faith..

And there's a ,there's a,there's a,there's a fine line
Too late to pray that I'm on it, yeah, yeah
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late, but baby I'm on it..
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see
That's Liberation and baby I want it..
Can't worry bout, what anotha nigga think
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it..

Let me hear it

How many times I, sit back and contemplate
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm tellin my story..
My relationship, with my folks is give and take
And I took so much, now give me my glory
Now have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left uppa to me, and my momma n'em told me
I said I have a choice to be who you wants to be

I'm so tired, it's been so long - struggling, hopelessly
Seven and forty days.. heyyy
Ohhhh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe
To make you believe, I'd give my life awayyyy
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my owwwwn
All on my owwwwn, weeeeeee..
We alive or we ain't livin, that's why I'm givin until it's gone
Cause I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone.. yeahhhheeeeee
If there's anything I can say, to help you find your way
Touch your soul, make it whole, the same for you and I..
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe
We could fly, but I can feel it in the wind
The beginning or the end
But people keep your head to the skyyyyy

Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off
Shake that load off.........

Folk in your face, you're a superstar
Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot, now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars, make a million mo'
First class broad treat you like a nigga po'
You wanna say "Wait!" but you're scared to ask
As your world starts spinning and it's moving fast
Tryin' to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds, then you go on home..

I must admit, they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine
From them whores, from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
They're from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to ho
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
So you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted, without infanticide
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals who babble
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethern happen
Just by rappin..
LIBERTAD..
LIBERTAD, LIBERTAD....

Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level—what are we doing?
Fooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon

Like memories of yesterday

"Ninety-six gonna be that year"...

I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata, so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts

Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way

Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Don't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'

Dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old

Like some eagles, people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches
'Cause you flauging; falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul

See all them leaves must fall down, growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old

Greetings, earthlings

From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Post slums

This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged Andre to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding
I say look boi, I ain't for that fuck shit; so fuck this
Let me explain "only child" style so you don't dis'
I grew up to myself not round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments

It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods, Coupes to the Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill
In this atmosphere this ain't no practice here
We cutting the fool now
I'm doing ya at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now
Don't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop

Yeah tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted
I'm dealing wit Queens in my castle ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the pro-jects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond at the exit with a sign saying "We'll rap for food"
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the windex
Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax
Error, bring the terror to your dome like P.E
Prone to finish this out cause this be a free-style

Now who them boyz that be having the crunk every occasion
This side niggas dustin, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop......

Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi
'Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see

My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em
Show 'em who's the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot–
–ten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ho
And knock 'em up off they feet like a Southern hustler supposed To do, I's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
'Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

Well, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming
That I'm glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride
Now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast
Southernplayalistic

Ah-ye-ye, yeah!
Rrah!

Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
But skew it on the barbie, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I be got, damn it, they done changed the rules"

The common denominator, the nigga numerator
Never know who the hater, niggas cater to your ego
I'm sorry, like Atari, who's the cousin to Coleco
Vision, caught a RICO, back on the street like Chico
DeBarge, he large and got a 'Lac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my Lord
One at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other, and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party, women jump for joy
But all the wild niggas scheming, they gon' jump the boy
For spittin' all that bourgeoise—"My watch, my car"
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far, rrah!

Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso
Grow hydro, then bag it up slow
Price that, longevity suggest make moves slow
Take time, grow eight, react nine, blow!
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo
Fly ride though, shit lookin wild dope
Then glide yo, flippin' the page, I go
Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow
Watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those
Glocks blows leave em baggy and collect spot grows
Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes
Let the chop' blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what?

Boi, I bust raps like D-boys bust gats, shit
We the type of people that don't bury the axe
Or the hatchet, everytime we see your link we snatch it
Ridin round our hood talkin' that dumb shit, your cabbage
Is cracked, like plumber's ass, and summer's grass
I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckas like y'all passin
Thinkin' you're light skinned, aight then, lil' boy why you frightened?
The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing
I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic
Because that Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic, right!
College Park, East Point and Decatur they got my back, so
We gon' keep on jammin and stabbin off in the track, ahh
Think it's time to bungee but buddy we will be back
And I'm fin' to put some D's on the 'Lac, know dat!

Hootie Hoo, follow the funk from the skunk
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
It goes on and on and on, like that
Going out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac
Ah suki, suki, all day, e'rr day, any day, every damn day
I be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp
I never even smoked a gram of crack, but yo I'm dope
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pookie cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claiming true
To East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club Nikki, Magic City and them Southern playas
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
One for the playas at the crib, drinking drinks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make

Hootie Hoo
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right

Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport
But ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, we macking 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did
*click* naw, it couldn't be me. Not me

Hootie Hoo,Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right

Well you know we getting blizzard
Cause we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope
But some of you niggas can't cope with it
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park
So God Almighty know, it's Outkast for the '94 era
You heard the player's call, we taking it to another level
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martell
And you may go to hell

Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is
It's that Southern sess in your chest that is
One mo' 'gain for my friend who don't take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you
Down like some vocals, you can quote those
Head, till I'm dead, yes it's down yo throatholes
Don't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit
But if you fall in this category, then youse a bitch

Hootie Hoo, Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right

My name is Cupid Valentino, the modern day Cupid
And I just want to say one thing

Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
I don't think y'all heard me!
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day!
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see
He shoots straight for your heart
And he won't miss you!
But that's alright y'all won't believe in me anyway

Ya won't believe in me, but you would fancy
Leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you, Easter Bunny
Love will rule supreme)

When Cupid knocks at your door
You can't ignore me!
There's no need to run
Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what loves mean, well
Well, somebody tell me!
'Cuz they just don't believe in me!

Cupid will not be defeated!)

Now I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now I understand cause I use to be a bad boy in my day
I know you're trying to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away!
Ho, oh

Ya' won't believe in me, but you would fancy
Bunny!

Well keep on running player
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you going to find out tonight!

Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrela'
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella'
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, "Of course!"
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet so may the force be with you
And I'll hit you when better time permits
For now show me samples, examples of why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

Happy Valentine's

Fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day

Everybody's got opinions
On the way you're living, oooh
But, see, they can't fill your shoes
Life is made of half illusion, evolution
Forty percent confusion, oooh
Whatever's left I'm using to keep myself from losing, yeah
You don't know what I've been through, oooh
Hell, I might go through you
Ghetto boy that won't eat tonight
Uh-oh, oh-no-oahohh
That little boy just wanna eat tonight, hey, hey, hey, hey
He scuffles with her booty and her face
And mm-mmmmmm
Mom I'm seekin that Sir Tea and some soup, yeah
All in all, it's all in my head

You know it's that high guy, from East P.I
Spittin the realness of reality, you mad at me
Boi how you gonna handle me?
You want me to lolligag and talk that bullshit?
I refuse to play so I'm gon' speak that Southern good shit
That harder than yo' hood shit, lil' shit
That make y'all niggas think about the trigger
Before you pull it, on liquor stores and banks
Them folks got more than enough bullets to put that ass
Off in the slang, don't claim no gang, we the niggas
That did that "Ain't No Thang But a Chicken Wang"
But still though, how you gonna play a nigga like dildo
We OutKast til it's over, barbecue and never mildew
For real bro

Has the computer age, scientists, and doctors gone too far?
Einstein or Frankenstein?
Dr. Scholl's, or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?
Are we digging into new ground
Or digging our own graves? Story at 11"

Conceived under the influence of toxic wasted doctors
Computer buggin debuggin device-a and vice versa
And various viruses
Performing with laser light precision and verbal incision
For a lingustic ballistic lobotomy
Mind-fuckin you, a psycho-sodomy
Of the medula oblongata
Exit your mind down your spine and out your behind
Fuck you

Synthesizer, microwave me
Give me a drug so I can make seven babies
Pump my breasts up, can you suck the fat up
Please make my life appear
Like ain't no such thing as bad luck
My nose ain't right, think I need a new one
Just take your pick, a yellow, red, a black, or a blue one
Virtual reality? Virtual bullshit!
Synthesizer preachers can reach you up in the pulpit
Who a bitch?
Give me my gat so I can smoke this nigga
Tell his mamma not to cry
Because they can clone him quicker
Than it took his daddy to make him
Niggas bitin verbatim
Thought provokin' records radio never played dem
Instant, quick grits, new, improved
Hurry hurry, rush rush, world on the move
Marijuana illegal but cigarettes cool
I might LOOK kinda funny but I ain't no fool
Now if you wanna synthesize I emp-athize
But if you synthesize I will understand
You'll synthesize a man

Ghetto boy horny tonight
SCSI with a booty in a cage
Problem sinkin down and stretchin out
Digital good time, digital good time
Said she'd lapdance on your laptop
While your laptop's in your lap
Cybersexy Wendy web walkin in the nude
Fuzzy logic, it's groovy..

Wassup, man?
Wassup player, wassup, wassup? What'chu need? What'chu need?
Shit, trying to smoke good like you
Shit, I ain't smoking good, I'm just out here trying to pay these bills, my nigga
What it look like for the Oskie-Wowskie?
Shit, for you? Cause you my nigga, shit, 65
Yup, yeah
You don' charged me 50 the other day
It's some of that goddamn LA, some of that west coast
So it must've had a fifteen-dollar plane ticket added on to the motherfucker
Aye, shit, aye, I don't put the tag on it, my nigga, I just sell to you just the way I get it, know what I'm saying?
Still the seeds and everything, huh?
Shit, you know how it go, playa
Well, I'mma tell it like this, I can't even smoke like that so you can go on and keep that
Shit, I holla at you later then
I'll holler at you to then, don't holly at me no more
Shit, holla at you
Bye, nigga

Woo...woo
Yosky wosky, peesky weesky
Whatcha wanna do-ski?
Nathaniel
Niggas get Jacked like Daniel
Something I can't handle
Yo...unkay...

Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoos don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordia-lly
Invite you to an emotion filled theater
Bring your umbrella cause young fella it gets no weirder

We reign, reign, supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

Just hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah my Lord

To make one bob they head would be the track job
Your job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted, I won't comply
With that slackin', poppin' and crackin' Fourth Ward say we snappin'
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happenin', see if do what yo won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin', when I see you nigga you packin'
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car doe
But still stay with mom though, playing the King like Don doe
You choked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be so loced up
Makin' them think Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg yeah

And the winner is...ladies, help me out...OUTKAST! *crowd erupts*
Goodie Mob in the house

Yeah, word; what's up? Goodie Mob in the house, yanamsayin'
We wanna say what's up to New York, yanamsayin'
'Cause we from Down South, namsayin'
Is New York up in this, yanamsayin'? Are y'all in here, yanamsayin'?
This y'all city, yanamsayin'
We just wanna say—yanamsayin'—wanna say what's up to all the original MCs out there, people like that who got their own stuff
So what's up, Dré?

Yeah, first of all, yanamsayin', I wanna thank God
Just—namsayin'—dead serious
'Cause if it wasn't for Him, yanamsayin', we wouldn't be here
But it's like this tho—I'm tired of folks, yanamsayin'
Them closed-minded folks, yanamsayin'
It's like we got a demo tape and don't nobody wanna hear it
But it's like this, the South got somethin' to say
That's all I got to say...

Mahogany Team Queens up on the rise
Be careful, watch your back, blackbirds don't wear disguise
How we comin, comin hard.. camels too slow
The game is hot you could never be a winner
Just begun a game so considered a beginner
Masada for real, this shorty here is here to stay
Mahogany go platinum after that we just parlay
I'm from the Bricks we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks
Fuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nicks
This life is plus I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want
Italiano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?
Can't be a joke I've been through too many games
Niggas laugh, but my expression wasn't hardly the same
Show me respect cause it's due, you keep the fear
Cause I'll get over and believe I'll come back at you

Mamacita, papadonna

Yo, now, you and your nigga shit shaky
And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
Lump in your throat, feel like a trachea, oh dummy
The pain that's in your chest done made it's way
Down to your tummy, you wide open, you start smokin wit ya girl
She nigga bashin sayin you don't need em in your world
Niggas all dogs? If niggas all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and her done got to drankin
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drunk
And your girl done got to thinkin
She talkin bout, "Girl you look so beautiful"
You say thank you bein nice you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do -- you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, "Bitch don't ever disrespect me never not at all"
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause
Them black ball laws of balance at all cost

Que pasa, que pasa? Check this out
Quiet nights like this, might twist one for the mota
On the balcony, I got a sofa
Nights like this is perfect, for this Spanish Fly
Can you come over, somethin, I wanna show ya
Told ya once we was gon' take a trip, touch you
With my lips where you like it, it's time, don't fight it
Piggy-back ride to the sofa, in the microwave
I got your favorite Stouffer's, lasagna, that's how much
I want ya, fuck flowers
The ceremony starts from the shower with the water
I got somebody's daughter in the Doctor headquarters, chillin
Prepare for this sex drillin, she said somethin in Spanish
Got me feelin mannish, me and you fin' ta vanish
Real quick, feel this shit, got cheese, tryin to make cheese
To get you pregnant overseas
Maybe make sho' that's my seed
Quiet nights like this, bachelor like me is single
Talkin to you Miss Bilingual
Let's mingle in the crowd, watch them show, pop some Moet
Tryin to get you so wet, never been to Spain
Never been a lame, horny, ever since I been a tiny
Fuckin with niggas with ageless bodies
Talkin to me, while I squeeze it bare
Let me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair

Friday night boi, breakin the old school out, boi we cruisin
Bout fo' niggas and fo' hoes, it ain't gon be nobody losin
But they choosin
Better get in where you fit in cause it's crucial
I'm tryin to cut bout two of them girls
Cause that just what I'm used to
I mean that
The first that look my way just gon' get splack packed
From the front to the back this cognac got my throat burnin like burlap
Everybody cheesin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like Pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew
Like Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus
The easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie
She thought we was some motherfuckin genies
So I checked her, like the king I am, no disrespect intended
Told her, and her silly friends
"Get out" before they got offended
To the Laquinta we went, layin them hoes down
On the freestyle tip, geyeah!

Permecito, senorita, mamacita
Mira mira, what's your name? Maria
Same as mi tia, de Colombia
I don't, in Atlanta, Georgia
And you don't think I got nuttin for ya?
You must be crazy
I'm out here tryin to feed my baby
Lil Bre, can't you see? Sheeyit
Do it one more time, sheeyit

Niggas in the point ain't changed
Yeah...

Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre
Can yo' punk ass come out to play?
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with, you's better off
Dead is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw, I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away
This ain't gon' work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Step up, nigga, if you want some

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane

Well, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, coming through your stereo

3-5-7 to your forehead
There'll be mo' dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me
Off my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollering ghetto
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep?
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy?
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is in the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just to let you know, yeah

It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this, a heater
Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See, I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?
You 'posed to be the quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets, letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
Yeah, that's how I do
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

Yeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas
Around the East Point way
College Park is really on the map
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped
With the motherfucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks
The heaters, the gats, nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop

Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

And I'm a star
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
What would you write if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra
I'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know and did you know
I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm
Ain't let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
And make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn
Like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze
Defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne, don't make me none
So that's why I got a pre-nup
I do

Yeah, Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention, I'm
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourths of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees
'Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird

Tenth grade, the way was pave for me and Dre to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein the arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new 'Kast
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting

I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share take you there
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang

Yeah, I’m back off in this bitch one more time
To drop this rhyme, about where my roots at
Yeah, Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah, GA is in the house, so check it…

February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'
Around Frazier Home, down in the Westside projects
Changin' over foodstamps, and hittin' a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm moving in slow motion, boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rolling reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch

See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearing furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that "tic tic" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string
'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, main
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga 'round me playing married, or paying child support
I can't cope, never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids
Woe woe, the world is moving fast and I'm losing my balance
Now time to dig, low low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up
You with me say shit, sho sho
Now let me ask y'all this

It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time
On a first offense drug bust, fuck the Holice
That's if ya racist or ya crooked
Arrest me for this dope I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it
Look at me, I'm outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me sir
Don't make me call L.A. he'll have ya walking sir
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage we scream
Don't everybody, everybody

Officer of the most high
You touch me you touch the apple of this eye
If they kick us out, where will we go?
Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as their kin folk
Still eatin' pork
Abomination desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on Judgement Day
Hip Hip Hooray!
Mr. Reaper Babylon the great
The mother of harlots is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled
The lake of fire is calling

As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
I finna enhance your brain, check it out

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store
Caught a nigga slipping, but now I lay it to the flo'
Just like carpet, 'cause I got the heat in my baby
Momma name now, never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson;
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute to your clandestine
Activity, my soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies
Yeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb
'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Drop, like tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers
And peoples who feel it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine

Okay, like this, yes, yes
One time for my boys doing King shit
Two times, too legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop

Touched by the wheelz of steel...

Ah, I stank I can, I stank I can
The funky engine that could
Ooh, ooh, yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky
All aboard the Stankonia Express
The underground smell road
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose
What's your locomotive, the Chatta-nigga choo choo?

Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard
I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting cause it's heated in the kitchen
Sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
From Isaiah, lay a, nigga down and spray 'em
If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em

Yeah, too Democratic, Republic fuck it
We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dolla, and wipe my ass with it
You living for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her draws
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol
I said "Oh hell naw!", but yet it's that too
You can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision
Do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes everyday, so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

I'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then one day, it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays, until the rain and sun
Then I breathe
Just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow just like a baby blossoming
And it's beautiful
That's life, that's life

So I guess I've gotta re-route my dreams
Y'all can't harm me, it's over

Every boy and girl, woman and man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Muthafuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate...vibrate higher!

Sometimes when it's late at night
And you have no one to talk to
Here's what you don', you go through that
Raggedy cell phone 'bout two or three times
Tracy ain't home, Tina ain't home
The Love Below start talkin' to ya

The circumcision has already begun
Desensitizing the very thing or thang that brought
You into this motherfucker in the first place
And when I say "motherfucker" I do mean "motherfucker"
Because Mother Earth is dying and we continue to fuck her to death
Play with your own score sheet, become the master of your own bation
And yes, God is watching you, but no need to be embarrassed
For the future is in your hands, no the future is in your hand
Play with your own score sheet

Whoo, turn me up, don't turn me down
Cut me up, don't let me down, find, find a way

Find a way to get out, without, a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out without a doubt

Climbing out this hole, with a frown on my face
In the place to be, and not to be at the same time

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish grandma could see us

I just want you to know, how I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?)

Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
As my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer
Leave a muthafucka open like a foyer
He from the dirty, now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect, the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this
Planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame
You've obtained, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out 'cause the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy, 'cause if it's not, we gotta fight like...

Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a change I don't feel but I see
Visions from me at 23
Making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it 'til I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to Cascade
I know it's through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing
Fatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes it's just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

They swan diving
Fit they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost, dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?
Be rhyming "catch of the day" when the recipe calls for "blackened"
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

I let you stay in my crib, now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal
Look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test, the potency
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
Deceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say
"I wish I never did what I did", now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
Got you niggas where they want you again
That's why, that's why, that's why

Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head
Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique, bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darling you make me lose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where I had to give your mama call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
For all its worth, girl what's your frequency
And can I come there frequently

Lucius Left Foot
What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant
And once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
Maybe Lady Luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky
Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill cause it's banging
And I like them red hot Fila straight from Walters off the chain
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you
Cause you push a big black Buick, so fresh, so clean on them Trues
Slum beautiful you's the would to me, shawty I dig ya
And I'm loving the way them Jordache got a bear hug on your figure
You my nigga, nigga

Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you
You're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do
The very thought of has got me running at the speed of love
Exploring everything about you from the ground to the God above
Suddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast
I could almost taste outer space
I saw the face of God and looked like you and me too
Hello, I'm the man that God made you for
Profound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion
Forever's gonna be so fun

I don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed
Or was it a pack of Now & Laters cause you're the sweetest thing on my head
And I'd like to say that I'd love to make love to every molecule of you
And if you want to spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison

Ye-yeah
East point in the house like this here

From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails down to the toes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes

Don't lie you love them
If you don't you like them hoes a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin', turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes, be dumpin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your 'fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'

To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

Ay, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente
She walk wit a fly Sashay
You love the way the leather grippin' your butt
Conversation kill 'em, drippin' em up
Relax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts
Whippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax
I stay G sharp as a note of music
Call me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it
I'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan
I slow it down, she like it - speed it up
She poked it out, I beat it up like that
Hit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary

Yeah, yeah, Gipp keep it double loco
Met up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry
Conversation hasty cause I was ready to dip
Sweatsuit velour so I ordered Kahlua
Fell in, hit her with the garden hose
Left her with the pokahose, got up and didn't say goodbye
Her face wrinkle up and froze
Why you leavin' so soon, supposed to
And ain't no question about that
They call me Big Gipp on the southside
Mr. Get Down in the veins so what's the word
Don't fall in love with good pussy off the top
Better leave for two months come back and pop, "study the shit"

Our shit don't mix like yay and lukewarm water
Better make it hotter splash ice and watch it rock up
I oughta duct tape your infant daughter
Show soldier ass niggas
I'm murder city's Sargeant Slaughter
Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker
The pussy wrecker and White Water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to never swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters
What's up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather
I've seen it all in the trap with fitted caps for cold weather
With creased denim threats delivered when I send 'em
Nigga know I, FedEx my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggas need to split
Quit fucking with this thorough Atlanta clique
This here is Slum Lordz we make your terrific shit tragic
My pen and pixel make violence more graphic
I take raw coke, cook it crack, saran wrap it
One muthafuckin' verse and already it's a classic
Killer Mike, nigga!

Don't you be looking at me crazy like you want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth

My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit' my feet up
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one like some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin'
Speakin', being, breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, cause you hate, you hate
It's too late, cause you hate
Punk pussy ass bitch, game over, who want some?!

Roll my blunts thick, like I like my bitch
Lick my blunts and spit, like she do my dick
Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus
Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might yell rape G, you might as well give her a throat baby
Goop goobler, goop gravy, no dicking her down to the ground
Now you doing the Dirty South, know what I'm talkin' about
Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches
Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'
That's just what's happening

A whey you want come dis
When you know you nuh fit
You better move you bombo
Before me start trip
Nuff a them a talk OutKast
Nuff a them a trip
Nuff a them come in like a bitch
Whey wear slip
A J-Sweet me name an' me already Chris
A OutKast me spar wid
So boy nuh try dis
If you dis boy shot knaw go miss
Gun shot a go teck you just like fits
Boy hear me song an' thought a remix
Brand new tune platinum hits
We nah gon' run and switch like no bitch
OutKast, J-Sweet, Killer Mike

Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacing back and forth
Inside I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say 'forget it'
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick...Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doing dirt
What am I s'posed do?

See, from bedknobs to broomsticks, we looking to start some new shit
I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your cranium with juices
See Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, "I'm proud of you people
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black"
Shit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we falling apart
You looking me in my eye, but you ain't feeling me in your heart
Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour
These niggas, they leaving me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marching, 'cause they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch

Planets and stars
Earth, Jupiter, Mars
Clothes, hoes, cars
It's who you are

Some of that uh, LTD Lincoln Town Car
Some of that El Dorado funk, know what I'm talking about
Gangsta Shit, you know, lay back, cool out, yeah
You know we keep it crunk around here, A-town style
Getting head on the highways yeah, but this what I wanna know

Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps

O-U-T-K-A-S-T, O-N-P, G-Double O-D-I-E, so fresh so clean
Back with Stankonia, Dungeon Family-ee
Pearl Cadillac on dics and vogues, flip flops, t-shirts and Dickies
It's the return of Billy Ocean, Cuervo is my drink
Stank, stank means you got the funkiest, dopest heat on the street
Three G ski, Slimm, Big Boi and this is C B-O-N-E
If you need some back-up, find your own
Ya girl gonna give you grief at home
Just tell her these hoes wanna be on the same team that she's laying on

Dope boys in the trap like to stack the dough
When beef come around can't let it go
When my funds turn legit I'ma let you know
Ridin rims real good down Old National
It's trappable, two bed, Jacuzzi bath, it's natural
Puttin cheese in ya stash, un-taxable futhermuckers get mad
Steady watching myself, got eyes in my back
Don't take no slack, when you managing the trap
If you work out, gotta get it right back
I trap by day boy, rap by night
C-Bone in this bitch, College Park trump tight

Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit

I'm pimp tight, give a fuck, niggas know what's up
It's T-Mo and Outkast in the back of my truck
We gotta simple little problem that we got to solve
It like it ain't about the money, we got to handle the job
No colors or rags, just guns and masks
We not scared to blast and dip off fast
With the Dungeon clique, just pulled a lick
Now what you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

Back on the scene, a sack of green sitting on chrome and rubber bands
Paint looking like Candyland, it's Slimm, the southpaw triggerman
Flippin' work and whippin' weight, rock up, roll and get the papes
Chop them hoes and then you skate, back to the block wit the deflate
Grams the O's, slabes to whole one's da flake
A young nigga holdin big face foldin'
Pimps are known for catching runaways
A good hustler's known to keep his gun away
First nigga run up and try to jack mine
First nigga fuck up to get flat-lined
Pack still stainless Coupe and Verts brainless
Y'all don't wanna fuck wit me, the trunk be  bangin
Off the chain danglin', y'all know that I'm from CP

Outkast wit a K, yeah them niggas are hard
Harder than a nigga trying to impress God
We'll pull your're whole deck, fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
Get full, and niggas, niggas
Pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
As if pitbulls went out of style, made a vow to myself
If it's for the wealth I'll stop, well put it like this
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer or fall
I dont stall, slow drag wit' your brain against the wall
Yeah, nigga naw, we lean to the side don't fall
All y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for? You're on that reefer and on that 2Pac
In front of them ooh-wops, trying to show out, that's the ho route
Talking loud talking bout that's gangsta shit

Yessuh, let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Poverty got me selling thangs, guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up
But still André got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine, thinking that you gots
Ample time to do this, have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less, bet' be ready
When they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest and
You's gone, up outta here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, wassup?

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me, I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but, shit, they missed me, huh
I'm getting nice with them thangs, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and, yes, my man, I'm true to dat
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses, diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters, count 'em, nigga, fuck a nine
See, I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys, kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayonara suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page
Ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets
Like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over

Wooo! Big Boi
Got a Tampa Nugget blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping
It's simply marvelous, time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit to take another hit, so hit it
Of the cannabis sativa weed reefer, yeah, smoke shit
It's all day e'ery day 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world, peace

We is gonna smoke out until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards I be buryin'
Coming around my shop with that, see, nigga, you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting, I be having your posse ducking
Nothing but King Shit, I am asking, sucka, can you hang?
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle sprinkle, motherfucker, don't be crying on me
That southern cess be in my chest until I'm chillin' in peace, yeah

Ah, shit now
Coming in like two fat hoes sitting off on Corn Flakes
Dropping these things like French fries in hot grease
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast
The J-O-I, just to let y'all niggas know
Forever pimping, never slipping, that's how it is
That how it's gon' be, that's how it was in the past
That's how it's gon' be in the futures, nigga
It's all day everyday, so what you wanna do with it?
Bring that shit on, know what I'm saying? Yeah

Drowning in the gray cell
To dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell
One-two! Sir Lucious L. Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth!
Lucious! Sir Lucious!
Sir Lucious Left Foot, has just entered

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked

Never let 'em be a threat
And your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum
Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell
You thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place, family members at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run

Once upon a rhyme one time when I was a child
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce!

1979, Dirty South, local lounge
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams
No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the game plan 'cause we got that hot sauce

Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a ho, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
To succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared

If you scared, say you scared

Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out

Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
At age fifteen they start smokin' Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it

February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all though bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin' like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me

Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine
I go off like mines, blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin' men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin' up shop, we already established
You lap doggin', we boss hoggin
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin', high heels clickin'
Paper champions, leavin' with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckas, think I got they package
But they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*

The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo-B
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our power's in numbers
You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth
You scared, you scared, say you scared!

I am the wrong nigga to cross and the first nigga to jam
With the AK-cuatro siete over microphone in hand
Goddamn, Generation uno, Dungeon Fam
The lab is filled with potions of emotions out the ass
I laugh when you think that you have seen the last
But it's only the beginning, my nigga, don't be so fast
Pass gas, slow it down to a screeching halt
Impeach the President 'cause he don't think before he talk
Iraq, goddamn, now he gunning for Iran
North Korea got that shit that make LA look like Japan
Our land, nah man, more like the Caribbean
Billy Ocean bodies floating, take a voyage to Atlantis

Selling glass and blasting, machinery sling past
Glow my ass off, po-po, they try to harass
My dough, ching cash, and I sit in my dash and vent
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
Bird baths, love to stunt, we got birds with gats
Fly past, buy NASA, caught up with the cash
Why blast when you know we in your crib? Bypass
I mastered what? The treasurer of getting ass
Whip assing, red pipe and leather; slick nasty
Sassy, but at the same time raspy
Plug me a thug, your mother eating plaster

Styles will change, they say change is dang-erous
As a King standing on the terrace
While his partner pointing up at the riflemen
Coward shooter, never know when your life will end
Then live like there ain't no 'morrow
And if one come, then this the motto
Now I put message in bottle
You go to the nearest beach and open your car door
And walk to the place where the sea meets the land
Yeah, it's easier to run the street than walk in the sand
Hey, I'm talking, young man, as if chalk in my hand
I will take y'all little ass to school
It's cool when the kids call me Sunny, the hood calls me Stacks
The B's call me honey, Hollywood calls me back
Crack and I have a lot in common
We both come up in the 80's and we keep that bass pumping
That's a nega-tive comparison, embarrassing
Unfortunate that if you come up fortunate the streets consider you lame
Ha, I thought the name of the game was to have a better life
I guess it ain't, what a shame
I don't slang, never slung, but I'm one with the slum
That has a name well fitting, plenty cheese getting
No wonder why they call it the trap, so watch your tail
And I'm not kidding, the rats and mice will give advice
They say, "You can paint and draw, get out of here
Go show them that we're more than slanging raw"
That's when I broke into my Big Rube impression
And I tried to enlighten but that night I learned a lesson
That the morals that you think you got, go out the window
When all the other kids are fresh and they got new Nintendo Wiis
And your child is down on her knees praying hard up to God
For a Whopper with cheese
Do you B), hit the street hard with a flair?
Or do you A), go to school for heating and air?
Dare make an honest living or make a crooked killing
Or do a bit of both until you're holding on a million?
Brilliant, you got one foot in, one foot out
You put your left foot back in and then you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey 'til you turn your life around
That's what it's all about, 3000 out

I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long

I... I can't read minds, but I can read yours
I think she says that she wants to pour your..
Your... yourself all over me
What you think? I could be wrong, but pupils don't lie
You know, like electric chair
You committed a crime and I'm the victim

I've got an eye out for she that cries out passionately
We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally
I'm too young to be settling down
Quick to change my mind tomorrow
So now can I borrow your timid torso
More so than your soul, honest me gotta be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom
You're the prism, Shirley Chisholm
Was the first, let's rehearse making a baby
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Shake the clouds until there's no more wetness in them
Tell your homegirls that you will send them

Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain, so
Spread, spread for me
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too, so

The morning after...

Now Peter Piper picked a pepper, that was his downfall
I'm down with 'Dre 3000 cause he got my back y'all
Ball if you want to, but do it with some class G
Ask me, do OutKast got some flows so you can blast me
Nasty, niggas on the point they see you shining
Engineers in the studio see me rhyming
Don't get me wrong, got four albums; stay consisent
You got a bodyguard, I let my nigga tote the biscuit
Twist ya cap back, you got blood off on ya fur hat
Cap, cap, ya link snap, you slumped off in ya Cadillac
For what though, some diamonds and a Bentley what you dying for
Aight ho, I'mma bake my cheese and let my mic flow
Prioritize to live through
Tell these other niggas how you bought yo' kid some tennis shoes
Let these brothers know that your momma she got her house too
Let these niggas know that your sister wouldn't of..
Finished.. college.. without you
I doubt you, do that though, so do this here
And keep that bullshit out of our ear
You too near me to not hear me, too open to conceal me
The love for the music keepin Big Boi spittin real G

Cause they know where you live and they've seen what ya drive
And they say they gonna put one in your hel-met
Cause you brag 'bout that watch, and all them things that you got
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet

How can you measure a nigga by multiple figures he may got, got, got
Had he not purchased the newest Mercedes
That lose it's value soon as you drive that bitch off the lot, lot, lot
Would he still be the latest, most wanted, doggonit you want it
He got it-type nigga 'round the town, town, town
Had he not played it so flashy
Ashy when half of these niggas hurtin and workin
Would be he be found, found, found
With his dick shoved in something he got a lot of
Bill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face
Of peasants when he Microsoft'n in the place
You gettin on my nerves, well I'm gettin on your case
Consider your surroundings or you leave without a trace

I know you got the biggest bank roll and you ballin
Follow the heater because the leader he is haulin
Ass like Juan Valdez, I think he scared
Cause my nigga Khujo Goodie got that toolie to his head

Little did he know that, waitin in the closet
No matter what you call that, playboy sure got done
Done was the one who came in contact
With those with slow goals who prone to sell crack
On this megaphone, hey look world I'm on
You off, he floss hard cause he celebrate the fact

Nada de novo vem do sol
Tudo de novo vem do nosso senhor
A vida é uma continuação
O nosso senhor é que dá a nossa vida, ámen

You can be sure
Some go low to get high
You may hurt till you cry
Till it's summer, in the city

I call the crib they say "Breeze, you ain't know?"
I say "What?" "Big Time got popped in his Benzo!"
I said "Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm 'bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell 'em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin' 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry 'bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in...naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
'Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime
It's the 'great ho 'round up yo' money' time
I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry 'bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame
It won't be over til' that big girl from Decatur sang"
East Point police don't know a damn thang...)

Yeah, it won't be over, check this out
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin'
Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping
And sang

Took me a long time to get here
Long time man
I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

Sophistafunk, aristocats
Distinguished dogs, clean up your acts
Pull up your pants, ladies and gents
Please, act like you got some sense
You know what I really wanna know?
Where do all the good girls go
What clubs they hang in?

Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap...you deserve it all

The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?)

Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain
3000's always changing but you stay the same
When I feel washed up and inadequate
And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, you make me smile
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking
You won't let me drown and I'm grateful

Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play
You'll always be this lovely
Cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The ying to my yang, darlin'
You've got that thang and you know it
But yet you don't and that's what's so cool
You don't say too much, but when you do it's profound
In the street you hold your head high
At home you get low down for me
Hooo! You're the anchor that holds me down
Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums
To see what a lady looks like
So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight
If you spot one, good sir, treat her right
This is Benjamin Andre signing off
Thanks a million
Good luck and goodnight

Nigga, quit being so got damn selfish
Put it in ya pelvis
Let it work, gyrate, motivate

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And naaw I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul
And then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it out
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy
Whatcha mean dog, telling a playa like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking on you for fun
Join the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars
Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends you truly blew me
Bitch

Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cute short white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came

Yeah, Spaghetti Junction, yes, yes
Damn, yeah, check it out

Niggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain
When it starts to fall
Lookin' like Ms. Pac-Man, hammers and Vogues and cat-man
I'm speaking about these pros 'cause you know nothing bout that, man
The nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet
You thinkin' about the beatin', this my ends is never met, nigga
Black man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older; now we up against the ropes
Yeah, they kickin' niggas door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets
And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need
Talkin' about that Southern sess, nigga, you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin' up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin' but dead, nigga

Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce
To all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims
'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend
Y'all, yes, yes, uhh

The junkies around my way are always smokin' up on that crack
Livin' the life of pimps steadily makin' this paper stack
Niggas don't understand the master plan, crumble yo' herb, man
'Til they start kickin' the do' in, then we ready to blast them
So mayday, may Dré, knock 'em up off they ass boi
We struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those
People got we forgot they always gonna keep a plot
Right up they sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave
Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too
So gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know
Heaven is the only good life, so what you strivin' fo'?

Well, like flip-flops and football socks
A nigga be rockin' the mic like birthdays
Lil' Jon and Sercy, so are you worthy?
I'm callin' yo' ass a flawed pimp
Yappin' about this crew you run wit'
Bankhead bouncin' to that dumb shit
So what mo' can you come wit'?
Yeah, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in my adidas
So Run like D.M.C. is me and, no, don't got no heater
Well, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln
I got my heat up under my seat
Just in case these youngsters tryin' to take it
Pullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot
They come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five is when they figure the time is right
When you good and sleep; I couldn't sleep until I seen it
'Wit my own eyes, 'til they come over the hill—surprise

Have you heard the news today?
They say a little 14-year old little girl had a baby on the way
Too much for her little mind to bear
And that type of news to her Mama she cannot spare

Toilet Tisha, damn we miss you
Toilet Tisha is the issue
Damn we miss you, Toilet Tisha
Damn we miss you

Tisha? Tisha! Tisha, girl what you doing?
Oh my god, oh, Tisha, Tisha!
Ah, no! Tisha! Tisha!
Ah, no! Not my baby!
Ah, no! I love you, no!
Ah, good Lord, ah!

Don't go away
Don't you dare go away from me, girl—I can help you
Don't go away dont you dare leave me
Don't go away, away

Five thousand, one hundred ten days is a short period of time
A mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth
You see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages
You know what I'm talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, Just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, Mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality

ATLiens style on y'all ass

Young Hov' in the place to be

You got red dirt in your afro

Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block?
Didn't have to break a steerin column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call ya
Never judge a person or a book by it's covers
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself boi
.. are you black, white, asian?
Indonesian, or Borean - that's black and Korean
We on the same team if we breathin
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seein
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it cause they scared we gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power, the cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height
Because I might just snap on a fuck-ass nigga
Might clap a cap at a sucka-ass nigga
In the meantime, Daddy Fat Sax gon' chill out
He might just, pull out his pistol
And let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kent, you better be way harder
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
Ain't no uno, we a duo; deuce dos to a pair
A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levi's and toughskins, one minus one
Negative one minus negative one is nothin
Bustin d-boy raps and player poems
The 'Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd
And rock the crowd original material while you bore 'em
Your live show consists of everybody's shit but you're-uns

Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze
With her Eyes Wide Shut, before I asked to hit her gut
If you brunette, Legally Blonde I might respond
Take you to Swan Lake and beyond
Antwan raps on, raps on, clap off clap on
I switch the flow so quick you cannot fa-thom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
Rhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good but you sound like shit
And your team lookin shitty to death

My nigga Big Boi said, watch 'em as they gawk and they gander
You can follow or lead like Commander Picard
You can have "The Whole World"
Or be satisfied with the boulevard, overstand
This young player's rhyme
I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme
Focused on every word, and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed, got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mine - Aquemini's
Murderous monster move minds
Did it so hard that it oughta be a crime
When you see I'm comin holla one-time, holla one-time

Don't, you, like, to groove
In your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes
To run yo' tennis shoes
Don't, it, matter to you
That OutKast we got that slump for y'all
Keep that funk for y'all

When I'm in the mood I rock the S Dot tennis shoes
At the interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops
And I, fix it up like gin and juice when I'm them interviews
Dudes wanna know what he copped
And where you got that, and how could they buy that
Where the million dollar watch at, stop that!
Why that, why this, niggas wanna hijack the flyness
I'm on a whole 'nother plane
A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin
Understand what I'm sayin
Hov' and OutKast, whatchu think about that?
Really don't matter though what you niggas chatter though
Anybody get out of line then you trust
That the Mac'll go b-r-r-r-r-ap, got you killed for that alone
Back on the shit, back on the strip
Another hit I'm not gon' miss

Hello lord, it's me again
I just wanna make love to the whole globe
And all her girlfriends
Now don't that make ya mind move
Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit' a bomb
Nam-viet, Viet or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gon' win
Now won't that make us all fools, like class clowns
Praying Private Ryan comes 'round
Sound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second
Niggas in the street they want it, hurry
When niggas start biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Apparently not, that's why you get what you got
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Think I'm finna vom'?
You move it like you mean it, she'll cum
Prom night might excite a down right fight like
White blood cells to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day, play is no longer
The feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale

We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

Look at the way you look at me, I see it on your face
All your hate emanates, but you still hesitate
'Cause you want inside of my head, but don't know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that, I see the way you were
See the way you smirk
I'm catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck XXL—you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dré, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car—why you frozen?
Pop the tape in ignite the explosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed

With a one-two punch, B-Real and André drop they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains
No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
Got the public's ears fucked up, can't hear
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps
Lo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace, but then explode like booty traps

Do-do-do, do, do-do-do

Something's gotta give!
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin? Uhh
Herndon Homes, unh, Martel Homes, Carver Homes, Techwood
Martin Luther King, Bankhead

Under-cover, over the hills and through the woods I go
Like green lights, a Southern nigga that's comin' for your throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them Southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready for your lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-Cities High School, was pulling 'em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you laid down hella swoled up
Hootie Hoo slapped you boys across the cheek with Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell 'em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl, when you giving up them drawers, 'cause
I got a couple of niggas down the hall
That wanna hit it too, I'm not the type to be acting selfish
Set it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis
'Cause the postman rings twice...
Hey Mr. Postman...

Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines

Record companies act like pimps
Getting paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear, I tell it like it is so I'm like look here
Just willing to get what I deserve, my kids do have a mother
And a little house, with a dog in the backyard going "woof-woof"
Who knows what I must face when I leave this recording booth?
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's
Pro-jects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef, you won't believe
The shit that niggas attempt 'cause they got other mouths to feed
Besides they own

It's some hoes in this house, damn right
I'm thinking about the way you skull me, girls be
Sucking me dry like deserts Mojave, Gotti, hotties and honeydips
Liking the way you do me, screw me and make my money flip
Shaking that ass for daddy, putting this gas off in my Cadi-llac
Back, don't ever snap, packing the gats and pimping whores
Hors d'oeuvres, swerve, hit the curb because I'm reckless
Back in the days when I was broke I'd snatch your fucking necklace
You ol' pussy-ass nigga... yeah

Oh my god where are my panties?

Damn where

I don't
He gon think I'm a ho
Fuck that I liked it
I was drunk and it was my birthday anyway
Maybe I should just lay here and let him touch my booty

Mmmmm but he dont even know my name

I know she think that I just think she some kind of ho
I don't give a shit bout given it up on the first night

That just lettin' me know

She know what she want outta life

What a hell of a way to god damn wake up

Oh that shit was good oh maybe

She'd get me some breakfast she so goddamn sweet, sweet as she wanna be

Oh I just oh I wanna lay in her hair

Maybe I just roll over and lay on her booty yeah!

Nah no no no

But what if she
What if she, what if she, what if she's the one...

Peep what I say
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork
To put the Glock to work
And putting the body to standstills
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex - like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing -- no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit - we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T
Coming across ya T.V
Extraterrestrial - straight from ATL

Out of this world
Are you alien?

Right now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker
But to you I may appear to be your average Joe
But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing
Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring
Extraterrestrial, out of this world

In the zone like Keyser Söze
Always the Usual Suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And Southern pride, I'd be
Checking my fucking head
Scared, looking up in your face, boy, I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies in the P's, freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try
Never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo
Flows on like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street
Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never baking, rebuking Satan
We had you waiting
For the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're rhyming
LaFace Records, I think they got that perfect timing
To be doper than Saddam, believe the Nation of Islam
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffing that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
OJ, not guilty, that's how they found he

I felt the pressure like sun shining
While raining at the same time
I kept on rhyming
Not complaining
Storm braining cats and dogs
My catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your Daisy Dukes
I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Rosco P. Col' people
Who caboose my locomotive
But enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift's a motive
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop
You find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fucking guts go 'head and dap me
'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway
And then go home and pray for your ass later
'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailing on you traitors
Like that

Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double D-Y Fat Sacks
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Sharp than a tack what a nigga want murk?
And everybody wanna know whats really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
So on and so on
I can go o-on and o-on
And on, and on, and on
Hell yes!

Music makes the world go 'round
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me

Two dope boyz in the Cadillac still
'Kast wear the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that fire
Hot like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long, now ya got Cabbage Patch silky
Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps
Exotic, melodic melody, yep, we got it
Fuckin' for the funk of it and everybody want it

I'm tippin' my hat off to ya baby
'Cause you're so fine, blow my mind
I put in the time
Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by
Without sayin' 'Hi'
I'm so gone over you
Yes, it's true
Baby, do what you do

Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby

D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book let me look
You let me hit the stage, that's when I got my folks hooked like...

Deeper than deep dish, hammers and vogues
I got my gun on standby, like Coast Guards
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching plagues
Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggas on they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your muthafucking spine
No, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie
Me be, wondering when I'm gonna see the end
Andre Ben' slamming backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts
So you know that it's D.E.E.P

Well, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will
What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill
He will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway
Aiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way
So if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it
Cause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody
I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, so I'mma hurt you
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
It's just so simple when we get so D.E.E.P
Learn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like...

No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be trying to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm zooted, bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be having funds
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I gets a little backup
Please don't let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we equal
Whenever the fuck our record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that
Gonna take y'all deep, so go back

I'm getting deeper than that prostitutes vagina
And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggas try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy
And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L

Pretty pink, baby blue
So crawl baby
Crawl baby

Miss lady
You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs?
Same here, and actually I think that's funky
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun

You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You've got me talkin like a baby
You make me talk baby talk
She's so sophisticated
She makes me talk baby talk
Got me talkin like a baby
Like ga ga and goo goo
Oh momma
You're so sophisticated
Make me talk baby talk
You're so experienced
Teach me somethin new
You got me talkin like a baby

I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?

Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!
I let out a call to da wild

Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King Shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, serving the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo
But that's aight though, cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

Time is slipping, slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth

What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love
'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia

Hey yaaa... Ba-doo-baaaa-ba-doo-baaaaa

Baby, take off your cool
I wanna see you, I wanna see you
Baby, don't be so cool

I want to get to know you

Odee odee odee oooooo

You ain't a hater? Can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealing with ain't nutty but the study going to unveil
To whatever make money, now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat!
The damsel's in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they getting warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's OK but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right
But hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect is mandatory, end of the story, go fly a kite
Category, ain't got none, you know I'm right

Congratulations, I'm a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded nigga,  so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone filling out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
I'm firing on the spot, go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle I've been patiently waitin'
Now that's a virtue; 'cause pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin' yo' ass with words, fool
Slam yo' back to the curb, bruh, like sanitation worker
'Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go 'head recycle, repackage then put it back in my cabinet
Boy, that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around, I'm right after Martin Luther
No JR period, senior 'cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biological's intact
Talk bad about the fam, catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction
Rumpelstiltskin, you wack
Decipher words just like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me
Caine, I want you to go out there, kill them marks and come back, is you with me?
Mighty ighty ighty ighty ighty ighty O
The worse thing since crack cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobody's slow

Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, ‘cause she screwed a lot
My baby mama beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too"

We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now

Party but you cannot call it that ‘cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Talking ‘bout what we gonna be when we grow up
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong

Here we go…

Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch
Here we go again with this psychopath bitch
The neighbors will hear you, you misfit
Can't disagree with the bitch without this shit
The price we pay to fuck women
The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them
Stuck up, as soon as I pop up
But see me with the next, she wanna tear the fucking club up
Check her pants, a number confirming
Learned more and more, they're just shit to dump sperm in
And you know, probably get cussed if I backslap Miss
While she busy trying to justify who cheated first
"Rick what would I want
With this small chain wearin muh-fucka trying to front?"
I oughta cut her off, let another soothe me
But I don't know, ordinary bitch don't move me
I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bitty
But straight up, just be with the bitch out of pity
So although I know, pretty bitch shady
Here I go, trying to change a hoe into a lady
Knahmean?

You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
My castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you
I've cast my spell on millions, but I'm terrified of you
Baby I do this from the ceiling, but I'm terrified of you

I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened... Dracula's wedding

I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you
See my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you
I've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you
Done my thang across the stage, but yet I’m terrified of you

You know I'm terrified...
You know I'm terrified!
Shh! Here she comes!

Give me the chance to dance romance
Don't run, I'm not the sun
So much at stake... oh!
Bad choice of words
But I'm not the gun with silver bullets
And I can count, plus I make great peanut butter
And jelly sandwiches... Van Helsing

For richer or poorer...
Through sickness and in health...
'til Death do us part...'til DEATH do us part
You only live once...well, not in our case...
Cause we live forever

Man, have you ever really wondered
Like why are we here? What the meanin to all of this?

Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..

Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hold
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning
But—what about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr?

Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team
Wide receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying

Girl you know you cut up

Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah

Nasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido
I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I

Oh, lord, how can it be so hard?
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack
As we strut, skip the line through the glass window, glance
We look fine, right on time as we step in the place
The nursery's crunk, we've come to play

Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me
'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny
So raise your hands to the sky, 'cause we super fly

What can make a nigga wanna take another nigga life?
What can make a nigga wanna do another nigga wife?
Like a butter knife
What can make a nigga wanna get his body so high
That he can't go to sleep, don't wanna eat?
Pray to God that he don't do crack
What can make a nigga wanna cut a beauty queen raw
Feeling every drip drop she can generate imitate seesaws
What can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club?
Figure that he ought to maybe be a pimp simply cause he don't like love
What can make a nigga wanna ache, break all rules
In a book when it took a lot to get you hooked up to this volume?
What can make a nigga wanna lose all faith in
Anything that he can't feel through his chest wit' sensation?

Shit man
Nigga gotta go on and gyat damn
Get the shit straight when I god damn get out
Well shit
This what really goin down

Whassup my nigga another day the same shit
Punk-ass C.O.'s on a nigga dick
Got me up at three o'clock cookin eggs n' grits
I'm a G from C.P. I can't take the shit
Tryin to hold a nigga down in this country ass town
I'm used to smokin chronic movin pounds
They got a nigga on some "Sir, yessir, left right left"
Throw me in the hole if my ass outta step
They treat you like a motherfuckin slave
Dopefiends find Jesus, swear they saved
Niggas better get they game tight
Cause these crackers tryin to take a nigga life and they rights
I'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks
They swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books
I hear so many lies it make me sick
These niggas called ballers sellin dimes and nicks
I can't wait til the day they let me go
So I can eat some steak and shrimp
Grab a mic, and bust a flow
I'm Audi 5 nigga lights out
Hold it down on the streets until the day that I get out

I'm out man

Well it is I, the pimp playing nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

Oh heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when niggas slanging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking
Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

Everybody needs a glass of water today
To chase the hate away
You know you've got company comin over
So you scrub extra-hard
And everybody needs somebody to love
Before its too late
Its too laaaaaaateee oh
Dont nobody wanna grow old alone!

Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
And scratch their dandruff
And everybody need to quit actin hard and shit
Its too late

Love-hater

Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even goin say the motherfucking rest
But you know
It's Dungeon Family all day long baby
We finna break it off with some fresh new shit

This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I auctioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots, I'm givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's gon' drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Screw them, Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro crows
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Talk to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now I'm out wit me now

I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed, bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the streets mayne
I just tell it how I see it nigga, facts is facts
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete, Big Boi, beatin through your Speakerboxxx

Ludacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx, so here he is!
Get the fuck on the ground
Is just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe that we'll stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs
Still wild is my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
Denenen, A hundred thou, bitch! Diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle,the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think He's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, gangster, poet
We gon' spit it, we gon' show it to your ass
"You're a champion" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre"
I say "people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay"
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spittin it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quittin?
Fuck, nigga

* explicit version only appears on a promo 12"

Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe

When that nigga be thinkin' of cruisin, the Braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over with this herb off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed, under the arm rest, under the leather
And thinkin' of startin' ways to make my life a little bit better
Than the dope peddler
Never to pay no fucking taxes
Takin' a chunk up out of my checks and makin my rhymes just look like practice
Buying clothing, Range Roving with my folks
Don't speak about the Dirty South, my crew ain't bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow because they envy
They talkin' bout how they fucked my hoes and that they could have been me
You lookin' to be the butterfly
Without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right cause you gon' make it, I swear my nigga
Or collapse one
Fallin' a victim to your greed, boi
You're lookin' to be Big Willie, but you're still a seed, boi
The information in my skull be pokin', some of y'all on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence, they got y'all niggas breakin' boulders
For quick money

Strugglin's just a part of my day
Many obstacles have been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we here in the first place
They can't believe cause they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can't wait for nobody to come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life
And got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself
So quit procrastinating...

Who said good folks is not supposed to die
The same nigga that said niggas is not supposed to cry
United States giving out milk and cheese to pacify
I'm sure they got a cure for A.I.D.S., but yet it's classified
You wonder why I spit the truth and not to make no dough
To make a difference 'fore this motherfucker up and blow
In pieces
I could think of many reasons
Only when shit is going bad, you want to holla Jesus
Fuck a pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleedin'
From crawling
Got these niggas thinkin' they really ballin'
When they isn't
Don't take my word, there's niggas off in prison
That will tell you
That's locked up for long time and won't sell you no flex
So congregation, will you turn your text
To the book of OutKast, chapter two, verse one
The first one that feel me, jump up and make a joyful noise
You'se OutKasted, meaning, now you have a choice, like that

Hold up!
Oooh, oooh! Somebody done told you wrong!

Ok, I start out all alone
`Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm living it through this song
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died, therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a parrty? Not hardly; I'm trying to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s uss, I said uss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit, Smash and turned it timid
Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most, part you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign

K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
I think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact
Because he saw you and me argue, now the energy is coming back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CDs

Tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Wax, tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream

You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?Tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
Feel your spirits fly

Oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me
Unleash your sexual fantasies
It would be so nice
Ahh, relax your body next to me
As I sing this OutKast melody
On this funky ride
So just relax baby

Now baby, now the smoke is in the air
Martell and Coke has got me there
And we wonder why you're high?
Well baby umm, it's nothing but that
Sess in your chest that got you feeling kinda crazy
So let your spirits fly
Uhh and enjoy the ride
Oh yeah baby

It's not clear if the suspect caused it; it is clear he wielded

Yeah, now check it
From alligator belts to patty melts, I be that smoothest nigga
So how do you figure that Atlanta don't be pullin dem triggas?
The Southernplayalistic pimp is up in this bitch
Man, my folkers up on that track, complimentin' that wickedness
See one is for the money, two is for my niggas who jack
Niggas ain't takin' that shit no mo', they got big Benz and Cadillac
My gat is in my lap, so whatchu wanna be startin' now?
I'm pissin' up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave, that cracker was foul

Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin' your boy, so hey, why don't you get your own?
As long, as I got this legally
People see that we can be on top of things without causin' another nigga sorrow
I know it seems it ain't enough to go around
But keep on holdin' on like Goodie Mob 'cause it's a better day tomorrow
That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you
For your ride, fuck your pride, hide better be out your seat
Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed
Ask me, if that material shit is worth your life
I don't know about yours, but if so, you smoking pipes, right?

Either want a Benz or a Beamer

Deep in the Dungeon for these many months
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts
Had to cut it out like shears, but for years I used to burn 'em
Gettin deep off in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on the session 'cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that getting a Benz is out of the question
The world is yelling Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but
Gum and lint, to sum the shit, up, I'm broke
Nothin' but hope, so Big Boi, tell 'em what you toke

I'm travellin' up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk
And thinkin' of startin' the ways to get that motherfucker crunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin' and chokin' them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggas survive and the weak niggas they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stopped eatin' at pig stys
Be activatin that Lo-Jack 'cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campbellton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
'Cause it's like this

I got these thoughts, similar to the ones in Call of the Wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin' about a hundred miles
The world is FUCKED UP how these niggas be driving drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the car does not belong, I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin' spree, look at me, W-M-B backwards
Takin' you to the chop shop with these verses
Comin' around the projects make you sleep off in dem hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must resist
You'll be needin' a physical therapist, 'cause you can't fuck with this

While you sat down by the seashore thinkin' about some seashells
I was around the corner from Pleasant Hill thinkin' about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packing my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem, I'm just breaking the steering column
I spot him, in the middle of the MARTA parking lot
I'm hearin' a voice in the back of my head yellin "Andre stop!"
But do I stop, naw, I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin' down 'cause the folks wanna run up
BANG!!!

Some say Atlanta
Some say New York
Some say Paris France but, who knows
Where this flower, grows

Brothers on the block knowing
Sisters at the crib knowing
Preachers at the church knowing, but still get by
Teachers at the school knowing
Babies on the bottle knowing
Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high

Well, here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly like In Living Color's Wanda
Now, everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
Or fall victim, I will overcome
Any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort, so make it last
For the risk you took, trick, you shook your ass
For some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life
Your dignity the only sacrifice
Slim as your chances of being somebody's wife
They seeing ya butt booty naked every night
Ain't nothing right or wrong!

Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda, now she's out of a job
She would slob on a knob for a little less than a yard
A massage, you could drill her like a sarge
She would charge and rob, pick through your pockets
She got the trick's watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the nightstand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget, you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped, now I'm getting in your shit!)

Nah nah nah
That's part of the
That's, yeah
I got ya good that time, shawty

Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existance
We livin, breathin, soon we'll be teethin
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Darnell and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint
Reset

Good does not come without pain
Meaning, before it gets better, it's goin get worse
Like my homies on the sick side still dyin over turf
That don't belong ot urse
I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle
Yeah, come on, come on
Guess what, guess what
Time to reset this thang

Listen to me
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright
This day will be done right
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
You can handle if tomorrow never come, right
You'll get used to singin if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playin Go Fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting
Hmm?

Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do whats right tonight
Make love, not war

Tonight we'll make the prettiest song that no one will ever hear
No one will ever hear
No one will ever
These ain't the times to be alone cliche the end is near
Cliche the end is near
Cliche the end is
Quickly approaching while we carry on
No one is promised another day
Why can't the story end like fairytales often do
Before I let you leave I've got to say-ay-ay-ay

Hey playa, this Peaches
Coming back at you one mo' 'gain with a big whassup
Break out your black love, and your Boone's Farm
As I send it out one more time
For East Point, College Park, Decatur, and the SWATS
We got that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik for yo' trunk
And it's fat like hambone, and tight like gnat booty
So let me take you deep, straight to the point
Cause it ain't nothing but king shit, all day, everyday

Operating under the crooked American system too long
OutKast, pronounced outcast
Adjective meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society
But let's look deeper than that
Are you an OutKast?
If you understand and feel the basic principles and
Fundamental truths contained within this music, you probably are
If you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slamming Cadillac do's
You probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker
Or maybe just don't understand
An OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
His occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself, are you an OutKast?  I know I am
As a matter of fact, fuck being anything else
It's only so much time left in this crazy world
Wake up niggas and realize what's going on around you
Poisoning of the food and water
Tampering of cigarettes
Disease engineering control over your life
Take back your existence or die like a punk
This is Big Rube, sayin' right on to the real, and death to the fakers
Peace out

Live, from the center of the Earth
Seven light-years below sea level we go
Welcome to Stankonia, the place from which all funky things come
Would you like to come?

All that bouncing, niggas ain't from the A-Town
We got Bankhead right here, southwest Atlanta too strong

André 3000
A.k.a. Possum Aloysuis Jenkins
A.k.a. Dookie Blossum Gain the 3rd
Funk Crusader, Love Pusher
Dungeon Family 1st Generation
Here to drop the turd

Antoine Andre Patton Sr
Better known as Big Boi
A.k.a. Daddy Fat Sax
A.k.a. Lucious Leftfoot
A.k.a. Billy Ocean
A.k.a. Francis the Savannah Chitlin Pimp
Here to keep the "D" in D-Boi
And still cooler than a polar bear's toenails

Hold on, be strong
Hold on...

It's cold
No, it's cold
It ain't cool, it's cool
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool
It's me, I'm... cool

Bitch, stay off that blow!

Ghosts and goblins run amok
In the caverns of rhine
Slinging petty corruption
The seventh sign!

Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Bust...bust!

Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care!
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thunder, no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chuck E. Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer than soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flaw
Flaw means fucked up and serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide!
You scared?

I officially do it with duns on tour
We lock down traps, push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
I serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash
Usually keep a G-pack on the dash
Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes
My Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a 4-pound Baretta
I'll shoelace your face just to learn you better
My ox so sharp it cut through leather
My rap name Killer, my street name Skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!
I switch my slang spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast, my coast the South!!!

We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call

Now look here
I'm gon' hit da club man, I'm gon' get some love
I'm the coolest nigga ain't gon' spend more than a dub
I'm gon' tell that broad and her chicken head friend
No Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz
Might just play the wall with this mean look on my grill
Act like I'm da hater, the Haitian from Hateville
I remember her, act like she don't remember me
When I was Cadillac'n, Coupe Deville'in, and chickenhead drillin'

I'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid
Like some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid
Making a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
With no delay
And a, four piece grizzle we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay

Them boys so wild, don't crack no smile
Popped tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles I got something for 'em to swallow
Anybody ever told you you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow
They call me Mack Rapalicious, and when I bubble
I blow trouble up, in your ear
They call me Mack Rapalicicious, and when I bubble
It's, trouble all up in you dear!

Yes, I know the way excite them hoes
Me cold reptilian feet, bite them hoes
Got a partner, oh his mind sick
He say he loved this ol' coke-strung-out stripper bitch
Why he so dumb?
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Got tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous
Run with this pretty thang
She ain't yours you wish she was
We don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous
Mello Capone, Don Huggy Bear
Pokey the fuckin' pimpolous, ain't that cute slick em, out their draws I'm so infamous
Dead serious
From the club, to the Caddy, to the Holiday Inn
From the dusk til' the dawn we gon' do it again

Come in God
God, come in God
Damn you're a girl

Ok well
I guess the reason I'm talking to you tonight is
Cause I've been doing a lot of thinking and
And I consider myself a pretty cool guy
And I never cheated on any of my girlfriends
Well, except that one time in Japan
But that was just head and head don't count right
Thanks God I knew you'd understand
Well, I just feel like
Well to be honest with you
God I just need a sweet bitch

You know somebody not too, not too fast but not too slow
Cause I don't have it all to do it my damn self
And life ain't easy
You know I just want somebody by your side to help smooth
That thang out, you know what I'm talking about?
And at this point

I mean I'm not being picky
She don't even have to a big ol' ass you know
Just something...
Well proportioned to her body
You know a nice little tail you know

What? You say you, you say you found somebody?
Is she cute? So when do I get to met her?

Oh God, you're the greatest

Well, I guess I'll talk to you later Amen

Oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Alady

And now, Kim and Cookie

Ahhh, such sweet sound
The Fiddler on the Fuckin' Roof
Is that Mr. Bentley Fonzworth?

Indeed, it is, sir

Good day, good sir
How do you do? Look fine

Fantastically well
I am certainly not fine by far
But you could say
I'm close to spectacular

Close to spectacular? How so?

Open your eyes
Spectacular's right in front of you

Whatever you say... you're spectacular

No, I'm fantastically well

Come on, man, make up your mind
A minute ago, you said you were fine

No, I said I'm close to spectacular
But I'm meeting fine in a minute

Close to spectacular?
You said you were fantastically well

Exactly

Exactly? Which one are you?
Close to spectacular or fantastically well?

I am certainly and without a doubt fantastically well
And was close to spectacular but I must say, good sir
You just pissed spectacular off
And don't even mention exactly...
But here comes fine right now

Oh Lord, she is fine

Hello, well good evening, ladies and gentlemen
What we like to do right here—well first of all, let me let you know who I am
Well, I go by the name of André 3000, right?
And we come from a little place called like Stankonia, Georgia, right?
You know, right now everybody wants to be from space
And like want to be from the country and everything like that
You know, like, really, like, the South
It's like cool to be from the South right about now
Girls, listen up

Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn'
I don't know, I'm somewhere stuck in between-tween
I'm out here knowin' hip-hop is dead
The average nigga on my corner yellin'
"What the fuck you mean-mean?"
See, we ain't even seen the mountaintop
Counterclockwise goes the neighborhood
Hand-me-downs and canned goods
Won't cut the Grey Poupon
We got to make you run, back to the drawing board
Can't afford to lose, y'all make me yawn
And let me tell you like I heard it when I felt deserted
It wasn't no other way to word it, got my feelings murdered
By the bullet of bad, the singer of sad
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad
Plaid clash with polka dots, I hope you ain't mad
Back up, little mama, I'm about to react

Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah

People have ya party, but please don't be late
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate
Hey sexy mama, there's no time to waste
Grab your partner, roll around, and feel the sound, ah baby
People have ya party, and don't be late

While Scotty is beamin', lil' Pookie 'nem schemin'
What's the use of living, my nigga?
While you snoozing, I'm dreamin', I'm Tylenol PM
You amount to the same thing every day like per diem
Never tryin' to be nothing but a damn "What you're being"
One nation under the cool should be the rule
Whether young man or young lady begins or starts grade school
Silence before violence
Nine times out of ten times, the quietest is the livest
Fumblin' through your privates
Daddy Fat Sax, can they have your back? Naw!
Ooh! You're such a playa
Ooh! Your Southern drawl got me sprawled out
In your black book, my name was crossed out
Reminiscing, the party you was missing
Instead of arguments, you think about the hugs and kisses
If this is something hard for you to take
You better bounce, rock, roller-skate

Chronomentrophobia... The fear of clocks... The fear of time

High as the cost of living
I take what I've been given
Pastor say "be strong"
Ooh hey hey
I ain't got time leave me alone
I ain't got much time left
I've got to funk you now

Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

Lord be havin mercy on my soul
I'm havin the impression that my life gon be a bowl
Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope
Got tired of bein broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin in this racial war
Tryin to find solutions to the situation I'm facin
Only thing thats free is my flow that y'all be chasin
Lettin my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like droppin books lets stop the crooks
From robbin you of your brains and such usin welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be findin much
Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this
What we stood for "fuck that fame and that glitz"
It's beginnin to look a lot like the endin
And got to be more careful know what corners you be bendin
Revelations gettin impatient and now I'm dead
Remember what I said I'm gone bow ya heads

Cool, moving cool, moving cool...

Cool, moving cool...

Moving cool, moving cool, yeah...

Hey, hey!

I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way
But when I'm around, you don't have to much to say
La, la-la, la-la, whoo, whoo

You see there will always be someone, taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else

After party, after party, after party, after party

I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody see's what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy
Oh no, oh no!

Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad execuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America...
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite
Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous
Like a D-Boy movin' fifty P's of that work
From A-Town to Dallas movin' cool

Now get the fuck up off me nigga..

As I, struggle to keep my balance and composure
I'm 'posed ta, propose a toast to players on every coast-a
The lyrical roller coaster, mind-bender
'Stead of watchin these sucker MC's
I'm seein just how they lyin to the general population
Don't be patient, get up and stand up for your life
Don't you agree or understand we lost some rights at 1-1-9?
Come dumb, come young, come blind unwind confined
To the situation, we facin, cause in time, tick tick boom

Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom

When will we all, awake up out this dream
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings
Man actin as if he was the supreme bein
Clockin the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern day magicians
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health
Who makin us ill, they makin us kill
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nuttin all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!

Operation Anaconda - ask yourself
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got they answer for ransom
As we read together, as we dream together
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and SHOCKED you
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin
I'mma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen
Now eat nigga!

Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

People don't you worry bout me
Evil gon get buried by me
Well, I'm gonna shoot you out this lil town
Soon as I do it I'm gon get down
Come on, Come on

Mama dont you worry bout me
Papa dont you worry bout me
I live a life but it just ain't mine
Know I'm a your son won't you let me shine
Come on, come on

Sally don't you worry bout me
Don't worry bout me I'll be fine
Well that's what I tell 'em but I'm lying
Come on, all people come on

Yall know bout the blues don't you
Everybody get the blues
Even babies get the blues

Some call it baby blue
Some call it midnight blue
Whatever hue is what we gonna do
We gonna play until you feel happy
Till there ain't no more blues

Idlewild
Be there

Dear Andre...

"I hope this letter finds you in the best of health
As for myself I'm doing well
And P.S. with or without you, I can't get enough
That's why you're my favorite stuff."

All aboard
Or, are all y'all bored?
It's good to have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Y'all already know what it is

Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta
'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy, so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared, dog
Back in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Welcome to my life, I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with
Now on ATLiens, we was killing it
And then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die, I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's your birthday, even on your worst day
Live it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know 'bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite, that means I can't be hurt

Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
But I swear to you I'm a changed man)

And now it's time to say goodbye, they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
When your faith is in the right place, see, he ain't gon' let you flop

Before you can say you can't hit goal
Please, no excuse this time, don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go

Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger couple of kids in minivans
Standin in the stands like a fan watch her little man
Run ball... And everytime you see the family they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had her cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like

It was the night that they done dipped and all throughout the palace
That didn't do his part heartbroke or no more marriage
When it happens you'll be slappin yourself rememberin
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you sittin in the courthouse plaintiff and defendant
Pleadin to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin was splendid see she was grinnin and spendin
All of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn... fuckin around

Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around cause you know
That I'm tryna change but its hard cause I've been this way

You know, niggas worldwide...

Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs, nothing but them 'Lacs
I'm talking about a black man heaven here
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yeah

Limbo vibing good ‘cause love is in the air
To all you players and you pimps, smoke out and have a ball
And if your hoe is actin crazy, put her on the wall
Now now now everybody's dancing and just feeling right
I see all of you players got your sauce laid in more ice
I hope when all y'all of this is over, as I get old, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, woo, huh, about

All the players came, from far and wide
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening, all day e’ryday

A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain

The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now

I was scufflin' going to school
I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what
I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents
Single parents, don't tell me what God can't do
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child
You move on
And that's what I did
I moved on

At... at a young age

He always wanted to be a father
But he never took care of you
He ain't have no money
He ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them

Must be a drag

At a young age...
Must...

And I knew I had to go that road by myself

She's alive

*Sleigh Bells Ringing*
Man...the scene was so thick
Low riders, Seventy-seven Sevilles, El Dawgs
Nuttin but them 'llacs
All the players, all the hustlers...
I'm talking bout black man heaven heah, yknahmsayin? Yeah...

"It's beginnin to look a lot like" what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's bout ta go in depth
This is the way I creep my season here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no no it can't cease
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet!
I said subtract so shut up that, nonsense about some "Silent Sight"...
I gots in crunk if it ain't real ain't right
Forever chill with Smith, I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson'
Got my reasons, so tell me what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all Deck the Halls?
Oh naw, I got other means of celebratin
I'm gettin blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waitin
I made it through another year cain't ask fo' nothin much mo'
It's OutKast for the boots I thought you knew so now you know

All the players came.. from far and wide
Wearin afros and braids, kickin them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya.. there's a better day
When the player's ball is happenin, on Christmas Day

Y'know I do some things mo' different than I...used ta
Cause I'm a player, doin what the players do
The package sto' was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm gettin serious, I'm gettin curious
Cause the house is smellin stank the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbin folk niggas in the back
Gettin tipsy off the nog'gen, high as hell off the contact smoke
They passin herb rewindin verses cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hittin switches
Cause I'm switchin from side ta side lookin for ho snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway my pager broke my vibe
Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
Cause it's like that, heh, yeah

Ain't no chiminies in the ghetto so I won't be hangin my socks on no chimneys
I'm full as a tick, fix me a plate
Just to let you niggas know in ninety-three that's how we comin
So 'Ho Ho Hoes', check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so umm..

The corner in my Cadillac, my heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back my elbows out the window
Coke, Rum, and Indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to underground, see's a lot of hoes around
I split my game while waitin countdown
A five fo' a three two here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk spark another one..

Here's a little somethin for the players out there hustlin
Gettin down for theirs
From East Pointe, College Park, Decatur, Devry
You know, niggas world wide
Down, for theirs..

Hi-errr, this is the Captain ... speaking
We are now descending into Hartsfield International Airport
I'd like to welcome you to Atlanta
We have clear blue skies over Atlanta
Which, by the way, is the home of the Atlanta Hawks, the Braves, and the Falcons
To the far left, you can see the Georgia Dome
Which by the way still flies the Confederate battle flag

Atlanta has been called the new Motown of the South
And is the home of LaFace Records
Organized Noize Productions

If you look to your far right, you can see Decatur
And below you, to the right, is East Point and College Park
Home of the red dogs, rap cats, and robbin' crew
And home to the player, the 'Lacs, and the motherfuckin' Outkast

Zora and Rooster under peachtree
They K-I-SS-I-N-G
Wow first came he love
Now then comes the marriage
1-1-1 baby 2 baby 3 baby carriage baby

Welcome to my world oceans vs. mountains
Call me the poor girl cause I love to fight them
I'm quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around
Like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love but
Not that type of guy

Oohwee you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walking and the world's the wire
Remember kissin on Broadway you die
I was bein your baby and tickin your tock and yo clock
And I was dreamin bout children Emily and
Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go and
Change it all you turned my spring to fall
I needed you you know
But when the love is gone it's time to go

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up til 3 o'clock in the morning
While you party up til the dawning
Darlin' ain't no feelin left it's just the killin
Oh... just grab my gun and lets go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin
Got me reelin
Call the law and hold the applause

Oh baby its mo baby its workin on the 6
We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like "boohoo" then "boo" "fuck you" and "fuck you too"
It appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too and plus yo plate
But wait now.. Don't you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours now it's all yours
Thats hard... It's all yours... Good God!

I don't know what to tell ya)

In the eye of the storm
Looking out through the rain
Gabriel, blow your horn
They shield me from tsunamis and the hurricane

Gangsta ride right in the nick of time
Soul is 'Delfonic' then they'll blow your mind
Bold ass soldiers marching out for war
No idea what we in for
Powerful magnificent and so divine
Soul is 'Delfonic' it'll blow your mind

Hear a thunderous voice
Shouting there will be no peace
Until our people rejoice
When every boy and girl is freed
You see it's going down
The war and the mysteries
But my friends they'll be better days
And a better way
According to the prophecy

To hook up in paradise
By all means we must go
Or are you in the know
Like all the way up sunshine

You been a friend of mine

One for the money yes uhh two for the show
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin ta find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin
Writing rhymes tryin ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin the crowd move but we not makin no G's
And that's a no no

Yeah, uhh, check it
Ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggas
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin
Niggas say motherfuck that playin, they payin
We stay in layin vo-cals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea dem niggas they makin big noise
Ninety-six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
...around this bitch

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin down the strip on vogues
Comin up slammin Cadillac doors

Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
Off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smokin them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
Passes gettin thrown like Hail Mary's and they lookin like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin wine
We's just chillin, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
Where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin dick, now
We movin on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone

Heard a call from the other way
That I just came from, some nigga was sayin somethin
Talkin bout "Hey man, you remember me from school?" smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown
Facial expression lookin silly
And he kept askin me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue

Cruisin' in the ATL

Uh-huh
Well, all right
How y'all doing?
Yes, ma'am
Looking mighty fine

I've been around the world
Seen so many pretty girls
But I still get overwhelmed
When I look in your eyes

Been from Maine to Spain
But everything seems the same
I only feel the change

I know you're upper-class
I know you've got pizzazz
Every man wanna kiss yo'...
And I do too

Sometimes I'm just a clown
And everybody puts me down
I guess I'll come around

Tell me what's a man to do
To get close to you
I'm just a lonely fool

Don't tell me no this time
If you do, it'll blow my mind
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
It's an awful thing

I guess it's time to say goodbye
But I gotta give it one more try
I'm only satisfied

Ooh, please come home with me
Ooh, don't you wanna marry me?
I'm even gonna rub your feet
When they stink

How can I let you down?
I guess I'm always gonna be around
I'm simply astounded

Is gonna appreciate that?
Stuff I like, okay?

Ain't noboodddyyy like my style, yeah
I light my fire, yeah
They blow it out, yeah
And don't nobooddyyy gonna feel like that, no
Monkeys on back crawl
Now watch them all fall
Gon' fall! Look out!

Nobody wanted to dance, when I had a lot of time on my hands
Now I gotta lot of hands on my time, and everybody wanna be a friend of mine
Whoa, whoa! I wouldn't mind a friend
The fellas back home all tryna win
Moon keeps shining on bootleg bottles
Cops in the street, keep yo' feet on the throttle
Sellin what you got, can't afford they model
Yellin, "Go DJ, go!"

Ain't no Idddllleee;everything is Wild, yeah
You can be here now, yeah
Be in the ground, yeah
And ain't no bibllleee at this here church, no
You won't find God, no
Might meet Him first, oh
Oh, God! Look out!

Nobody wanted to leave, house so packed that we couldn't even breathe
And ain't no better place to fall in love, angels sent from heaven above
Swing down! They gon' change ya life
You might make a baby, might meet ya wife
But one sure thing that you gonna say
Deep down south rustling in yo' place
Them Idlewild cats man they don't play
Don't make me send the telegram to Rooster, he'll shoot ya

You better come harder than that sweetie!
This ain't no mortuary!

And you don't wanna take it to the gat so soon
Stinkin to ya Jenkins, waiting in the upper room
Tell ya maker, say ya prayers, we some playas but you made us
Mashed potatoes, bad potato, blast you hater, blast the gator
So you might just wanna kick back and drink roots
Take hat to ya woman, relax, break loose
Cause pret' soon if she choose, she gon' walk away from you
Straight to the Rooster cause he's cock-a-doodle poo, what they do fool?
Who's tryna run a small time crap shooting
All time fat chewing, hats got the matching suit and lens
All cats pursuing, kinda wild, it's Idlewild
Time to break it on, break it on down now
Percival take it on out!

Say whoa Mammy!... whoa Mammy!
Say whoa Pappy!... whoa Pappy!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!

Now sittin' in the bathtub listening to the Isley
Brothers and others outside my door want to despise me
Reminds me that everyone ain't cool, the world is jealous
Never could understand when my mama use to tell us
"Don't take your food outside around your friends
Unless you got enough to feed the neighborhood"
The play has just began, follow me now
Act 1 Scene 2 the date 1/1/96 the time I don't know
Mood disturbed, Dre goes on to say they trying to get over
Like them niggas with the blinker on, I got my thinker on
So I'm like 'Word, however you want to act is fine'
That is real as fishing rods
I might be kissing God but I'm still in the battle
So if you got cattle you best be fasting
For 7 days and 7 nights we everlasting
20 years young on a quest to get my class ring
Just for them fhite wolks, I will if it's the last thing

Yeah, slick, knowhatI'msayin', I'm gonna tell you like this
Just 'cause I live the apartment don't mean you can keep puttin' these notes under my windshield, I'm tellin' you
Shorty gon' bust your ass about that shit

Check it, hey y'all, hey y'all, hey y'all, hoes
Back up in this bitch rippin' tracks like I'm supposed
Tommy and Ralph Lauren don't like niggas to wear they clothes
Where your proof at? Who's that? Talking shit like those
Keepin' the rumors up, I wish I lived in a fuckin' cave
I ride the streets in Lexus, all these crows they wanna be saved
Go to college, get a job 'cause all you want to do is shake
I use to hit Club Nikki's but I gave that shit a break
Just like Maaco, Waco, burn it to the ground
I bet you eatin' that pork when your partners ain't around
Backdraft, scenes of Shaft splackin' these hoes just like he's supposed to
Like pottery, sloppily, playin' hoes like lotteries
OutKast did the dirt and now you swear your shit is poppin' see
I'm living in the SWATS so you may call me Daddy Fat Sax
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'? Like this
Everlasting

One in a million men passing the J off in the culture
Don't y'all smoke a couple of pounds and get tore up y'all
And tear the devil headquarters down to the grizzound
Is how we hit the house and puff a couple of good pounds
Of good weed, PeeWee, my nigga Little Beewee
We need a 50 box of Phillies and some bouncin' titties
From the Magic, the Flame
Nikki's too, and share in Sequel's
Never payin' for no pussy
You can shake it, you can keep it to yourself, hoe

You left your morals at the door, when you stepped in, crept in
Naked as babies at the beach, so
Now you wonder why your nigga done bust you in the fore
Head, ain't no respect there, so now you just assed out like breech
Delivery, slivery got you swung on
These types of things go on from here to Bowen Home to London
England, Wall Street to y'all street
Sometimes I get bewildered and it throws a nigga like me off beat
But I'm back on it
Because we lasting 'ever, sound good, don't it?
Rattling your trunks like FAMU and the component
Said that's it—man, fuck that shit
On and on and on and I'm out

Hey, baby?
Yeah?
You know we've been together for a long time, right?
Well, I got one question to ask you
Yes?
Will you marry me?
Yes!
Good, but I got one mo' question
Will you sign a pre-numptual agreement?
What?

Ready to set this bitch off?
Alright, you got to step, you got to step, get close to the mic
Okay put the headphones on
You gotta speak into the microphone
Say what you
Say something
What, you, I thought you were gonna rap
Wait wait wait wait wait
You need to let, you need to let them know what your name is first, playa
What's your name?
No you got to speak into the mic, cause you keep freezing up
That's right let them know

Came to do what?
That's right, rap
And what you going to rap
Alright that's your, that's your jam

Not on my record we ain't singin no damn Michael Jackson
Ready?
Go ahead, ready?
Say it in the mic
Haha no I ain't say to say that
That's right lets do it baby
Hahahaha
Ah, you did it
Gimme five boy
You hit the booth!
Yeah!

N-n-n-not too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
Now life is a musical

I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said "hey hold up 'fore we put out another song"
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
Hey let's make a musical

Based on fict and faction
Or verse, vica throw in some action
And you got us well to a fraction
The Kast go Hollywood

Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us

Back when I was a freshman
I learned a valuable lesson
A ho gon be a ho and
It don't matter about you stressin'
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down, stainin her dress
She's making a great big mess, can I get something off your chest?
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun

I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you

Now that I'm a graduate, she still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
Joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise
Shoulda coulda and wit a uhhh
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one

Ain't talking about commitment, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
Ain't talking about no wedding ring, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
I hope you ain't a gold-diggin biatch, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop

I, I don't want no girlfiend

Girl, bye
I.e., get the hell on, I'm through, make me a sandwich, I love you
Only at this moment, maybe not tomorrow
Kisses, toodles
Ah, lil' me

In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn
Intergalatic tracks I make 'em like magstrulium
This one for scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one
Only you clean over
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen what I'm tryin to told ya
We fathers with seeds of our own
We're talkin about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones
Now that the theory gone wrong
An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold
Shaggy pass the boombastic
Daphne said don't do that
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic
Now Scrappy wanna box and throw them bows
So I had to sic the pitbull on him before he could pass one blow

Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy
Oh no, lost my last baggy of scoobie snackies
Shaggy wake up, we've been had
Our scooby snacks they got the whole stash
He said, who who, I don't have a clue
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scoobie Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'mma call Velma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin through the flash tryin to get our stash back
Roundin up suspects, collection' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby Doo when you need em?
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back

Break it down, break it down baby 'til the flow jumps off the ground
Ooo break it down lookin' over yonder til the walls come tumblin down
Ooo, yes lord y'ain't gotta tell me two times but you know I know
Ooo, break it down, break it down baby 'cuz I want y'all all to know
We rock the world

I coulda got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddlin kids

The feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle
Of the night and somebody in yo room
Your heart starts beating so fast, you can hear it pumping
The veins in your temples pulsate as you stare at the intruder
Then after a few minutes, you realize he ain't moving
So finally you let 'em hang and turn on the light
And the killer turns into your coat throwed over the chair
The feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning
And two or three motherfuckers cross the street
Your senses heighten, reflexes sharpen, vision's enhanced Adrenaline flows
As they rush across the street, you leave the print from the heater grip in your palm
Then your heart rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just going to the store
Many of us mistake phobia for true fear
Whereas fear is a gift from God to be used for self-preservation
Phobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence
Death is a small price to pay for respect
You know who it is; you know what it is

In these troubling times, a nigga like me be thinking of rhymes
That makes my quarters, nickels, plus my pennies and my dimes stack
Don't be looking for trouble, it be finding me
Try turning the other cheek
I understand but never mind that
Yes sir, guess the light is getting dim
At the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims
I never thought thirty spokes could attract so much attention
I gotta protect my own therefore I'm heated just like a kitchen
Full of pots and pan, Glock's in hand
Shots, rung out like ringin' the bells
And then that sucker nigga ran
Damn, I never thought that it would come to this conclusion
The folks that throwed us on them boats should be the one's I'm bruisin'
But naw, we don't see it that way
In '94 this is the real, it ain't no time for play play
Better believe the playas on the loose
Need to get they head screwed on tight
When it really get down to the nitty grit, who gon' fight?
Pipe, down
'Cause ain't no better time to crank it up than right now
We gots the Seagram crunk down here
And I don't hear nobody disagreeing
Orga-no-i-z-e, Mr. D.J. and me and Big Boi

So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob

See why in the muthafuck, do niggas be acting up
Do they want me to grab my shit and be lettin' that pistol go buck?
See I be gettin' stuck and stuff
Havin' to knock a nigga out about my clout
That's not what it's about
See yes indeed I got that weed like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces
That nigga the B-I-G be chokin' 'em out  and then I bounces
I got that lyrical flow to make a ho pull up her skirt
I drunk that Erk & Jerk, boi, thinkin' of future things to work on
I got my fuck on and then I took my clothes off
Washed my nuts up in the sink and then I got more nuts off
Cough, it's time to be out, sees bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp
I'm dirtier than the shit on the back of a shrimp
Now ain't that foul the way a nigga can spit that style
My nigga, I spit it, I did it, y'all suckas need to quit it
'Cause it's real

Well, it's that nigga that be wearing Nautica V-necks and Polo sweats
I got some food up in your thoughts and that cess off in your chest
See, living up in the Dungeon where we stayed in '93
See, that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yee
And when we rock it, niggas be jocking just like jock itch
You snitch, I fucked your bitch
See and my niggas G'd that ho
On the Southside of Campbellton Road
No slippin' in this pimpin', she was just a horny toad
See, I'm a mystery like the killing of Michael Jordan's father
Was steadily clockin' the hoes when I worked at Foot Locker
I'm gettin' higher than learning
Smokin' 'em up and then burning
East Point is on the map and now I close the curtains

Now shit done got boring ass
Molin' when XS closed down
But niggas kept soarin', steerin'
Stirrin', being the pharm assistant that missed
Other folks but some people tend to joke about this
But it's really dead serious
You can bet my lyrics
Now ya wonder why that we done stopped and got curious
Wanting to know where I'm from and where I need to be
Now that I know comfortable living give me meat
Can I get that; ya wonder why we split back
Lure us into pitch black dark
But I sit back and spark another one
To leave ya discombobulated in that dust
Living in a world where in nobody do you trust
Then hustlin' became a major trade, but...
Us in major trouble 'cause we made, uh...
Too many mistakes off in the past
Thinkin' you could make it this world and now we laugh
'Cause it's all false
Either way ya go, ya gotta pay the cost...

Spend your whole life
Educated and black, hangin' with the G-O-O-D-I-E Mob, nigga Yeah

Take you a li'l higher, knowwhatI'msayin'?
When you learnin', when you burnin' up that smoke
So you can choke on my quote
And get my ... down yo' throat
You just don't understand, youknowwhatI'msayin'?
Organized Noize for '95, bitch!

Gangsta hats, minks to match
Glass half full just sippin 'yak
Big Snoop Dogg 'bout to...
Me and OutKast just leanin' back in the...
Cadillac, rims intact
Got the blue gators and belts to match

Some people play crazy, some people play like they sane
Too much of data can make the mind overload
Scramble all logic, not even you can decode
Where are we going? Can we slip and we slide?
It doesn't matter just shut the fuck up and ride
I am, a multi-pimp, so fresh, so clean
Primp, primp, primp, in a...
Got the blue gators and belts to match)

I woke up early on my birthday, pimpin' in the worst way
Never come in last place, usually come in first place
First they chase me, lace me, and taste me
Keep me some Brandy, Cagney and Lace it
Face me, look at me, now tell me what you lookin' at
A P-I-M-P in wingtip Stacey's
Lately, hate me, it's all that they could trip on with
And know them niggas' bitch to hit
That I'm the one she kick it with
Run and hide, tell a lie, watch the P-I-stizi
O-U-T-Kizni, Dirty Siouth-sizni
The bitches love the way we ride
So if you ain't a big dogg, then I suggest you stay insiznide
I be, G S-N-double-O-P, E-S, LBC, you feel me?
You can't sell me, tell me, silly, gilly, hilly billy...

To the window to the wall, to the bathroom, bitch, don't fall
The 'Kast gone keep on humpin' and dumpin', and post up on all of y'all
Got my nigga Snoop Dogg, LBC, College Park, E-P-T
On the remix tip, we gon' sit and rim tip and wingtip
Like a boss pimp, not a lost pimp 'cause I...
Take Godzilla and the gator from Lake Placid
Manufacturing in a fashion, mashin', mobbin', stabbin'
You crabbin', your girl is sappin' and frampin'
I'm snappin' and trappin', dapper, debonair, dashin'
All I need is some Cognac, and a cold, cold cola, slashin'
Smooth, serious, smashin', multi-rubles matching
Toot that booty, I'mma toot the horn
I'm a player, every time they ask me in my...

Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean

Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts
And Monte Carlo's and El Dorados
I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo
Minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pender-grass cooler than Freddie Jackson

But you must have me mistaken with them statements
That you make 'cause

Canary yellow, seven-nine, Seville is on display
My nigga, Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples, YKK on yo' zipper
Lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard or sober

Six million ways to fold ya like Noah's
I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass round eightish
I know you'll be there for me girl

Those huge baby eyes, get to running off at they mouth
And telling me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
And inviting me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't, you're so Anne Frank
Rick James, 'n no chains and whips, I do suck lips 'til hips jerk
In double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha

And we are the coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my, the sky is falling, ain't no need to panic
But ooh, ooh, I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh, compatible created in the attic

My suit is dark my clouds are gray
And all things around me pass away
Well what if I leave
Yeah thats what I'll do I'll leave

Cause 88 keys is all I got to lose
That ain't much you can have those shoes

I'm dyin to love dyin to play
Dyin to get out of here

Ten years long, ten years strong
Lastin' long, verses long lastin'
Education, however, the difference between the two --
Which do you live, yo'self?
Luck of the draw, master plan without a flaw

Somethin' lastin' long leaves the compromising position --
Everything that isn't becomes questionable, unbelievable, and becomes weak at some point --
Done got straight blowed after hitting some danker's joint

Somethin' long lastin' --
Two Atlanta boys that became men of this industry
For them same ol' boys to be OutKast, raps out-blast and outlast the peers of the game
Move with the groove an' don't let the smooth groove fool you;
Together, makes Aquemini
Big Boi and 'Dre presents OutKast
So get ready to bump 808-style
To "The Speakerboxxx" and "The Love Below"
Two albums with the same ol' flow
Y'all enjoy it, y'hear?
Signin' off, man --

What if everything you ever knew or known was lost?
The knees'll tend to freeze you when you gatherin yo' thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause ya mind ain't free
Constricted by the muthafuckin boundaries, an ounce of weed
Or a pound of 'dro couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting
Life from Bro, Bra, bruh, Brother, Bro-ham
Cadillac on vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam
Wham nigga, wham! Don't they say that in their show, dad?
Fo' sho' man, you acting like a tadpole out of gonads
You know OutKast the truth, hit the booth, be makin' more jams
Spreading strawberry preserves on ya nervous program
Hello? Is anybody home? Is anybody giving dome?
Serve me up, I want some

Buggface, toe jam
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam

When I'm left alone, I get to thinkin to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left
Like everything is alright, clearly tight to def
And you can see me clearly through the window, paint drip but wet
With no tint, not deject.. clearly I'm a vet
Like the O.U.T.K.A.S. clearly nigga you know the rest
And if you actin like ya don't, then clearly nigga you tryna test
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway
Bugg!

Oh shit, Bamboo! You gonna break.. get outta here, you 'bout to break somethin!

Everbody on the streets
This a little thesis coming from me
When I throw up baguettes, sitting at the bar
Or smoking a little red life in my car
I don't know what you came to see
Nigga just out here feeding my kids
Throw up the duece and let me slide on by
Cause everybody wants to be a tough guy

Cruising down the street, minding my business cause I'm trill
Stopped at the ATM, grabbed a thousand dollar bill
Now I peel like apples and peaches because I'm chill
And niggas around my city respect me because I'm real
But still the things I see from day to day it irks me
When I'm off in the '79 Seville or the Bonneville
Niggas wanna hurt me, absurd G
I know it, betta believe I tote something for it
And I got a slogan like Nike but it goes like this, just know it
And I'm not the type of person be riding around your block just flashy
Just came to the store to get some black and milds and a lil bit of 93 gas,G
Wanna blast me, get sassy, say negative things about OutKast G
Riding all on a nigga dick, all you had to do was just dap me, come slap me
You the bad man, so go ahead and touch my cheek then
But we'll be burying you and your whole motherfucking family by the weekend
I'm calling your bluff, go on and buck, I got my squad we trapping
Aye C-bone gone slap this nigga, he ain't bucking, he just yapping, yea

Say, we took it from packing the pistols
To jacking this missiles, to stacking my crystals
Now my torpedo's even cracking your missile
When we start, ain't no stopping us
We too smart and too popular
Take your toys and we topple em
Resort to the dopplar
To the agent underground well known as Stankonia
Where trill as niggas go one and bad ass bitches be boning ya
I'm warning you, niggas i'll fill the middle of your moany
And make yo broad lick her pony up, its that platinum shit
Called zonia, tell Tommy blow me up
I ain't Mariah, bitch I'm the messiah can't no motherfucker show me up
UGK a set nigga, throw me up
Fuck catching a case bitch, i'll lace you and your homey up
Cause we the cream coming out of the crop
The steam coming out of the pot and the team coming out at the top
Your baddest or not, these niggas getting shattered or shot
Splattered for props, man you should'nt've left your gat at your spot

Pimp C bitch I'm a country star
I got a country mansion and a country car
I got a country bitch, I made a country son
I got some country nuts, I keep a country gun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
So if you pay me a mil, you gotta give that nigga one
Fuck boys talk shit, but them bitch niggas know
And UGK run the streets and we put dick in your ho
Whether weed or blow, I keep an open store
I keep my hair cut low, .44 on the floor
You can test me Snow, we got the glass for sho
Get your mind on your money, cause you playing with your dough
Bitches who ready to go, say you moving to slow
If you wasn't bout sucking it, what you fucking with me for
The quarters in the side in case you didn't know
I'm Sweet Jones Bitch and I'm an old school pro, pro, pro

Since the beginning of time, up to the present of now
There are beauty shop playas also intelligent clowns
Got they blue cuts with brown, booty grinding the ground
It's the sound that's created when we get up to get down
Stimulate my imag-ination with exag-geration of stanking light
That can't be right but we laughed
To keep from crying, sighing, hugged by cutie-pie and
Death defying acts of a Blacks not scared of dying
Y'all act like you never take no bubble bath
Gone to Blockbuster and act like you ain't never cuddled after
You poked her, stroked, soaked her, provoked her
To reach for the sky when she's high on your holster
I'm posed to, roast you, toast you, close you
Motherfucking mouth for I'm almost closed to the end
So when they ask you what school do you attend
Say Stankonia High, then throw two in the wind

From Texas to GA, niggas bleeding your speakerbox
Playas stayin' throwed, ho, putting diamonds off in your socks
Blowing killer, sipping lean, and dropping screens
North Dallas and Aquemini, fool, it's all the same team

Alright, you got to step,close to the mic
Gotta put the headphones on..

Watch out now!

Speakerboxx!

Talkin' hanging out wit' the D-Boi's
You know you a D-Boi
Cause when someone frontin' something 'S like havin' two daddies
One time my home boy fronted me a 8 ball at 3 oclock

It's rough bein' on that thang man
How you gonna front me somebody done fronted you?
He ain't no real real hustler, the dude shootin' at both of us
Hit you wit' a quarter pound talkin' bout 'we coming up'

A real D-Boi know you gotta get you own work
And you don't get high off your own supply
Til later on at night

I gotta drop of 'bout 30 keys
Car keys

We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams

The moon is now my sun and the nights are now my days
Nocturnal creature by habit, Bruce Wayne know what I mean
I mean, I'm in between sunset and sunrise
Since it's on, type of nigga for the home invasion, surprise-prise
Motherfucka, pow-pow, lay the fuck down now
Naw naw, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you
But it's simply overstood how you really 'posed to handle it
Pardon me one moment, I just went off on a tangent

Typical day off in the A, aye
But Nicks own the Chevrolet, aye
Nigga wanna rob, okay, okay
Where he stand is where he lay, aye
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes
Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust their motherfuckin' head
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

You're ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin'
We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'
As the wheels...
Keep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'
Now we knowin', holdin', showin', controllin'

New Outkast
For my dirty South Niggas

Out of the basement
Out of the dungeon
Look at Georgia boys
What have you done to them?
Rippin and sippin
Pimpin' and clippin'
And trimmin' up all the women
I'm swimming
But it's odd to me your words are kind of drippin'
I'm trippin'
Your flow's non-existant bitches missin'
Like Eric Robert Rudolf
Or Puss in boots with his boots off
Howdy doo boss
Check the southern slang boy I got a true drawl
From East Pointe to New York
It's OutKast and clue y'all

Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
Oh Outkast and DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the doo-wops and the fellas
Fuck the Haters and the Heathers
Like my flows and ho's alike
Cuz everything is 9 or better

Pissin' in the wind
Or shootin in the dark
Out on a blind date
Maybe fucking in the park
Without a rubber on
We are not alone
When I was younger songs
Now we are fiendin' for the new-new doo-doo
Stankonians activate that part of you that don't mo-ove
You think you're gettin' closer but you don't have a clue
Who only plays nines's and tens on the 1 and 2's

We can do it too
Funkanella, funkanella

Allow me to remove your crew of those Iceburg sweaters
Boy I've never seen soft punch a fella
I remain in, the company of insane men
I be the reason niggas in the jeep's will tuck they chains in
Keep it swingin'
Why you trippin'
Hey we brothers
I'm like why you sniffin'
I got a snort habit motherfuckers!!
Niggas up the ante
But all your high yella heffa, got you up her panties
Leave bitch niggas naked like D'angelo
Crying and close to dying on they grandma's flo'
If you tell us where the dope at then I promise we go
Stop crying, stop praying where the yeh at ho'
Don't you dare scream Jesus I can snuff your mouth
Money, dope, you let these D boys move out your house
Michael from Adamsville with a murderous look
Leave you shook and nigga Punchenella, punchenella
I urge to Rob, rob-a-Fella, rob-a-fella

Ayo rob that fellow man
And give me his god damn jewelry nigga
Hell yeah nigga
Strip down, strip buck naked for a nigga
Get that for it nigga
Strip nigga
Black on pop nigga
Man fuck that nigga

Now Slimm ain't havin' it
A DF advocate
Bustin' with Kast and Clue
Now Calhoun with a 'matic means
Shit can get tragic, mu'fucka
So what you gon' do
It's the deal pushing flash pan
The big deal change
I'm working up
Two in the back
Tocked out in the main
Keep this thing blowin' for the heathers and the hatas
Just got off the caper for the case in Decatur
Now I stacked up and sacked up in the back to the block
With eight bars to the heart
To asert it I chop
Keep working with 24 in the Glock
Major deep game, aquamini and Roc

Aquemini and Roc-A-fella

Oh Outkast DJ Clue

DJ Clue y'all
Hard Knock Life backstage
C'mon

You, you and you. All of you!!!

P.S. Lil ricky Walker - keep ya head up!

Extra special thank you's to...
Shanti "Shoestring" Das for being down from day one!!!
The entire Arista family, we don't know all the names yet, but we feel the love & support and it is much appreciated
All our dreams in Colon, Germany were not shattered after all. You already know what time it is
We would also like to give a shout out to the young men at Lorenzo Benn Youth Development Camp in Atlanta, GA. Keep ya head up!

Life
Ooooh, yeeeeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah yeah uh
Been always told to keep my head up
But cliches just don't cut the cake when your neck tired from bobbing
Life's a stage, street's the cage
We dungeon rats Outkast and Goodie Mobbin
Enough of the petite talk, I'd rather have a nigga with a perm
Ain't got to have punk, on my side than a nigga who frontin
To another nigga's interpretation of god-stuntin
My growth, why vote for president if he a spot guy
That's like choosing which bullet you gon' get shot by
A drank and some hot fries
Slowly eating me up from inside to outside
Well you gon' die anyway, right? Wrong
I plan to live forever, I know it seems mighty long
If you think about it in Earth terms
Thank god we on the TV what we let like earthworms
Stay underground like Cheers or Dig Dug
Only come above to shake hands and give hugs
Lay your beautiful body down on this fur rug
You got to give a damn if you do not give a fuck, ha!
Rack 'em up 'cuz we bustin'
Once was the nigga in the back of the class who never said nothing
His thought became an amplifier

Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it

Got issues on my mind like a fool from Columbine
Will I swallow my pride or take that ride?
Better think before my cock get slide and take a dive
Into this hot pit like oil and grits
Stand alone on my own ten toes against foes
It's a snowstorm and you outside gettin' cold
Luck has struck one buck for seven every roll
Throwin' snake eyes thinkin' a nigga gon' fold
Stand down like four black vogues on golds
Snatchin' all the dough and leavin' y'all broke
Going all out for an A plus in class
I bust ass walkin' barefoot over broken glass
Now who gon' pass player? You won't last
See we all in the race just taking up space
If we's on the other side of the track grab the straps
Thought y'all knew wild dogs run in packs
So who you think you foolin? We can get to dueling
On some old school shit, like we high schoolin'

There he is!

Get him!

Yeah, sucker! What'cha gon' do now? What'cha gon' do now sucker?

Let me walk you little kiddies through my school days
Sunday night I hit a party, missed a Monday, I'll go Tuesday
Doomsday, homeroom was lookin' beauty
The girl I wanna cut is absent but I see a cutie
But bump a flirt, I need to be doin' this homework to graduate
Saturate my body and memory on some algebrate
Bro, why you holdin' and totin' that's to assassinate
Go masturbate you jack-off, nigga take the hat off
I'm a third year freshman, I started with the best of them
But now them niggas done passed me, I'm just a baby daddy
O.G. Original Goofball, and I used to slang the hard heart
And smoke the soft softball saw through the way-hall
Niggas up in the school, they know my name, look!
But that's because my face is in like eight different yearbooks
Could've been took the S.A.T. but the streets got the best of me
Thinkin' and drinkin' and bankin' open while like sesame
Or cop out, is when you're thirty-something at your mom's house, yeah

It's OutKast for the books, I thought you knew so now you know

I made no wishes ‘cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back

The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um…

A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one…

When the player's ball is happening, all day e’ryday

Lyrics require transcription

Turn me up! Don't turn me down!
Cut me up! Don't let me down!

Find, find a way!

Find a way to get out, without a hit out! You dig in! You dig out! You get out! GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!
Find a way to get in, to fit in! You get on, you get out! Without a doubt!
GhettoMusick! GhettoMusick!

In the place to be and not to be at the same time!

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K stay down!
O-U-T-K-A-S-T best know that we don't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank
Then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish grandma could see us!

Hot tub! Back to the bony, I'm Tony!
Ask my grandma, Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me
In the state of Georgia
Hip Hop! Stand destroy ya!
He from the Dirty now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat!
Find my purpose on the surface of this earth is
Plane is standard to me they have no purpose
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame you obtain
You ought to be detained by the Hip Hop Sheriff
Locked up, no possibility of getting out
Because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear we disappear
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy because if not we gonna fight like...

I wanna be witchoo bad
Like juicy lookin' like pissin' on a hot stove, I wanna be witchoo baby
Just hang out like wet clothes whateva you wanna do
Well lemme tell ya, I wanna get witchoo baby, you know mean?
I gotta bake you a pie stand on the corner widda bowtie whatever it take to get witcha
I wanna be witcha
I can't marry you but I, I show up at the parkin' lot of the church but I ain't comin' in
I just wanna be witcha tho

The music's starting
My name is B-A-M-B-O-O
I'm so fast and everybody is slow
I'm so strong I can pick anybody up
I will throw you down and I will give you a pop

He drools a lot and he's sleeping a lot

You don't kill me like that!
My name is Cross
I am the boss
I'm a visiouse bowler
I wear a Polo – with the horse on it
I'm on it! I'm on it!
And I pop a wheely
If somebody speeds me I hit 'em!
I can't remember...
Can I dance?

Did I just hear yall say that new Outkast movie come out on Friday?

Yeah, shawty

Hell yeah I'm gon' be there, and who this fuck nigga is? Anyway, who he supposed to be?

I don't know, I don't know that nigga

See that's how niggas get jumped on. He better watch his mouth, talkin' 'bout actin'. He need to act like he got some sense up in this bitch

Hell yeah. Aye, you gonna buy me popcorn?

So, how would I look laid out on a table, huh? Come on, tell me

I don't know...well, you wouldn't take much

You're beautiful

You really think so?

'Bout the most beautiful thing I've seen in Idlewild. But then, you're not from Idlewild

What's up Sean?
Come here man, come here, come here, come here, come here

Got them bootleg Idlewild DVD's
Got Girls Gone Idlewild

The G version just in case
You don't want to see Three take his shirt off
I got the director's cut of Idlewild

I got that kush man, I got that 'dro
I got that purp', I got that light pink
Let me see your teeth
Boy I can make you a grill, right now

Gimme two, naw, your shit kinda buck
Give me about thirteen minutes
Dig what I'm sayin'?

Shit, I heard Big and Dre are
Supposed to be comin' up here right now anyway
Well shit man, let me drop on out of here man like a roller coaster baby
I'll get up witcha

Shh!

You trying to leave here without us?
Let me get a sample first

Keep your ass away from my husband

Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs, nothin' but them 'Lacs
You know what I'm saying? Yeah

Oh yes, I love her like Egyptian, want a description?
Like Kilroy, chill boi, because them folks might think you soft
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw ‘em
Thinking it's better for ‘em
I hate thinking that these the future mamas of our chill'un

Jazzy Belle
If you really want to be my star
Maybe we can mend a broken heart
If you really want to be my boo
Straighten up your shit
I’ll be with you

See, what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
‘Cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie, we got danky
You cracking ‘em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
‘Cause she’ll be Waiting to Exhale

See me and ol' girl in the black on black 'Lac Northstar
Talk bad about her nigga, guaranteed to snap like bra
‘Cause most of the girls that we was liking in high school
Nasty bitch

Deaf and fine, they be, asking me all about mine
How she doing, how she be
Off and On like Trends of Cultures, baby
‘Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

Now every day we looked up at the ceiling

Your mama and your cousin too

Smoking them white girls, before them blunts, got crunk, chunky asses
Where I live at, them rats know, "Mama I want to sing
But mama I want to trick, and mama I'm sucking dick now"

Well it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
I'm bending corners in my ‘Lac, boi
‘Cause that's how we be rolling here
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them empty bottles gots to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
To catch a buzz like a bumblebee, niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid ‘cause it ain't nothing see

Jump and you'll get you sprayed
Who raise your blocks? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, quickly
They ain't gon' get me, got something for 'em
The devil up in yo grill and you still don't even know ‘em
Show ‘em, who's the OK like collard greens and hoecakes
I got soul, that's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot-
Ten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale, swell
Swollen got my pockets
Business booming like rockets

Now players if you choose it
We’re gonna get cha high, high

Then I yell ‘ho’
And knock ‘em up off they feet like a Southern hustler ‘posed to do
I's in the house like… a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down, since we been broke
Taking ‘em deeper than a submarine
Look my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like pooper scoop
And every word I’ll say you can true

Well okey dokey KastOut
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that you rat?
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers it's your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge p-u-m-p
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel ‘til it's empty, get me?
See, I get friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the southernplayalistic shit
‘Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

Well Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all the, be rolling like that today, hoes
So back up off get up on it if you want it ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yep
While my niggas are at East Point
With that College Park, hemp-smoke style
Is how I wanna end it on this track

Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
Atlanta skies be blue
The sun is beaming, it’s seeming
That I’m glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side
Full of pride
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't braille but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches
Dungeon if y'all missed it

Well its the M I crooked letter comin around the South
Rollin straight hammers and vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothin but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bendin corners in my 'llac boi, cause that's how we be rollin here
Packin yo' heaters cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flow
Rollin steady in that caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See Juice and gin used to be my friend, from the beginning
Now i'm just a player sippin sauce, every now and then
Get sprayed like raid cause it ain't nothin

See my heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Hooray yo block the one and only OutKast
Many a nigga fallin fast and
I continue blastin, swiftly
Quickly, they ain't gon' get me, got somethin fo' em
The devil up in yo grill and you still don't even know' em
Show'em, who's the ok
Like collard greens and whole eggs
I got soul, thats somethin that you ain't got
That's why yo style is ro-tten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothin but pimps, fully equiped
Quick to make a sale, swell
Swollen got my pockets, business boomin like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that...

Its that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
We gonna get cha hiiiighh, hiiiighhh

Time to drop these bows, like Dusty Rhodes
We knockin em off they feet like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house, house like, a joint is lit fo my kin folks
Takin em deeper than a submarine
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sittin off in a Brougham
I'm packin my tag backwards if you want to be actin wrong
Word is bond like super glue
Its funky like poopa scoop

I swear to God I got the highest boomin cadillac
The expialalistic coupe de ville
Can you handle that you rat
I take my time cruisin round the city malls
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel til it's empty, get me
See I get friendly gettin in where i fit
So copy my slang and bite my shit
But don't try gafflin me
Cause sleepin you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

Well southernplayalisticadillacmuzik has been laid
I may wait for all the ... be rolling like that today hoes
So back up off and get up on it if you want it cha'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on player's ball yup

And Vogues for the hoes only when we rollin through
The sun is beamin it seemin
Full of pride, now ain't that somethin
