Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
Always talk 'bout what he did
Always talk 'bout what she did
Always talking fast as hell like Bone Thugs
Always thank the Lord
Always turn, oh
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original

And this is for sure
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies

And this is our clique
And this is the soundtrack
And this is what the future is to me
And this life is all a dream
And this life too crazy to think logically
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
And this one here, is a heat rocks
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
And this rich nigga racism
And this song was sort of like that moment where someone tells you ain't, you ain’t - you gotta say I am - an emancipation, if you will
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
And this the first time she ever spit her soul to me
And this verse only add to the freshness
And this verse so crazy when I finish
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
And time is somethin' you can never get back
And time is something you will never get back
And time is somethng tht you can never get back

And wake up every morning
And wakin up with a slight cough
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
And walked around the mall with his radio face off

But she got that dumb ass
But she not a virgin, huh, she a lady lover
But she not like you
But she started paging me like every single day
But she still wanna pump the yay
But she still want to toss me the drawers
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
But she was misguided, misled, and misunderstood
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
But shit it's still my favorite
But since they all fall in my palm, I'll take a trio
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
But since you feel like that this evening
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison
But sometimes we be playing the politics too much
But sorry we're closed
But still
But still supported me when I did the opposite
But still you've got to stay strong
But tell me, who am I to remind you? Who am I?
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
But that ain't no issue
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
But that's a lady lover
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
But the devil red, tires double tread
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud

In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
In small towns that I don't even know
In some relations you're just supposed to say none
In that brand new Escalade, metallic, black or beige
In that hoe mouth like a toothpick
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
In that special place
In the 1-9-9-9
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy - play some R&B
In the back off my six, fo' Impala
In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
In the beginning Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
In the best prime of their game and the same Kanye
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
In the city by the sea, bitch
In the city that's so pretty
In the clouds of the lear thinking of Shakir
In the clouds of the lear, thinking of Shakir
In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
In the club with Silicone Suzie
In the form that I’m ‘sposed to break down certain things
In the four dot six, bitch you can go ask
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
In the hood is an everyday happenin'
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
In the lab with Ian Connor by the way
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
In the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
In the milk white Phantom, the seats are ruby red
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
In the mornin', in the mornin'
In the morning sun
In the mother country's crotch
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
In the movie,I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
In the neighborhood, Power 106, it's all good
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
In the night I hear 'em talk
In the night I hear them talk
In the night I here ‘em talk
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
In the penthouse position
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
In the projects the objective is make dollars
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2pac died
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
In the showers!
In the streets
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
In the sweetest way her status and her habits are meet
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
In this give or take world I got what it takes
In this town again...
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
In this year or two
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
In what he dreamed
In your veins
Incase I catch a case
Incorporate Young Hov and that's The Blueprint 3
Indeed the boy, had that sweet street magic like David Blaine and she made it plain
Indian hair, no moccasins
Infrared make you juke like Walter Payton
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Inside the pussy, man, I know just how Lamar felt
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
Instead of runnin round lock one bird down
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
Instead you stay up
Instead you stay up, countin every second like a fake Roley
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Into real life real life, if you try to
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
Intro
Introduce her to shit
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' ’bout
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Is anybody in the house right now in love right now?
Is anybody in the house right now that’s in love right now?
Is because you be paying

Is het not?!
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
Is it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?
Is it better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all?

Is it genocide?
Is it my fault that I make you heartless?
Is it ok now?
Is it the because my beats the nicest

Is prolly get a single like Alicia Keys
Is she thinking of me
Is that bitch still stripping?
Is that me feet don't fail me now
Is that pronounced N-Y-C?
Is that the fact that it's not my problem
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Is that what you said? Exactly
Is that you..
Is that your girlfriend
Is the good life better than the life I live
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like..
Is this the price to pay for the icy way?
Is this thing on?
Is this what I’ve done
Is to feed you every single thing you hunger for---
Isn’t that why you do it? Isn’t it the process? Isn’t it the point to do it?
It Ain’t Safe
It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
It ain't a song, it's a video called Dave Meyers
It ain't about who really hot no more
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
It ain't happen yet
It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend
It ain't in your direction, so I passed her like a reverend
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect
It ain't no mystery, it's meant for me to make history
It ain't nothin' with my real niggas
It ain't nothing to it but to do it
It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here
It ain't ok, ok, ok
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
It ain't that you underrated
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah
It be goin' in and out like a robbery, ah
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be going in and out like a robberia
It be going in and out that's why I barely hear ya
It been like this
It brings back a lotta memories
It came out the North, it came out the South
It can feed a man's daughter
It caused the commissioner to throw a cap on everything
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
It could help out when you need revival
It definitely will
It didn't make a difference
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
It don't take much brains to know we bust things
It falls upon something that's inside us
It feel like D.C. it feel like D.C
It feel like L.A. it feel like Miami
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
It feel like VA or the Bay or Ye
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
It feels like we're changing
It feels like you're on trial sometimes
It feels so good to be free
It gets scarier, or should I say it's scary
It go my way, Chi-Way
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
It got me walkin' all slew-foot
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
It have you so right, you drive on the left lane
It hurts but it may be the only way
It hurts, but it may be the only way
It is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a weepin' and a mournin' swerve
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a— when it comes to my sound swerve
It is a— when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
It just made me feel like I had to say something
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
It looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I’ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.
It made me...
It makes it easier, easier to bear
It makes you really smart, man
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
It may not be what we want
It may seems we living the nigga's American dream
It mean second place is the first one who lost
It really ain't my problem
It really hurts my soul when I hear about that
It says We need a new tomorrow
It seem like everybody dress tight now
It seem we livin' the American Dream
It seems I always keep it moving, I don't hit nothing twice
It seems the sun never shine, that we searchin' for
It seems they always keep on movin, I don't hear nuthin twice
It seems we living the American Dream
It seems we living the american dream
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyselves
It was famous for lakes?
It was more like spoken word
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
It was my idea and now a nigga 30 hours
It was real if you made the news
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
It was televised
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
It wasn’t that funny, to be honest with you. It was a five, I’d give it.
It went on and on and on and on
It won't be long 'til y'alls get more of what y'all gettin' right here
It won't fit fit
It would be just a waste of time
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
It wouldn't make me not feel so sick
It wouldn’t be wise to bet against the kid
It'd go, get this difficult
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again
It'll bring back a lotta memories for y'all
It'll go get this difficult
It'll send her body into a seizure
It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
It's Common and Kanye y'all niggas know what time it is

It's been racin' since the summertime
It's been ten

It's feeling like Hell rings
It's from the heart anyway
It's funny

It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes

It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday
It's hard enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough, it's hard enough
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
It's honor, appreciate it
It's how you can sit in the freezer
It's impossible
It's impossible for me to fail baby, I gotta keep on movin'
It's impossible for you to ever get with me because of how I ride on the track
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice on the Bulgari watch
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
It's just impossible it's impossible
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through
It's just the memories that you have
It's just you fucking up my high, can't a nigga smoke in silence?
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!
It's life, we got a hundred years down here
It's like I don't even know ya
It's like I'm back bein' a delinquent
It's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something
It's like I'm lookin out there, tryna find something
It's like a dream come true
It's like before the pop fame came to pour
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
It's like gettin' robbed without a pistol
It's like old folks pissin cause it all depends
It's like somethin' outta nowhere
It's like stoppin' a train
It's like that old Michael Jackson shit
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life

It's like the only thing that kept a pimp from crying is laughing
It's like the singer say
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
It's looking like, I don’t know how to lose
It's love, appreciate it
It's makin' me nervous, I found my bird in my book
It's more than a feeling ain't it?
It's more thatn you're under dated
It's more ways than they way to do it
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
It's not supposed to be??
It's on--baby, let's get lost
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
It's one of the best to touch microphones
It's only 60 seconds in a minute, 24 hours in a day
It's only two places you end up, either dead or in jail
It's orientation
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
It's possible, goddamn right
It's really me
It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
It's so packed I might ride around
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
It's somethin' that you need to have
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
It's that I give most of the fuck and I'm not givin' up
It's that life okay, okay
It's that old Michael Jackson shit
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
It's the Roc throw your diamonds up in the sky
It's the dream, it's Kobe and Jordan on the same team
It's the most consistent, Hov
It's the new God flow, niggas
It's the nigga they love to hate
It's the softest place on Earth
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
It's tight I had to force it
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip your frame up
It's time to get the paper
It's time to hit the dancefloor, you crazy again
It's too big big
It's too early in the conversation anyway
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
It's too much

It's too strong strong
It's too tough tough
It's too wide wide
It's unbelievable you see my warning gives you big chills
It's upside down that for the A-Town
It's upside down that's for the A-Town
It's us against them you'll see
It's weak, the benz coupe is so sweet
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
It's ya boy Kanye To The
It's ya boy Kanye West on the beat

Its Compton's prodigy obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Its feelin' like rose wood
Its good, Its good uh
Its ironic whats happening
Its kinda tragic to see, this young woman cut in half
Its like, guess who's bizzack, back on the track with the blow
Its no verse that would reverse the-
Its so cool bein' my new chick ain't it?
Its still a new slave
It’s Friday morning
It’s Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It’s a beautiful thing that in a country that was so divided by the concept of black and white
It’s a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
It’s a lack of decency.
It’s a war going on outside we ain’t safe from
It’s all in time, my nigga
It’s been a lot of confusion in the past 3 weeks so let me apologize for in any way being confusing
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
It’s been like that now for a minute
It’s cool, ’cause I can’t see yo’ ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!
It’s gonna be slow singing, flower bringing
It’s guys like you that run companies and don’t invest in Ye even if I’m your kid’s idol!!!
It’s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
It’s kinda ill though
It’s kinda like trading places huh? I never plug
It’s like I wanna spit something written
It’s like I’m fighting to be me, but I have to leave the fight
It’s over
It’s snobbery--
It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s still February, right? security guard shakes his head, everyone laughs
It’s still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
It’s the biggest part. It’s our earth. Like you remember like, that you see future movies and everything was in the sky, like it moved to the sky
It’s the first thing that came to my mind.
It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power
I–I–I–I–I'm in that two-seat Lambo

Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' out my window
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
Looking at some photos that I’m looking crazy dope on
Looking at the news like damn! I was just with him after school
Looking extra fly
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
Looking for somebody that's flawless
Looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
Looking in the mirror I can see the real contender
Looking like Bryant Gumbel
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh!
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Looks like I'm a have to test you in and out

Those on clouds
Those who ain't even black use it
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn’t make it
Though it's thousands of miles away
Though paper can't change a man's aura
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
Though the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian
Thought I was gon' rhyme that, no you didn't time that
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
Thought she was the one but she couldn't do the math
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back, back
Three niggas and one hoe, turn bitches to Jane Doe
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Three, four, better lock your door
Three-piece, cuff links and the accoutrements
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Through the days and nights
Through the doctor's exact calculations
Through the fire
Through the fire I'd gladly risk it all right now
Through the fire It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall Y'know what I'm saying?
Through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pajama shit
Through the wire
Through the wire to the wall
Through whatever, come what may
Through whatever, come what may It's a life-or-death situation, man
