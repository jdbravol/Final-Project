Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain, when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead; yuugh!

"You better change what comes out your speaker"

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis, either that
Or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick, your son dope, nigga
I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession, let's get it

"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"They must be on the dick of who?"



Ha ha ha ha ha

Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

Them niggas ain't dying for you

Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get

And we know that

Contract all fucked up
I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Fuck you playing games for
Don't be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big shit
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by yourself
Ask Steve Jobs, wealth don't buy health

Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that

What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time



Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it

Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right

My whole team winning, no vision on quitting

Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it

Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
Raah, I make these mothafuckas hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living

I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missin' a S, nigga
Your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leapin' from the free throw

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day, God

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards



It's the blackout, 'Rari got the back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house
Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels, UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem
Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin'
Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks
Is a must, like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Um, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly
Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', "West side!"
With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the

With the Re-Up's a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top
Of your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Girl, I'll trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl

Started out as just a fuck mission
Who'd have thought I would've fucked with ya
Dope boy, they got trust issues
Never imagined being stuck with you
Years later, we in the villa suites
Top back, we on vanilla seats
Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
C-Class helped you see past
All them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
Whoo! I'm good money
Got you talking in dollar signs
It's all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
I don't blame her, I don't change her
I just sit back and give her options
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam
Every baller gotta know she's sponsored
Whoo! You earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back


Locked phones, past tense
Pass codes, we past this
Pass time, Presidential
Rolexes, both sexes
Blue bezel we both flexing
Big diamonds, we Bowflexing
Pitch dope, touch down
Both sports, I'm Bo Jackson
Your bitch fronting, that's you
My bitch stunting, that's me
I break it down, then break her off
I'm breaking bread, and that's key
We everything that they talk about
Know them haters be watching
Them bitches lurking -- your page locked
And they still know when you shopping
They still know that I'm balling
You still know that I'm all in
Your ex nigga, your next nigga
Gon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling
Whoo! But you earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back


Please don't mind
I just need some time
These requirements
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki
And again I say I like these hoes




Dis type ah shit happen everyday
All dem a gwaan dem heart softer than clay
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK

All praise to the most high on both sides
I pray to God, I pray for hard, I won't lie
Multi cause I'm dope-tied, convo and a boat ride
Rent-a-cars for the whole month, drop Porsche money, no co-sign
Yuugh, my records ain't got to sell, nigga
Woo, go diamond off of my cell, nigga
Give a fuck what you sells, that chance come, I take mine
I ball hard, you bench ride, so fuck you and yo' baseline
No Soundscan for a bricklayer, square nigga, you a brick hater

Dopeboy to the rescue, bad bitches get the best view
Lotta money just floatin' round, all them hoes feelin' special
Woo, I know the rent due, fuck me right and it's sent through
Third time you done used the line, God damn, she a pimp, too
Teamwork make the dream work, all my niggas done seen work
All my niggas ain't make it through, so much death that my dreams hurt
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas

I got dollars on my blocka

To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta

Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing
The ultimate misdirection ya

Your husband was drug dealer
For 14 years he sold crack cocaine

Federico Fellini in the flesh
Sergio Tacchini inside his mesh
Bitch I been brackin’ since the ‘80s
Google me baby, you crazy
’89 in London pull the Benz up
Type it in, Google’s your friend bruh
14-year drug dealer and still counting
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
He been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit
IRS should’ve had the townhouses surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer
I tore the floor up
Yeah, that’s for the Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk though the garage it’s like multiple choices
I told ‘em pull the Royce up
I’m getting ghost, I’m hearing noises
I think it’s the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries ‘em
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Bling bling
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley ‘bout me
Ask the Federalis ‘bout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, “Gimme 12”
He told them to go to hell about me
Drug dealers anonymous
Y’all think Uber’s the future, our cars been autonomous
Mules move the drums, take ‘em to different spots
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs
I’m a course of miracles with this shit
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn’t find a decent job
Life made me ambidextrous
Countin’ with my right, whippin’ white with my left wrist
Daaaaaaaamn Daniel
FBI keep bringing them all white vans through




Lyrically I’m, untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it’s getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can’t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like, interior gauze
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling’s open, I Cross-Fit the coca
Yuugh! It’s a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and ain’t nothin’ rented
Yeah, wearing Dri-Fit in my shit
It rides a little better in the cockpit

Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Mu told me to switch styles
He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial
He tells me I miss out on all that club money, I don’t bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that don’t bounce
The president of G.O.O.D. Music has been announced
A quarter million a year and that don’t bounce
I’m in the score of these movies, I’m losing count
Mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
My breakdown game bought me ‘8 Mile’ fame
Selling Eminem to him and ‘em
White to the Blacks I’m a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let’s talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix “Narcos”
Part on the side of my 'fro like I’m Pablo
No hablo, I sell blow
Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho
Yuugh, let’s take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
It’s looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jesús, I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight, I done ran it off
I’m walking on water, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push

Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600




I don't never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
Money goin' in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, get money, babygirl, gold chains
I don't never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
Standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I ain't never did a thing, getting money, rocking chains
We'll never feel the same, we the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain

18 wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money screaming "encore"
Spending nights with the prime whore
But that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac above the rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we're even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Might as well, they gon' nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the feds knock at your door

I dont never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rocking tons of gold chains
I dont never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring

Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
This is drug dealer brilliance
Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on the judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'Cain
Push, my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Tre-eight on, coulda been Trayvon
But instead I chose Avon
Powder face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
It's a match made in heaven
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message

I dont never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rocking tons of gold chains
I dont never feel pain, cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring




*Kanye West harmonizes for 25 seconds*

I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain’t hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Water colors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

I was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home

Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on




This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided
If you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar

But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress

'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!

Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout Caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference between me and Hova

But I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!



Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic
Now you celebrate, motherfuckers, raise your glasses
Push...

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always 'F it'
Thirty-five years of marriage and my momma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is, did you enjoy the dance with him>
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby, now he’s transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I’m Jordan versus Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres
Push!

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres



You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit that y'all wanted
This shit cook up hard, don't it?
Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like Boondocks
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, ah!

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit y'all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch, I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it



I see the strangest things
The evil that money brings
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens
And they wanna bury me
Why? Cause I’m anti everything
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

The three leading killers of you niggas
Is the shit that’s most appealing to you niggas
Even I fell victim to it, your pride don’t let you do it
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn’t ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what’s the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
Won’t unveil it yet, can’t tell it yet
Defense wins games Bill Belichick
These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check
Yuugh

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

Shout out my bitches fucking baseball niggas
That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts
Yeah, I see your vision, sick of prison visits
Now the Major League’s where you're fishing
You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can’t judge you ‘cause we ain’t hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love ‘em, make ‘em spare no amount
Make ‘em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you’re worth it
Real bitches worth it

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

I’ve been watching all you real niggas
I done seen more won't than you will niggas
Take a swing, snatch a chain
Lose your mind, go insane
I’m in the club, you in the club too
I got money, you got money too
You think it’s honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here
It’s no pictures, now you in your feelings
I’m a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos
I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money
I get it done for quarter ki money, for real

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all




Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it’s easy acting like Mitch
“Paid In Full” was more than reading a script
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water?
Yeah, while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh, I’m drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it; Rodriguez
The illusion of money we don’t believe in
You ask me, Tyga looking like a genius
I’m Kim Jong of the crack song
Gil Scott-Heron to the black poem
Woo, the revolution will be televised
‘Cause we done see all and they telling lies

Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it’s easy being my bitch
It’s only right for a queen to floss your shit
Rolex crowns, I emboss your wrist
The minimums, niggas ain’t synonyms
Dual exhausts, driving flying saucers
Diamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didn’t know what the goal was?
Shine, remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad
Ahhh, my living room rap scream crack money
I don’t trust rap niggas or rap money
See this air hole tech and get ratttttt from me

Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

Niggas talking it, but ain’t living it
Two years later admitting it, all them niggas is renting shit
They ask why I’m still talking dope, why not?
The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilà
They say it’s hate, but it’s these well-dressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh, you ain’t know, you got coached through it
Wooo, the rap fans got hoaxed through it
Haaa, the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga, and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Chess moves on your checkerboard, king him
Yeah, this is gun slingers and Goyard
Uh, this is O Dog in the courtyard
You wonder why I’m still here
I’m America’s worst nightmare
Night, night nigga

Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!



Yeah... I just ordered one, my nigga
Yeah...

I’m still a snow mover, blow harder than tuba
Designated shooters, turn weed to woolers
Condo in Atlanta, money counters like the NASDAQ
In that glass back, the motor is the ass crack
I’m still feeding divas like I feed the meter
Holy father to 'em, I ain’t talking Jesus neither
Balance on the scale, I ain’t a Libra either
I’m just a name and a number with the means to reach ya
Grim Reaper, him cheaper, hemp chiefer
His army, MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin' that hymn better, he been preaching
You motherfuckers is bloodsuckers, you been leeching
Been Baller, been Jacob, been dealer
Been realer, pound sign, been trilla
All killer, no filler, been iller
Fraud niggas, you Zoolander, Ben Stiller

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way

Between a renter and a homeowner
Hip Hop Weekly cover and a Rolling Stoner
Lufthansa I heist, nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers 'cause they in their moment
Might have crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
Don't make us equal 'cause we shared a bitch or two
She ain't the angel that you think, she reincarnated too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the Bible don't burn, like these bullets don't spiral
Like I can't see the scenes that you mirror in your idol
But a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
Ooh! Suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way

Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The roof is a translucent, it's nothing but glass there
The car is a concept, what's next is my last year
My future is bright hot, you never can last here
I'm top five, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here
'Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Story of the sheep and the wolves I unmaster
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked, powder rise and it falls like Sebastian
Telfair, tailor-made suits hand crafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high tops unfastened
S550 drop top is unimaginable
To my hand drop and then he unattached it
Practice it, niggam brick, break down, break dance
Crab walk, back spin, tanner than my black skin

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way



Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Hey mama, come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dollar thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see-through V1, V2
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
Christians or Chloe, damn, them C's too
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
I know it ain't cheap for you to lay here

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Let's get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother’s CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It’s only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I’m from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all 'cause the money don’t last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin', "Honey, don’t ask"

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you



Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, "it ain't adding up"
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing up
I never thought I'd had have to question "Were you man enough?"
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home"
"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome"
I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying...

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing, once he told me that...

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!



This shit I wrote quick
Shit I hate
Broke niggas, that always got something to say
Got some nerve to have an opinion

I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh

There's a meaning to the kissin' of the ring
The gods don't mingle with the mortals
Peasants ain't sittin' with the kings
Goliath ain't worried 'bout your sling
And Cassius ain't bothered by your swings
You niggas keep rappin' 'bout your dreams, my reality
50 birds waitin' in the wings
Do it my way, I hit the highway with the batter
So when Kanye go on his hia', it don't matter
Since you talking 'bout me, then let's talk about this money
Let's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Lets' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me
Lets talk about the fact you niggas hate I'm up and runnin'
RG3 nigga, be that
Runnin' through this money and these white women
Spike Lee see that
She gotta have it and I gotta give it
And you do not relate cause you niggas do not live it, no


Attention seekers beware, I will grant wishes
We can take this so much further than your mentions
I can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance
Have the whole world view the body
Since y'all claim I'm Illuminati, tell me why would you try me?
Kennedy, John F., or Bobby
Almost caught Reagan, but they stopped us at the lobby
And that was broad day, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?
You lil' niggas just dirty mine's is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision, witch huntin', ride for Pac worthy
I'm coke boy leanin' on you niggas
If money talk then I must be screamin' on you niggas
Top of the pile I was two thirds away
I was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day, God
Death is just a U-turn away
Two men ten paces then you turn and spray


My Name is my name!




Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band

Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock
I was thinking 'bout murdering
I ain't getting my hands dirty
Let you worry 'bout serving 'em

Woooh! They said be all you can be, nigga
Woooh! They said be all you can be, nigga
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

They said be all you can be, nigga
They said the truth set you free

Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you, hallelujah
Pour it on you, hallelujah, pour it on you, hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight, all day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

They said be all you can be

Pretty girls is my reputation, one on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand in hand
When you got this paper hand in hand-hand
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy
'Cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

They said the truth set you free!

Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends



Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Say hi to the bad guy, say ahhh to the champagne
Got a call from my jail niggas, said I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing
Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down 'til they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go?
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought up in the PJs
If I leave today, throw the keys away
But I'mma live today, I wanna see tomorrow, I wanna lead the way

Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Momma had me in the ghetto, I was raised in the slums
Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums
Bought me a 5 for 50, I bust 'em down, it was jumps
Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle got power, now I see him in another ten
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this power, this masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower
Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale
Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back, can't you tell?
In the hood, I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a Chariot, I got mine in a Regal
Sport cars, Italian leather, Princess Cut with baguettes
Law of physics say them 9s weigh more when they wet
No regrets

Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Presidential, I came back, April showers, I rains back
Jumped ahead like June something, still I'm wheeling that Maybach
Time forward, my braids back, Tom Ford and my shades black
Dope boy with a cape on, super-sizing that beige back
All white like Gotti said, Ye told me I'm outta here
And you could buy a pair, twenty or more and we'll fly 'em there
How you acting like I'm ain't here? D-Boy and I pioneer

Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...



Yeah
Uh-huh
Beautiful evils
Yeah
Check me out

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
My young niggas sic' ‘em
I don’t get ‘em
I just get back their jewelry if I’m fuckin’ with ‘em
Your man crush Mondays be owin’ niggas
My skin is triple black, I’m the omen
You can’t kill a God like the Romans, uh
Take my time to craft shit
‘Cause I don’t like back and forths with Puff about rap shit

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Rappers is victimized at an all-time high
But not I, you pop niggas thought I let it fly
I’m Yasiel Puig, I’m in another league
I defected, only thing we have in common, niggas bleed
In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars
Is there shame when a platinum rapper’s mother lives in squalor?
Mildred’s in the Bahamas for the month
She’s probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch
Swordfish, my reality is more fish
Banana clips for all you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas
Ha Imagine that, where you from nigga?

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is death by the masses
The only asterisk is the change of address
My infinity pool as long as Magic’s
Yeah I let Zillow change my pillows
The home is so inviting, the Porsche is the armadillo
The silhouette
The pop, pop, pop; the chop, chop, chop
The throwaway TEC's got Tourettes 
It’s more than this drug money, I love money
I speak to your soul and that’s above money
This the ministry of street energy 
The church of criminology, teaching my chemistries
Woo I’m the L. Ron Hubbard of the cupboard
To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims




I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did

She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911 you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't grow by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

Fear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters
About $14,000 dollars worth in 20s
Brown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Long live the caine coming soon
Malice my brother I love you
Liva Don 'til the end nigga




Espera, ven aquí, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mío. You gotta pick one, daddy

Leave your conscience at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I done been black balled 
And never gave a fuck ‘cause I’m Jack Frost
Of sellin’ that blast off
I’m on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I’m my brother’s keeper, Lord Willin’, keep grindin’
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Still held back, I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it’s murder was the case homie
I’m watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don’t roar, so the clowns ain’t nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it’s off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you’re dead
They take samples of ‘em, I make examples of ‘em
It’s the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered
Ask ‘Ye who’s loyalty more realer
Ask P, who’s core’s a drug dealer
Me and Tim, it's coming, it’s gonna kill ‘em
The only great I ain’t made better was J. Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!





It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

Two sides, what the game'll do
Bring money, fame to you
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Standin' on it like a pedestal
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'


Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know




Re-up gang, G.O.O.D. Music, Def Jam
I love my family

The nerve of you
He’ll sit and clip at your lines like he ain’t heard of you
I seen it happen before, that man will murder you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
Tiptoe-in' but the whole while cloning
The elephant’s in the room, the bitch glowing
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn in
She walk like its her's but the whole world knowing
Told niggas it’s the new god flow
It’s that New Testament and the old God knows
And you new niggas don’t get to pass go
I’ll monopolize Boardwalk Empire flow
So don’t mention me in the same breath, I’m Genghis
Just venting I never wished to be famous
Truth told I’d much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin’ niggas to angels
Local niggas hatin’ but I can’t blame ‘em
Clear the road to the riches but I can’t pave ‘em
Put Trey up on your hook, still couldn’t save ‘em
Better chance with a snowball hitting Satan
Dreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFly's
Now I’m back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive

Don't fuck with me
You see
There's a lot of people out there to be fucked with
I am not one
Re-Up Gang
Don't fuck with me

Rappers on their sophomores, actin' like they boss lords
Fame such a funny thing for sure
When niggas start believing all them encores
I’m just the one to send you off, bonjour
See yourself as I pull up in that mirror tint
Skins vs. blouses, you mirror Prince
Chappelle Show, all of you Neal Brennans
Sketch comedy, who was for real pennin'?
The talk don’t match the leather
The swag don’t match the sweaters
And wolves don’t walk with shepherds
These Margiela verses all you mall dwellers
Off-the-rack suits looking like pallbearers
Coffins for my old bitches’ orphans
Daddy’s MIA like a dolphin
Play the Fendi bucket like a shark's fin
Cool J-ing on you bitches but I’m dark-skinned
We walked in, seats courtside, dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk by
At the US Open, there’s much more to Queens
Versace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene
Dreams money can buy
Three racks just spent on my Marty McFly's
Now I’m back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive

Push..no shots...but nothing goes unseen




In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen


You like that don’t you? I wrote it myself by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish
But I picture myself getting paid
And you might catch pneumonia
'Cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m trying to get paid

Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was trying to get waves
I’mma let all ya’ll niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back-end
Only fucking way I’mma pay for it
Front that shit, you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
#1 spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
"Glow In The Dark" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas stepping in my lane for
Not knowing that it’s a land mine
Soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood
Solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers I’mma flood
Black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion gods, notice mine
Rollerball spikes, I’m Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights, where do you belong?

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, how many people do you know hatin’?
On your downfall sitting their waitin’
When you shine, don't know what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadiums
So tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil’s pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God’s chap
Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck
I need the ice, I need the lights, uhh
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over for no reason, beat him

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Saleen, yeah that’s a Mustang
Break ‘em down in the night, that's what I call hustling
They say they want that dumb shit, well this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, yeah now that's ignorant
They like, "Young, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on 75-75, when they was going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey? Just an ordinary day
With extraodinary pay, extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, “Don't you fuck with me”

Please Lord, help, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen




King Push
Razor
Execution

The devil is a lie
You ain't broke bread 'till you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise
Them wings don't fly
Your traitor is your neighbor
At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper
Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath
And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street
It's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the Earth
The weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should have perished at birth
Still born or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life, or your loved ones
Straight razor or a snub-gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero, but he unsung
I'm the one

Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved
Now make a move
These guns whistle, sizzle up dudes who got big mouths, no power
Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans
A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale
I fuck with golf now, Shala is ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo
Or chilling on a beach in Boca Chica with tuna
Salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since
1984, the blow was just more
Then we would come trough with rifles rocking Nike boots and war
A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption

Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin

God, I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with the lasers under Rugers
Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation
Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork
The runners; footwork
The custies took work
The soldiers put work in
On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work
That's just how the hood work
Northface bubble with, eight bundles under it
Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs
Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs
That's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas
Y'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second hand swepped across that pretty Breitling
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling
Whatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team


In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils
You know my origins is over when
Fat black bitch singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it
All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent
When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain cause my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner
This music to my soul, cause it's death before dishonor
Gone

Check!
Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to cop a new Beamer
Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through
It’s the microphone Methadone
Greatest ever etched in stone
You ain’t getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone
Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Nigga I’m your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I’m a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if you embarrass us with style
Cause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down
So tell em why you're mad son
Gotta get it off your chest
Let em know how you feel son
You gotta say what you say
It don’t matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway



I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

America, you need a miracle
Beyond spiritual 
I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda’s baby next door to the candy lady 
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can’t hear it over gun play 
Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose
Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain’t enough proof
So we still lose

I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

I don’t got no march in me, I can’t turn the other cheek
While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it’s either you or me
Let the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me

It’s more and more and more than Baltimore
From shore to shore, oh lord
Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord

I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long



Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all's forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons, no room for George
Yeh, the fear of God’s in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change
First class flights, Ciroc soaked nights
Waking up to models, what a motherfuckin life



I can’t be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow, so that my core follows
We don’t mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I’ll be damned
Gator at my momma’s house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler’s paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face
Cause the batter I add had the coca base
When you get to heaven’s door they won’t hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker’s face
There’s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right
You know you’re up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
I’m a wizard at it, nigga here’s the magic
Make a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic

Yes! My God!

The Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here, so I’ll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say they feel it but say it hurts
No pain, no gain, nigga
They say I’m heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 012 a year early, I’m a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
They’ll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I’m here now, nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
It’s the new god flow, ain’t it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted





Tell her throw that ass in a circle
Throw that ass in a circle
Tell her show what that work do
Tell her throw that ass in a circle
Tell her throw that ass in a circle, yeah
Geeked up, bitch, Urkel
She gon' throw that ass in a circle, yeah
Throw that ass in a circle
She gon' throw it back for a boss
Look back for a boss
Make it clap for a boss
Clean it up for a boss
Gettin' head in my drawers
Gettin' head with my drawers on
Party Friday like a boss
Maserati like a boss, ayy, yeah

Put you in all that designer
If we get high, you could be my supplier
You can get lost once you find her
We gon' get high, we gon' need a lil' higher

Yeah yeah, throw that ass in a circle, now
Show me how you been workin' now
I just wanna be certain now
Surgery's the new workin' out
Love the way that you perkin' out

To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I’m what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin', that’s Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on ‘em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I’m Scott free with a million dollar bright smile

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of

Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I’m still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More pony hairs, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I’m what dreams are made of
I’m what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I’m what dreams are made of
I’m what dreams are made of



Half a year later, still ain't heard an album greater
The natives want me out of the office, back on the pavement
Jokers at the top know the king is nothin' to play with
9 to 5 money is just as sweet as the grave shift
El presidenté, Blobama, blow by ya
Chopper next to me in every picture, Osama
Oh mama, they question my starting line up
You only find a diamond from diggin' like coal miners
Don't listen to 'em, Desiigner
Chanel dad hats, but you don't know that they got 'em
Trap door shopper, they rotate the wall
So you will never see me as you rotate the mall
330 spin, cook a steak up on this grill
Me myself and I, we like a hamster in the wheel
Rolls emblem, Black Virginian
Pull in a neighborhood I don't blend in
Album of the year contender every year
The kitchen's full of work, it's blenders everywhere
Blended bitches everywhere that do the most
They never seen with him so they fuck his ghost
Invisible man, timepiece with the invisible hands
MJ, remember the time they counted in sand hourglass
But mine come with purse and heels
And the DIY Gucci with the crest and shields
It's too far gone when the realest ain't real
I walk amongst the clouds so your ceilings ain't real
These niggas Call of Duty cause their killings ain't real
With a questionable pen so the feelin' ain't real
Rap's John Grisham
The bar's been lowered, the well's run dry
See I'm so top 5
If they factor in the truth I just might blow by
Blowbama




Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dopeboy quotable

Mami tryna land a Sinatra
So she don't fuck niggas with Apple watches
Cause Rolex shopping is more exciting
Shout out to dopeboy lit 16 swipers
Howard homecoming kingpins
Movie on my neck with the screen gems
Me and my nigga havin' bottle wars
A Blu Ray to your DVD
You might've caught me on TMZ
Cause I party hard like it's three of me
America's still abusing us
And 9/11 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldn't I fire back
When everyday them niggas shooting us?
True enough, I'm out of line
You better stand for something 'fore you out of time
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dopeboy quotable

Poppy get me everything I want
Riding 'round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
What I'm cooking in the kitchen, niggas
Bobby Brown, New Edition, niggas
What I'm wearing in this blizzard, nigga
Mink, leather or it's lizard, nigga
Saint Laurent, I'm in all layers
The mannequin to you ballplayers
Shout out my Mac 11 monster
Grew up on Nintendo playing Contra
And though that nigga only 5'9"
100 bodies on his timeline
What's the price of success?
Lost my bitch, bought a chef
The 911 cost 211
Watch looking like a jeweler's heaven
Hottest 7, I'm so alive
Your bank account Swiss, nigga, so is mine
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dopeboy quotable



It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna

Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I’m Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc's silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got him feeling like he’s Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit, I’m made of that
Cocaine parties like the 70's, I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing two bricks and trying to have a nigga strain it out the drainage

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Grew up watching momma car repo'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn’t there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I’m in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real nigga sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can’t ask why
Showing more love to bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Testarossa top models, G4s
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rosé bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it’s Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand ki's that I’m about to do Pilates on
Wear the king's crown like the grill a Maserati’s on
Catty corner parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans is pouring in

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos



I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit
If it comes down to it, ain’t no thang but to do it
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money, get fronted
One day you is the plug, next day you’re in the dumpster
Couldn’t keep it one hundred, you’re thirty-two percent
The police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch

Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain’t no arcade, nigga so quit playing
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain’t no arcade, nigga so quit playing!
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting

You don’t know about this life, nigga
Earning all of these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter Pans, pack holders on bikes, nigga
Throwin bitches on flights, nigga
They ain't know that they're dykes, nigga
'Til the money’s out and the bottle's pouring
They’re in the midst of they life, nigga
Rose gold on my wrist
This Rolex like Devil's piss
This Daytona illuminate
Y'all think I'm talking that devil shit
This's fifty racks, no bezel shit
Like blood diamonds, it’s rebel shit
This's more guns, this's more bodies
We call shots, they nobodies
They fuck niggas, they owe prolly
Who's fuckin with me? Nobody
When the guns drawn, they’re so sorry
Spraying niggas now the Lord got 'em
Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk
Fuck with my money and I’ll hit you that body work


Bad bitches on deck, nigga
Money, power, respect, nigga
Cop, cook, collect, nigga
You was never no threat, nigga
Everybody be rap dissin'
I catch niggas, I check niggas
These goons with me don't spit no verse
Just limo service, they stretch niggas
Black 'maro 2 S nigga
Couple birds on my neck, nigga
Everytime them hoes see me
They like, "Meek Milly you a mess, nigga"
2 gats, no vest, nigga
Strapped up like i’m a cowboy
Stand tall like that Yao boy
Got a bad bitch, she 5"4
This gold roley thats on my wrist
Leprechaun prolly die for
Young boys that's on my strip
They'll kill anything I say ride on
Tell them niggas call us if they're out of work
Cause we lifting weights but we don't do no body work


Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did
Know we love that KK sound
You know we not backing down
100 drum like, "Hold that doe"
Diamonds flash like Kodak, though
Straight cash, nigga fuck that loan
Seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my cuz on
Bitch I’m on fire, got my jaw wired
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch - Hurricane Irene




They call him a crack dealer, I am like Warhol
A nigga paint a picture of a bullet for all y’all
Now crawl for him
My sophomore jinx is more minks
But only for my mother she’ll use ‘em as couch covers
You niggas cheapening my All-Star Weekends
If y’all can’t swim in the deep end then watch nigga
Woo! 80,000 on this watch niggas
Yuugh! And I ain’t never had to watch nigga
Rich or wealthy, pick your poison
I think I paid for one too many abortions 
Another Celine, it’s like a routine
It’s like ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans
Her new body's in my new body
Make her in an hourglass that’s my new hobby
Rich nigga shit, how I blew my first million
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin

Talk numbers, but never talk ‘em to me though
When you’re the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain’t talkin’ to me though

The Robb Report of the snort
Kings hold court
Lawyers get bought
Palms get greased when them cases get fought
No felony what the fuck is you tellin’ me
Reduced to simple assault
It cost to keep it hush-hush
It was just us
Ended up sellin’ my Bat Mobile
The crash don’t kill
It’s how you survives it
Rebound on niggas, I nine live’d it
Couldn’t miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun
Bitches ain’t respecting niggas not in full bloom
So the neck is full moon
I’m living a lie, she live for this life
And loving the Alaia pumps
Loving the rush, I’m living “The Wire” Uh
Drugs and this rap is really “Empire”
Rich nigga shit, how I lost my second million
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin ya

Talk numbers, but never talk ‘em to me though
When you’re the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain’t talkin’ to me though

Ten toes deep in the trap, nigga I’m good here
Feelin’ like Tony reading words on the Goodyear
Big said, “Only the FEDs I should fear”
So no threat, be on your steps with the whole hood there
Yeah, shoot up shit then we blow the scene
Kerosene in a 20 ounce Poland Spring
Nothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona
It’s homicide when I slide up on ya
Reporting live from the project benches
Hella caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes 
Heron zombies street-walking on three-week binges
Clientele look like the “Thriller” vid in 3D lenses
COD, niggas never had to front me jawns
I’m weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on
I’m Nino Brown in the projects
Yes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex
Get rich or die tryin’ is my mindset
And spend it all until I’m swallowing dirt
Cause I ain’t never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse 
I ain’t never see a dead man taking the stand
I ain’t never see a nigga swallow a bullet 
And live to talk about it
'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it
You watched me go through hell, now watch me walk up out it
Nigga shit, that’s how I lost three million
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin ya



I hope you pussy muthafuckas die
Wish death upon they soul until they burnin' in a fire
I'm the illest mothafucka breathin', fuck yo rhyme or yo reason
Fucking over yo issues, it's kill-a-ho-nigga season
I made my way, way, I found my road, road
Bar-arada-da, I made my own, ho
YUGHHH , you ain’t ever have shit local nigga?
Woo, how the fuck I owe you local niggas?
I’m a global nigga, Champs-Élysées shopper
Looked up to Eric B and dope dealer, chain rockers
Where was you when I was bleeding
Disappointed and battling my demons
I just want to ride Italian leather, acting like you don’t know me
Euro designer palace, fuck my bitch on Missoni
And I feel…

And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life

It ain’t enough that I struggle through my career
Less appreciated when I was part of a pair
Pushed an envelope full of truth like I was dared
Depiction and the depth was the proof that I was there
It’s no question in my origins
Photo album full of Polaroids they’re still pointing in
Couple million records sold, still say I’m poisoning
Seven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar in
Brick by brick nigga, all you add is water in
We ain’t got to touch hands nigga, put your order in
I just want to float through clouds Hermes seams on my towels
No overly gaudy shit, just the diamonds on the dials
Woo, and I’m still buying mo’ guns
Mo’ money, mo’ murder nigga, choose one




They been trying to tie me to the BALCO
Too many clicks in the dial tone
I’m my city’s Willy Falcon
How you niggas celebrating Alpo?
I’m disgusted
Interior rustic, the mustard-colored wall’s adjusted
Trap doors everywhere
Macs come out the floor, dinners at the Forge
Four Seasons all four seasons
It’s good to have a getaway for no reason
Concierge never speak
‘Cause this week look like last week
They both named Ashley
I might travel to El Barrio
To get it from Daddy-O then adios
Cellphone at the back patio
I didn’t have to make a cameo to get it off

I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA

Yuugh! Pops up like dandruff
Beverly Hills Jed Clampett
A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I’m at your door
You don’t wanna know him if you owe him
I done boxed in cars and had to tow ‘em
I done laid in lawns when they didn’t mow ‘em
Even hogtied wives, I had to show ‘em
That I mean business
I mean everything I say, no witness
No forgiveness, Souls of Mischief 
It’s on through infinity, my arms are endless
Your arms, too short to box with God
Might send a bitch a Elie Saab
She fucks and robs
10 grand just to touch the job
Close range, she don’t duck and dodge
You can’t trust them odds

I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA



Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy

Seeing is believin', believe when you see it
They saying I'm the best shit, I'm just trying to be it
They tied me to a mountain of it, I just try to ski it
Long distance wireless Kinect like I Wii it
Double-U double-I, spelled so you can see it
Cause it's way over their heads when I Ray Allen 3 it
I'm Rondo on the bongos when giving you my convo
We ain't been home since we were snatched out the Congo
Toast to progress as I'm staring out my condo
Made it this far and I ain't never been a Tonto
Yuh, as you compare me to a fuckin' rookie
You can't respect the new school when you played hookie
Cooked white, turned it tan, sold world Snooki
School of Hard Knocks, look at where the game took me
To the limit like Montana with better grammar
Bigger homes with bigger guns and better cameras


You are now listening to the future
Open your eyes, nigga, and see what I see
Don't mind me, I'm just here to restore the feeling
Yeah, I'm just here to restore the feeling
You feel the pressure, yeah

And an apron that hung from a kitchen nail
Straight from my memoirs as I kiss and tell
Big faces like Rushmore, touch more
Fashion trailblazers, trendsetters look to us for
The next mission when the tide dries up
With no innervision yet they eyes wide shut
Fifteen years abducting spies like us
Confidential informants disguised like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Accountant unscathed, millions is what they hid through him
Same principles you must adhere
Lohans get the breaks, the T.I.'s, we just steer through 'em


The odds is against us
No excuses though, we just play harder
Hustle smarter, yeah
They done freed Weezy
Congratulations my nigga
Now let TIP go, yuh

Get my chain, get my chain
This G.O.O.D. Music
You're sweet to me diabetes
Peace treaties
Breakfast of champions, they need Wheaties
Carrying the torch, the Olympic four rings
I'm a javelin throw from the crowning of the king
I hear em whisper like a hummingbird sings
Of all the trust issues that a hundred birds bring
Now the wolves out hunting for your bling
You're preying on the bitches with the lowest self esteem
It's a common running theme
Victim or vice lord
Disciple or Black stone, what you look to Christ for
We in the last days, fire or the ice storm
I wear it in my chain as a symbol of a crime lord
Let's be honest, the cards on the table
Jealousy's a sin, Cain killed Abel
Backstabber, Caesar had Brutus
It's hard to weed 'em out, even Jesus had Judas
Gone



The flow plays limbo courtesy of Timbo
Strip it down nigga, Jim Joe
I build it better nigga ten fold
La Ferrari from the Enzo
The stencil inspired by Kenzo
The roof is like Ghostface, can it be so simple
40 keys in a rental
My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel
I keep cash, case Feds connect me
Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
Not concerned with your rap beef
Poetic justice watching you sock puppets
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Thou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget 
I bury 2 mil in the Caymans they can’t touch it

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Trap phone, gun at your backbone
Graduated from the corner where the crack’s thrown
Back talk to your momma now you act grown
Listening to Young Dolph till the pack gone
I relate to ‘em
I’m a Pyrex God, shit I’m great to ‘em
All of you lil’ niggas quote all of the wrong figures
Poke all of the wrong bitches
And follow the wrong niggas
Whichever rapper hot at the moment
Don’t realize he a candle till he blow it
I gave y’all the game it’s decoded
The only thing left is to grow it
Drop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two
It’s all hustlin’, so deja vu
Still a nigga unwrap bricks
I’ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Game too emo, I’m too Nino
Must stay low-key, I play Reno
I’m so Pesci, too Casino 
We Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos
Outlandish, so illegal
So Carlito, so Pacino
We sip vino, the grapes of wrath
Money counter go till it breaks in half
Coupes the flagship, it feels like futon
Palm the paddle shift, abuse the redline
The home is ranch style, reflects the poolside
Powder paved the way, the sword got two sides
Duffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5
Mules are flying in, the drive from Tucson
The dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line
Connect is in Panama, in bed with the cruise lines

Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it




Heavy is the head that wears the crown
These niggas heads is too light
Put the Fear of God in these niggas, Pusha

It's like the changing of the guards
We changing out the frauds
I gave these lions heart like my name ended in Oz
Long time coming, Sam Cooking up these bars
Push a ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
I'm Buddy Lee so lucky me, see I’m home
Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm
So as I embark, this where begin start
I write my own happy ending, nigga pen sharp
My life’s a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it
The Penthouse’s bed needs a crane for it
I'm fuckin on it, exotic bitch from out the rainforest
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I'll be damned if I let Yale campus vilify
As I uplift this art form ceiling high
I can't identify, with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin' one breath
Outsiders looking in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg
Then guns shots going off that’ll awake the dead
Push!



Now that you’re focused 
I’m glad that you noticed
The realest nigga here
It’s kinda chilly being the coldest
Me and Timbo in that two-door, making our ”Otis"
Now witness the chosen
It’s just different here
Monte Carlo nights, let her throw the dice
Play in paradise
All I know is white
Get the powder gone
Bitches love to shop, levitate the mall
Mattress full of money, let it break the fall
Woo! She used to fly on a buddy pass
They say when the money go, you hope that your honey last
I been preaching since money, cash— hoes

And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it’s so hard to see you
Got money I’ve been different ever since
Maybe it’s me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don’t know you
Who are you? We don’t know you

I’m the fire and the base
I’m admired by the greats
This to each and every rap nigga
I look you liars in the face
Cold case, Rolls Wraith 
Big dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars
See the jewelry, all rock, no guitar 
Who you know better with the raw?
Bogota, she like finessing niggas
She gets a Range Rover Sport 
And got seats on the court from the best of niggas
I never bit at that apple
I never lost my El Chapo
I can still grab it, and bag it and capsule 
Covered in white like I walked in the chapel
I’m that cold

And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it’s so hard to see you
Got money I’ve been different ever since
Maybe it’s me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don’t know you
Who are you? We don’t know you

The last dope dealer
Red leather in a room full of Thrillers
The mamas, they zombies
Chase a nigga for the money, they behind me
Woo, safe look like it got a printer
Ain’t no rappers in that Sprinter
Ain’t no saints, only sinners
What bitch ain’t fucked a winner?
I’m a blue ribbon nigga
Talk down on you two pigeon niggas
Front five or better
Yeah, I got a mountain of it, you could climb forever



I’m only in the company of kings
I made a power move and it’s everything it seems
Before Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Standing on the shoulders of 20 thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F-B-I-R-S-D-E-A
One letter short but still muthafuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try to crack the code
Combination locks to the kilo’s that I hold
Leopard print Louboutins prowling the concrete
Rollerballs come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me, Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any of them top floors
35 large, took it right out the top drawer
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock draw

It’s like raid, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream

You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered Jelly donuts to taking them Os
From my high school sweetheart to fucking more hoes
Look I’m all grown up and I dun blown up
Nigga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same
I’m the definition of shooter, gun of choice the Ruger
You’ll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I’m a magnet to murder, when I’m in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I’m bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I’m filthy
Drop Phantom is milky, white on white
24 inch blades, I'm skatin', red eyes
Smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
50 back running round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire


I sit with the liars, duck tape and tiers
Been lost their soul, they just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shit load of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price, man that ship sailed
Take a breath and head back if that shit failed
Drop weight like an anchor then you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine devil scream when I turn the key over
Pirelli's on the street rolling like a steam roller
Bitches double team when I have my sleepovers
Yeah, Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit
This is tailor-made drug dealer theme music
Test it on your tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it




Big up di numba one awtist inna di rap game, Pusha T
Me waa unnu kno seh nuhbody nah fuck wid da bwoy yah in or outta music
Di money nah stop run
Nuhbody nuh ave di lyrics, nuh body nuh ave di style or fashion weh him have
Fi him program sort out differnt from unnu
Unnu a rampin business, caa who?
When him touch mike everybody haffi puddung an run weh

The dead has arisen
My niggas still in prison, though
Til they free, none's forgiven
It's only one mission, it's only one magician
All-Star's in Houston this year, I'm still fishin'
The plug's playground where them hoes play around
Galleria, Mr. Trick Bag when I'm in town
That's the energy I'm missin'
A thousand drug dealers with the cruelest intentions
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord
I'm Kobe goin' for his sixth ring, while that church choir sing
I'mma lean 'til they crown me king of New Orleans
Now everybody so 80's, 90's-inspired
But none of you niggas 80's and 90's rhymin'
You laptop hot, just internet warm
Fuck nigga, you just internet porn
Now we don't gotta fake it no more, the line's drawn
I'm too much dope dealer for rap niggas
Too much closer to every trap nigga
I'm just preachin' facts, nigga
I'm more biased to the coke-dealin' Coupe drivers
And bad bitches steered wrong by they loose mamas
It's the wrath of the caine
Preludes the debut, My Name Is My Name

My name is my name!
My name is my name!



Ay yo, they said it's 10 points higher up there
We got to go get that

Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough

One man cowboy, speed limit timid
Chevy Malibu; we graduated from them renteds
Lost 100 large on the last time we sent it
Travelin' the distance, stayin' off the white line
Alphabet boys out prayin' what they might find
I hate the Carolinas, racial profiler
Say you smokin' marijuanas, fuck you talkin 'bout
My piss is clearer than my mama's, with her church wig on
996 before I get my Big on
Thousand grams, thousand hands, thousand furs, thousand bands
Hundred thousand dollar horse all-star; we stylin' in


You niggas ain't takin' road trips for real
Route 13 with the vacuum seal
Pre-paid Legal on my window shield
The ice cream man's on his Jack & Jill
Moving weight state to state; MACK trucks I deal, MACK trucks I fill
I feel better knowin' that the donor is anonymous
See, my diamond is growin'
Tugboat or car tow, we summertime snowin'
Reasonable Doubt flowin' on your niggas
Been gettin' it since '96 in black AC Vigors
Snub .38 with the matte black trigger
When How Can I Be Down was filled with crack niggas





This track dictates everything I'm supposed to say
So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's cliche the devil had a hold of me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't put the blow away
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
Hoping to land their ass on all top 5 lists
I wish you niggas well, you niggas wish I fail
You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
Squeeze off on him, leave cross on him
By the time the bodies found there's peat moss on him
I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
My drug ring's a multi-million dollar crime wave
Two ranch homes, both dockside
Get this money back, counter-clockwise
Little bubble on the cut like peroxide
The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide

I ask forgiveness lord, in hopes of getting more
Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for
I wasn't crazy poor, see I was lazy more
A thousand kilos cross his lines that you can't ignore
I felt entitled to it, not how the bible do it
My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
I just took a page, then I took the stage
Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
I tried to tame the beast, best I could no leash
I stood the test of time, air-tight no leaks
Not a squeak not a peep of a word
I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
Have mercy on me, they put curses on me
I could've been six feet or had nurses on me
It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me
I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me

I am forgiven
You don't do all the shit that I done and make it through and not be forgiven
This is the Wrath of Caine motherfuckers
Let this hold you over
It's just an appetizer
Ha Ha!
My Name is My name coming soon
Re-Up Gang Forever
GOOD Music
Dope boys worldwide
My Name is My Name



I’m feelin myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I’ma tell them that they can get lost
Cause I’m feelin myself, it’s my world
I’m spending money like a rich white girl
I’m gon' ball like I’m 7 feet tall
I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself

Oh, what a feelin, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my Nino, smelling like a kilo
But I’m downy fresh soft white like my pillow
Feelin myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself


Baby take your chance, never mind what you’re hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell them what you’re wearing
Shop 'til you drop they say sharing is caring
More than my winnings, we can share opinions
Like baby steps, we can share beginnings
Walk before you run, but she so independent
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal or No Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself


I propose a toast to every living kingpin
Smart enough to delegate their work to their wing man
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Play my cards right, now I’m looking at a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it, you can call me Smoking Ace
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself




I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I’m just asking you to listen
I’m living in a World, where my truth can be my lynching
Last words “fuck you all” feel the ropes tension
I’ll never compromise, in it 'til the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in their honor, there legacy’s in bottles
Make them walk like their 30 years is right around the corner
We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her
I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha
Yeah, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, that's little Dent money
The AC is forever broke, that's vent money
Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Always thinking big now they praying for downfall

Say you telling on me, told them folks bout me
All this coke round me like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around
I just bought the house, put the pent on it
No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around

Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view
Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Now I’m standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit’ll drive you crazy, it done drove Shyne Jew
Mazel tov, now I’m hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scalp the coupe like a tomahawk
Travelodge stories, I pray that you ignore me
If you can’t feel the joy off a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
ATL, Glenridge, condo’s true story
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
Weed the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts like it’s Peter Pan




From Virginia, never rated
Before us, no one ever made it
Dope boy lane, a nigga paved it
When every nigga was afraid to say it
Sold a mill, spent a mill
We was grindin', Lord's will
Never thought of hiatus
Only chains, hi haters
All these bitches, high maintenance
But I love it though, I cater
Deal fell, Tony saved us
After blowing up, Al Qaeda
Feds rushed like Raiders
Took our coach down, Al Davis
Regroup, tears faded
Casket Drop a year later
Three albums, three majors
Only critics to our favor
Crew members turned traitors
Put the spin on it, tornados
Our father, thy neighbor
Couldn't tell me that God hate us
I was lost, I was jaded
Malice found his way to our savior
Now author, he offers
Way to view it 'fore I see coffins
Way to view it 'fore we see vultures
Different way to view it, for the culture
Ross called 'em, Ye and all them
In Hawaii, Jay and all them
I was honored to be called in
Ran away with it, "So Appalled" them
New catalog gonna hurt you
Go on it, it's dark like it's curfew
Goin' in the vault, it will earth you
I'm back in with P, it's full circle



Prometh flow for the slow sippers
And if you on your paper chasing, I’ma roll with ya
About an onion, it odors a bag of Funyuns
Bitches packaging dozens, fuck ‘em until they malfunction
I laugh my ass off, taking shots like a gunman
I don’t hunt game, motherfucker, I hunt men
Take ‘em to the back of my pick-up truck to rot them
Kill a fuckin’ superhero, I watch the Watchmen
I’m a super-negro, my watch the rocks in
My Glock that’s cocked, loaded, and ready to lock in
Who’s sending niggas to the dirt? Ostriches
Captain holding them captive fucking hostages
Create carnage from cartridges, eating the heart of pigs
To murder, homicide’s a part to live with that
Grab your Teflon, ammunition, and your gat
Unless you wanna get shitted on like porn scat

Oooh, you ain’t sayin’ nada
Guns drawn, niggas scream opera
38 snub or the chopper
Middle finger goes to the coppers
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh, you ain’t sayin’ nada
Guns drawn, niggas scream, opera
38 snub or the chopper
Middle finger goes to the coppers
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh

Hey Hodgy, hey Tyler, don’t mind us
In all black Versace dressed in the finest)
We sell it all, even the drugs are designers
Gangsta bitches, Red Monkeys for the ecstasy
Let them hoes show they true colors-) crew lovers
Two brothers, add two others just the news of it
Make the net crash, the ultimate “Who done it?”
But she was knocking down Glen Rice)
Been nice since the Wolf Gang was baby pups
Add two dope boys known for taping up


Spit bars, this hard, teen sixteen bars
I’m fucking the game when its vagina got my dick scarred
Um, sure it’s ‘Preme button up floral
Stack of money, dark shades, looking like a fucking tourist
Or it’s the Tourettes that my fucking neck have
I’m like a average nigga in the 20’s of the 18’s
And I’m not even 20, dropped a classic at my 18
The wolves finally reconcile
At Interscope office with a bunch of fucking pedophiles
While mouth watering, this shit is sick and fucking vile
Trying to fuck my destiny, they couldn’t find another child



Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi
Recorded in Emirate's palace
I bring to you the Fear of God
Liva Don, Noah on the boards, Steven Victor on the camera, Virgil what up

They say this took confidence, I just call it patience
Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence
Knowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds, see the judge tryna' Pac me
Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee
Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train
Mike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya
These rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers
Now it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up
Planetarium Push, the I-Max experience
They say I talk coke for 9 years long
That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong
You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone
But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yeah, see my verses let you tag along
Swim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon
Three bitches, three different flights
Glad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights
As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice
You can't just rap this, the same mindset
That had me hide it in the mattress, now got me round the atlas
Wish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this
They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter

Can I live
You tell me, can I live

















No flex zone, No flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, No flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal
And a gold bezel
I treat it so special
Now your ho jealous
Freak Hoes, got several
They tens or better
I'm a trendsetter
I'm a go-getter

Who ain't waiting on King Push?
Got niggas checking for them new flows
Sold more dope than the old Jigga
Now niggas calling me the new Hov
Let the coupe go, planetarium
Let the roof go like Cesarean
Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga
Just a hunnid bottles they carrying
Cross the border like I lost a daughter
This foreign nigga, he ain't know better
Him pick and choose where them bullets fly
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas
Still killin' haters, God bless em'




Ayo French
You, you know I'm bout that life right?
Pusha!

Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat, it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin'
For every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin'
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and a tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines
The new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer


I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone
They're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone
Or you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome
Took a brick and I turned it to stone
5 into 10, the Return of the Clones
Then I took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Loss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed
Few still reminiscin' in they CL
Selling Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V-12




Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed us to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searching through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I have both mine home, let's keep it real niggas
My better half chose a better path, applaud him
Younger brother - me, a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like Autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I'll claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard, the rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's Heaven for a hustla, no graveyards
Cause stand up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix it with the powder, sell it to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it out the plastic
Now you celebrate, muthafuckas raise your glasses
PUSH!!!



I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favour like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream


Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last


See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
Let your hair down, I don’t have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin




If you got a whip outside right now
And you really about that life
Put your keys in the air right now, damn

That Louie and my cologne when I'm riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Riding in that Lambo, riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Oh my God I'm in this ho
Oh my God I'm in this ho
Oh my God I'm, oh my God I'm
Oh my God I'm in this ho
In this ho, I'm in this ho
That Louie and my cologne when I'm riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo

Woah, I'm pulling up in that shit
Four fifty eight on that bitch
Doors lifting up on that shit
Ho, you see the shit on my wrist
Oh my God I'm in this ho, oh my God I'm in this ho
Yeah I'm fucking that centerfold
Fuck you all in my business for
You ain't talking bout getting dough
You ain't talking bout getting more
Lakers - Heat, camera seats
That's the difference between rich and poor
Recognize I jeopardize that top spot and they testify
They ate first and I'm next in line
We back to back and he pass baton
I put my chest at that finish line
This art money, this Renaissance
My chain heavy, it's winter time
See all colors, this Benetton


Vroom, vroom, I ride around like wheels
Swizz, I'm back up on my shit
Haters, got to suck the dick
Ah, y'all can get them clips
I'm riding around in that Countach
Candy paint on that Countach
White seats on that Countach
Have you ever seen a Countach?
Rare form, I'm in rare action
Came back I'm like Michael Jackson
Woo! Michael Jackson
Wait a minute, let me slow it down
For you dumb niggas I'll slow it down
I gets the paper you know it now
I gets the paper you know it now
Damn, damn, I just crashed it
But I'm 'bout to get another one, you little bastards

Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

Started with 28 grams and a hammer
Bitch look at me now, I'm Tony Montana
Gave me 2 options, hell or the slammer
They forgot the third, I’m on top, antenna
Winter time, bags at the mall, bad Santa
Fifths plaza, Lennox Square Mall, Atlanta
Twinkle toe, Louboutins, hoes love glamour
Black and white diamonds in the chain, that’s panda
Good Music calendar, Def Jam planner
Now everybody fans and the feds got cameras
Off white top on the coup like dandruff
Turn them k’s over white girls, that's Vanna
Sell him 10, front another 10, That’s standard
He asked to get fronted 20 more. That’s random
See the signs, cut the nigga short, That’s cancer
Kill him then kiss his mama﻿ cheek, That’s manners





They thought I lay dead, I was playing possom
Spot me everywhere with the 8 like Kate Goslin
Niggas think they sit at the top, they just posturing
Now they hide their head like an ostrich
Optimus Prime and that gull wing feeling like I transform
Niggas still hands on, whip it like a sandstorm
Had the audacity to sell it in a damn poem
Get you higher Angelo, the author of this anthems
Your punch lines are mere jabs, they see through
Like the clear glass on that coupe I steer past
Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault
You niggas is soft so on that pillow’s where you talk
Can’t find it in them d-list actresses on mattresses
Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them
Don’t you know that it’s money over bitches
Bitches love money, I granting them three wishes, Push

Shout out my nigga Don C, aka Givenchy Don C
Ya ain't even know that you got an aka did you?
Always in that fly shit, Mike Dean what up? Brendan
Or should I say international Brendan? Marcus Paul? Refresh, yeah
The fear of Gods in these motherfuckers
You can act like don’t hear this shit man
Niggas ain’t fucking with me man, no games, yeah



I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
And tatted up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because I have the speakers going hammer

Back up in this bitch niggas free to go
It was all good just a key ago
Price for the 20 all I need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
Detroit's hard, while I Cape Cod
You niggas Lil B's to the Based God
I been cooking, is you mistooken?
Chi town plug got the city jukin'
Givenchy motorcycle leathers
Mad Max, 5 stacks for a look this weathered
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mixed ones whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curb when I'm done with 'em
She oblivious her girl wanna come with 'em
Can't blame her; other niggas can't run with 'em
Usain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with 'em


So Liv
I picks her up, right?
This guy had a Range Rover just like you
I said Range Rover where? This ain't no motherfuckin Range Rover
This a G55; 130 thousand dollars of winter throwaway money
You must be out your fucking mind
See I could tell you ain't gonna be around long
You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on your nigga
Get it right




Yeah, King Push
Uh, Jeremih
You know we all about that money, right?
Well let's get paid

Paid! Paid!
Tryna get paid
Tryna get paid

You ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?
I'm tryna get paid
Fuck what they say
I don't need no faves
All I need is blue faces
Dead presidents, roll the same
Movin' up, George Jefferson
Shoppin' sprees, I know you've never been
All these niggas hate
Had to hit 'em with the wave
First class, talkin' 1A
First class, talkin' 1A

New money, uh, blue hunnids, uh
Cold winters, uh, cruel summers, uh
We winners, uh, the crew of us
It's nothin' better than livin' it with your brothers
New wheels on deck, no chill, we flex
New chicks, we sex, who's up? We next
It's a race 'til the finish line
'Til all my dogs eat like it's dinner time
We spend it on light toys, dodgin' them bike boys
Flippin' them pill packs, dodgin' them bike boys
We know the risk and the payoff
You only live once, so we never take a day off
Woo! Chop shops are the small change
Small gun with a long range
With the molly, made our own lane
We just here to get paid, we just tryna get paid

You ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?
I'm tryna get paid
Fuck what they say
I don't need no faves
All I need is blue faces
Dead presidents, roll the same
Movin' up, George Jefferson
Shoppin' sprees, I know you've never been
All these niggas hate
Had to hit 'em with the wave
First class, talkin' 1A
First class, talkin' 1A

Remember sleepin' on the rooftops?
Now what I'm drivin' out, a roof drops
No more skatin' through my tube socks
Young wild niggas like the Boondocks
The treasure's inside of the trunk
Help mama with the first of the month
Baby mama get to buy what she want
Baby sister get to buy the free lunch
It goes down when the poverty's up, woo!
See the difference is, had to get it, no privilege
Had to take it, no middle man
Just divided up the dividends
That's drug dealer discipline, that's how you reel 'em in
Woo! For that almighty dollar
I make the whole gang follow
The only way to pop bottles
You gotta have the money and the power
We just tryna get paid

You ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?
I'm tryna get paid
Fuck what they say
I don't need no faves
All I need is blue faces
Dead presidents, roll the same
Movin' up, George Jefferson
Shoppin' sprees, I know you've never been
All these niggas hate
Had to hit 'em with the wave
First class, talkin' 1A
First class, talkin' 1A



Since we on the topic, let me be obnoxious
Bitch that ain’t no paper, that shit fit in pockets
These Balenciagas, Philip Lim, the joggers
This ain’t just no style war, this right here is Shottas
Look at how these watches, hold these diamonds hostage
I just paid that ransom, stuntin’ on you biatches
We shoppers, you bloggers, if money talks, you mumblers
You try it on then take it off, then post a pic on yo Tumblrs
We tumblers, we acrobats, we jugglers
We flip that, it somersault, we get it back cuz we hustlers
It’s heatin’ up, we fired up like Waco
They place the order, we cross the border with pesos



In one short year, I've turned dreams to nightmares
Let the gods of the game know I'm right here
To you new muthafuckas, Buzz Lightyears
Ahead of y'all, so be careful on that tightrope
I inspire all the rappers that you might quote
Lookin' down on you niggas like white folk
You're entitled to believe all your high hopes
When you can fool anybody with the right hoax
Let you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em
With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em
Weakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em
I just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'?

It's so obvious; in my clothes you can smell it

Take a glimpse of my life as I walk through it
Powder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it
Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it
Hit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it
Music; I talk through it, it's an art to it
Let the critics praise, let the charts do it
As I burn through this money, no thought to it
80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it
I just shop through it; cook and chop to it
Move Heavy D; I should walk to it
We got our own thing; drop the top to it
This is block music; Wacka Flock to it


I'm so raw, runnin' from the law
A nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw
Here to raise the bar; chain, no flaws
Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
In that two-door, no rims on the car
The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw
See what I saw, the best getting better
Look, but can't touch; I'm a muthafuckin' leper
Q-dog steppa, Stomp The Yard better
K-I-L; I'm just waiting on a letter
Oh, there it is; let the triple beam measure
Re-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever




They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with her
Another bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Stron'jay
Yo hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bell grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
You couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

As I get hotter, haters get madder
Escalator up...fuck a ladder!
Success callin', your world's shattered
They say it's destiny; to me, it never mattered
Drug overlord, they put me over Lord
Say you gettin' money, we goin' overboard
New Years with my bitch in the Palm suite
Mink was like Ocho-Cinco with the blonde streak
The Don Dotta, the kingpin
I jump squares on you muthafuckas; king him
Lebron's on 'em, the coupe's Bond on 'em
The Aston was ice-blue, I went Tron on 'em
Now handle that, bitch, handle that
White dripping off the pot like candle wax
Let it dry then it's on to the next one
I'm Raekwon in the kitchen when I chef one

I'm light-years beyond Balenciaga pythons
You put 'em back after you try 'em on
I'm pushin' kilos; it's a pie-a-thon
Forklifting the palate, nigga, pile it on
Cocaine cowboys, no spurs, but I'm stylin' on
Every bird got my talons on
Run the Late Night, get my Jimmy Fallon on
I beat a different drum
G.O.O.D. Music, but I speak it with a different tongue
The numb one becomes number 1
See us Grammy night; bow ties and cummerbunds
Ciroc soak bad bitch, I'm layin' under one
Make her work for it, night nurse for it
In the morning she can get her heel and purse for it
Witch-doctor flow, you could say I'm cursed for it
The way I'm killin' shit, you should send a hearse for it
Push!



Only cause Dre say
Yeah, King Push on the way, yes

I made a million on a corner, sniff
I ain't even had to stand on it
Blue moon, I rides by, yes, but I fronted every gram on it
Real money ain't shy, no lay it out and get a tan on it
They say numbers don't lie, well dope boy, put your bands on it
Bet it nigga, protect Philipo, peasant niggas
Commonwealth, got the open foul
I'm the poster child for alleged dealers
These niggas mention my name
With their little rumors and their little jewelers
That's no threat, that's no sweat
My little shooters ride little scooters
Fuck you know about a motorcade full of millionaires
Hole in ones, we're like billionaires
Chain linked, they change colors, I'm Chamillionaire
This is sealskin walls, this is trap door floors
I charted nigga no borders nigga, we above those laws
I'm really running from the R.I.C.O
Yeah, I'm really dodging all them people
Uh huh, I run a marathon on the R.I.C.O
Y'all just waiting on the sequel

King Push on the Pharmacy
Beats One yeah



They think that they know, somethin' 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number, I just took her home with
Another bitch, menage, boomerang, estrange
Lipstick on my collar, oscar de le renta
You hijo pequeno, my nachos bel grande
Stay sippin that Andre, spend three stacks that's Andre
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim, they say I'm dressin' like Kanye
I'm everything my rhymes say, bread winner, brand owner, play clothes, millionaire, trend setter, land owner
Hope your bitch don't land on him, drink in his hand with the sand on em
You small niggas, you Hyundais,
Y'all couch niggas we stand on em
Big mu uh uh dope money with a band on it
Half gold, but got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same, just got a little bit of glam on it
DAM!




I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down time

I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night

I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night

Look at my situation, I couldn’t ask for more
I’m the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore
Look what that kilo sent me
That Porsche is key less entry
That girl is high and drunk, I swear the rest is elementary
We found a superfreak, no, she won’t know what hit her
I’m on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter
You’ve got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking
You don’t get good dick too often, I’mma have you funny walking
See that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off and
Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in
Back to that world you lost in

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

Black ambition, not
Blacks in prison, no
Lack a vision, lead to
Bad decisions, so
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch your number
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch it up
But the antidote
Might not exactly be in what you smoke
It might just be a letter from a long time ago
From someone you know
Who's been there before
So there you go

All the shit I've been through
On my third strike, I done sinned too
Got 'em in 18 or break
Best coke era, I done lived through
Rest in peace to real gold diggers
Might've fucked a whole crew of millionaires
Young bitches pick and choose wrong
Stuck with a baby, cry a million tears
I done had the realest nigga's bitch
I done seen the realest niggas snitch
Had some homies fresh outta prison
Get a job, seen the realest niggas switch
New ways, new days
401Ks, hoes love 'em
Whisperin', "The dope boy's dead"
Says the credit card, mothafuckas

Black ambition, not
Blacks in prison, no
Lack a vision, lead to
Bad decisions, so
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch your number
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch it up
But the antidote
Might not exactly be in what you smoke
It might just be a letter from a long time ago
From someone you know
Who's been there before
So there you go



I earned my name just like Marlo
Gripped every wheel at a Flex car show
I declare war, letting all you rappers know
Red light, yellow light, green light, go
Checkered flag shit, matching bag shit
Monaco Grand Prix snap back backwards
Don C joint with the python accents
The bitch still hissing, snake charmers magic
Some shit dont change, ya life ain't like mine
Missin' dope money sends chills up my spine
Closed the motorised blinds
Got a seal and a stamp, papi notarized mines
B.O. double S's, that Camaro ain't mine
That Phantom's double breasted
Got me feeling like Hov in that bubble Lexus
Back when Dame dropped the duffle off with the records
Yes!

I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself

Oh, what a feeling
The champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathing in millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my nino
Smelling like a kilo
But I'm downy fresh soft white like my Pinot
Feeling myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights
Middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself

Shop until you drop
They say sharing is caring
More than my winnings
We can share opinions
Like baby steps
We can share beginnings
Walk before you run but she so independent
And I could see us fly
The sky is the limit
We so real
Got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed
Watching Deal Or No Deal
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself

I propose a toast
To every living kingpin smart enough to delegate their work to their wing
Man, keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling and play my cards right
Now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yes, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it
You can call me smoking ace
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world



Know you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

You could bet that

If you be the cash
I'll be the rubberband
You be the match
Imma be your fuse
Boom!
Painter baby you
Could be the muse
I'm the reporter baby
You could be the news
Cause your the cigarette
And I'm the smoker
We raise a bet...
Cause your the joker
Truth tho...
You are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk
And I could be the walk
Yeaaah

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
Cuz this love is a sure thing

You could bet that

You could be the lover
I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt
You could be the lighter babe
Fire it up!
Writer babe
You could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby
You could be the note
Record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner

Prize, I'm a winner
And it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper baby
I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one
Cause you are ten
Real and not pretend!

Even when the sky comes fallin
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty lil hand in mine
Even when were down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it babe simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing

She my sure thing, my second only pure thing
It's like heaven when I'm untying them bra strings
See I'm drawn to her, horse and carriage like
Day dreaming got me thinking what is marriage like
She like Terrance Wright, I'm booking Paris Flights
The Hermes H bangles that I heard you like
Say the words and it's there
You put up with the rumours and they blog what you wear
His and her everything, charge for the pair
Couldn't let you cluster when I'm all solitaire's
Share and share alike, I never fear the price
Top of my game, I hope you ain't scared of heights
Roll a dice, you can bet that, never gotta sweat that
Pony hair, Louboutins let you pet that
Ferrari engine like the trunk got a jet pack
Looking pretty on my arms what you best at
PUSH!

Even when the sky comes fallin
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
This love is a sure thing

Know you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover



Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm just tryna find my way up out this f*cking kitchen
A Birdseye view got me channeling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands, all's forgiven
We kicking up dust like the Colosseum floors
Walls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet like she walking through my morgue
Grant's, Jackson's, no room for George
Yeah, the fear of God's in you motherf*ckers
This art imitate my life
Your WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice
My music's for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her bachelors
While my old bitch went back to get her Masters
Same graduation, I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts every time it's revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's Ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I'm free let's me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I'll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up, sipping java
Ey yo, strolling up the totem pole, what's my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bed my toddler?
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, watch how many niggas plans change
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a f*cking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in f*cking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that ya'll
I don't really give a f*ck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Uh, look, Uh uh
I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug-of-war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas night was f*cking awesome
But adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Loss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthaf*cking gorgeous, woah
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush did they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But they devil-red, tires double tread
I postin parks up, that gives me double head
Tight rope walking, tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind, look at what the devil did
Yuugh!





Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?
Just remember last year at this time
We were in a fucking cage, okay?
I'd like to forget that)
I say be happy with what you've got
Me, I want what's coming to me)
Oh, well what's coming to you?
And everything in it)















I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self-righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug-of-war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this pinata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed him
Trying to snatch my niggas back, I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the Four Horsemen
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tightrope walking, tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind, look at what the devil did

She left the door open, gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money, partied nights with the A-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading
So I write this alone in Vegas

They'll do everything in their power
Stomp me at the stove when you rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening the tower
It's 9-1-1, you're on your twenty-fifth hour
Hasta la vista, I'm stepping out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't go by just following the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede ya, yeah
Upgrade 'em, upstage 'em
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era, I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

Yeah, Fear of God niggas, got me feeling like 'Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know sit in New York for two days around Grammy winners?
Come back home straight to the money getters
About fourteen-thousand dollars worth in twenties
Brown paper bag money, yeah, I call that a good weekend
Haha, Re-Up Gang forever
"Long Live the 'Caine" coming soon
Malice my brother, I love you
Liva-Don, till the end nigga, yes
Remain well, hope I ain't get you in no trouble with that shit man
That was a long time ago, y'know? Haha
You know how we do
My nigga Nottz, you was blacking out on this beat my nigga
Yeah, come on
My nigga Watts, what up?
Young Young, what up my nigga? Talk that shit my nigga
Hey 'Ye, is you ready?
Is you ready nigga? I had to get this off my chest
Is you ready now though?
Let's go then, G.O.O.D. Music, yes

PUSH mutters numbers to himself. Thunder rumbles.











PUSH laughs and looks at screen. Screen displays two lion cubs pinning a goat.













I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I'm just asking you to listen
Last words "fuck you all" feel the ropes tension
I'll never compromise, in it til the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in they honor, there legacy's in bottles

We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her
Yeaugh, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, thats little dick money

Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Always thinking big now they praying for my downfall
Say you telling on me
Told them folks bout me
All this coke round me
Like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down
You know that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around

Put the pent on it
No rent couple can't hundred spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down
You that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around
Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view
Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Now I'm standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit'll drive you crazy, it done drove Shine's you
Yeaugh mazel tov, now I'm hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scout the coupe like a tomohawk
Travelodge stories
I pray that you ignore me
If you can't feel the joy of a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
We the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts
Like it's peter pan
Say you telling on me
Told them folks bout me
All this coke round me
Like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down
You know that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around
I just bought the house
Put the pent on it
No rent couple can't hundred spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down
You that I cook it down, cook it down
Everytime I come around



This track dictates everything I'm supposed to say
So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's cliché the devil had a hold of me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't put the blow away
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
Hoping to land their ass on all top 5 lists
I wish you niggas well, you niggas wish I fail
You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
Squeeze off on him, leave cross on him
By the time the bodies found there's peat moss on him
I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
My drug ring's a multi-million dollar crime wave
Two ranch homes, both dockside
Get this money back, counter-clockwise
Little bubble on the cut like peroxide
The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide
I ask forgiveness lord, in hopes of getting more
Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for
I wasn't crazy poor, see I was lazy more
A thousand kilos cross his lines that you can't ignore
I felt entitled to it, not how the bible do it
My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
I just took a page, then I took the stage
Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
I tried to tame the beast, best I could no leash
I stood the test of time, air-tight no leaks
Not a squeak not a peep of a word
I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
Have mercy on me, they put curses on me
I could've been six feet or had nurses on me
It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me
I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me
I am forgiven
You don't do all the shit that I done and make it through and not be forgiven
This is the Wrath of Caine motherfuckers
Let this hold you over
It's just an appetizer
Haha!
My Name Is My name coming soon
Re-Up Gang forever
G.O.O.D. Music
Dope boys worldwide
My Name Is My Name



I’mma show them how to whip it up for Ricky dia!

Scared money don’t make no money
If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
I’m on my northside Philly shit, southside furious
That boy and his bag and that boy is serious
Two chicks give me head on they periods
Make them run threesomes, ‘cus they a little curious
Scared money, they don’t make enough
You wanna go to war you don’t make enough
Have my niggas in your crib when you waking up…
They don’t want that type of beef so they wanna squash it
And fuck it I’m a rider
Magnum strapped tight, so I’m bustin’ all insider her
Nobody dies a virgin, life fucks us all
I was born poor, but was raised to ball
I’m a grown man, pay my own bills
Great Adventure money, I pay my own thrills

Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money don’t make no money
If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money don’t make no money
If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
Yeah
Scared money don’t make none
You ain’t really gotta ask where it came from
Caught fire with the brick, made a dollar off the strip
And went German engineering with my brake drums
Used to gamble with three dice, four fify six dream
Stayed up for three nights, with raw little fix fiend
Ran from the Po lights, thank God for the six speed
The slickest of bad bitches with good head that mislead
Sell it all nigga, then we ball nigga
If you scared then you better get a dog nigga
Panamera’s and we playing leap frog in em
If you get what you earn, we belong in em

If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
Have my nigga snatch yo bitch and rape yo honey
Goonie shoot up yo wheel you need May Gold money
As a youngin’ I used to be the lookout
Now we in the kitchen with pigeons having a cookout
Niggas gettin’ took in, niggas gettin’ took out
Used to drive Chargers now they foreign when I pullout
Maserati, Panamera’s, big Ghost’s
Team of killers, long clips, big toasters
Fuck around they buck you down, get chauffeured
Nice casket talking past’s, big hearses, ha!




I'm so bossy, b*tch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missing an S, n*gga
Your plane's missing a chef
The common thing see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side b*tches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-league, I'm like these clothes
'88 Jordan, leaping from the free throw
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
Twenty-five bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed twenty-five more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a b*tch live and say I bought her Michael Kors?
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, n*gga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
Thirty-six years of doing dirt like it's Earth Day, God
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards




The only thing missing is Seven Dwarfs
Funny snow white sprinkled off through my repertoire
Pissing the devil off, so much i shovel off
A nigga ice cold as I'm freezing my bezel off
They hopin' I level off

Escalator climb on you niggas
I only speak money, I go mime on you niggas
White cloves and a powder face
Single air ?drazer? gym stars on powder plates
The winter coupe hibernates, here's where i dominate
The longest running trapstar street niggas nominate

Over-all
Although watches get overhauled, bitches get over dogged
Can't limit the protocol, don't turn your motors off cause niggas motives is on
They say the snake is the closest Remember to mow the lawn

Rich Nigga shit!!!



It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna
Sleeping with the finest
The thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got em feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack
Yeah, talk money, I'm made of that
Cocaine parties like the 70s, I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing 2 bricks and have a nigga try to strain it out the drainage
See my face on the news and it ain't TiVo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the RICO
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
Grew up watching momma car repoed
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope a real nigga sell yayo
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Show em all love, the bitches f*cked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work
Testarossa top models, G4s, Gucci pass the crease off
Everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder fall, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win
Celebration spills through the morning like an Ambien
Bitches love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilates on
Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper, blew a fuse and caught a body on
Cocaine storaging, Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in





What do you want fucko? You want something?
L swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead
Don't shoot

All I see is
Black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil's angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my shine into Moses
Couldn't cleanse my soul with them civil rights' hoses
Panoramic roof under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Kilian loafers
Photo op is priceless, frame my wanted posters
War brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
I ordered hits, She orders Mahi



I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I’m drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what’s inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that’s one saga
One chapter of black magic, I’m Harold Potter
Feels like I’m doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won’t allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss ‘em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed ‘em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I’m motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel’s kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did

She left the door open gave a fuck if I’m famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I’m the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

They’ll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you’re rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It’s 911 you’re on your 25th hour
Asta la vista I’m steppin’ out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil’s now the teacher
The game can’t go by just followin’ the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

Fear of God niggas, got me feelin’ like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters
About $14,000 dollars worth in 20s
Brown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Long live the caine coming soon
Malice my brother I love you
Liva Don ’til the end nigga



The nerve of you, he'll sit and clip at your lines
Like he ain't heard of you
I seen it happen before, that man will murder you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
Tiptoe-in but the whole while clonin'
The elephant's in the room, the b*tch glowin'
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn-in
She walk like its hers but the whole world knowin'

Told n*ggas it's the new god flow
It's that new testament and that old god knows
And you new n*ggas don't get to pass GO
I'll monopolize boardwalk empire flow
So don't mention me in the same breath, I'm Genghis
Just venting I never wish to be famous
Truth told I'd much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin' n*ggas to angels
Local n*ggas hatin' but I can't blame 'em
Cleared the road to the riches but I can't pave 'em
Put Trey up on your hook, still couldn't save 'em
Better chance with a snowball hittin' Satan

Dreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now I'm back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthaf*ckers thought I would barely survive

Rappers on their sophomores, actin' like they boss lords
Fame's such a funny thing for sure
When n*ggas start believing all those encores
I'm just the one to send you off, bonjour
See yourself as I pull up in that mirror tint
Skins vs blouses, you mirror Prince
Chappelle Show, all of your Neal Brennans
Sketch comedy, who is for real penning?
The talk don't match the leather
The swag don't match the sweaters
And wolves don't walk with shepherds
These Margiela verses all of you mall dwellers
Off-the-rack suits looking like pallbearers
Coffins for my old b*tches' orphans
Daddy's MIA like a dolphin
Play the Fendi bucket like a sharks fin
Cool J-ing on you b*tches but I'm dark-skinned
We walked in, seats courtside, dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk by
At the US Open, there's much more to Queens
Versace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene

Dreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now I'm back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthaf*ckers thought I would hardly survive

Push, no shots, but nothing goes unseen

Liva living dreams, ya DeLoreans pouring in




Two-door, four-door, sedan, roadster
Cabriolet convertible, careening in the coaster
Christian Louboutin, straps is like a holster
We balling — ESPN highlights, posters
Tangerine Lambos, mimosa, raise a toast
We at the Grammys, then Miami
Playing Boca like it’s poker
Had a room at the La Quinta
Full of soldiers, full of coca
Feel a ulcer
Hundred grand up in the sofa, reupholstered
I am twisted
Saying Heath Ledger Joker to you jokers
If you Tony, I hang up, send a hit, I am Sosa
I am cultured, I am legend
I am Liva, I am closer
To the best writer alive
Other two, I’m the closest
No holsters, no chauffeurs
No mask, no witness
No corpus, no guts, no glory, no joking
All-Star we play
C-I-two A
And 2 Chainz, with my bad bitch — it’s my b-day
This life that we live is for the connaisseurs
Carnival, gives our form
Everyday pool side cabana floss
Mami in Monolos, I’m in that Gucci polo
With the multi color moving dolo on my solo
My niggas that’s in prison I’m their eyes and their ears
Every champagne night, for every laugh there’s a tear
There’s a picture being shown, every jail every tear
Representing so my niggas know I’m here
Poloroids being shown in every jail, every tear
Representing all my niggas know I shared from the heart



I wake up, early in the morning
Around the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup? wassup?
And ...tad it up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because i have the speakers going hammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
The dough boy version yeah
Back up in this bitch niggers free to go
It was all good just a key ago
Price for the 20 all i need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
Detroit's hard, while I Cape Cod
You niggers little bees to the base guard
I've been cooking, is you mistooking?
Shot town plug got the city junking
Jivon she motorcycle leathers
Mad max 5 stacks before i look this weather
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mix 1 whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curve when i'm done with them
She oblivious a girl wanna come with them
Can't blame off another niggers can't run with them
Husein bolt through these bitches then i'm done with them
I wake up, early in the morning
Around the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup? wassup?
And ...tad it up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because i have the speakers going hammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
The dough boy version yeah
See i could tell you ain't gonna be around long
You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on you nigga
Get it right



Let's go
Uh, the drop-top specialist
Yes, we turn heads like an exorcist
These red bottoms on our feet looking devilish
We take it to the next level, so effortless

I'm tired of you kicking the dirt, just want the dust to settle
I'll find just what I deserve, if you can't do better
Can't say that you'll take your time, before the sweet turns sour
You changed right before my eyes, you picked the wrong flower

Don't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Oh, what do you take me for

Boy now that the tables have turned, don't let me see you begging
It's a hard life lesson to learn, when it's me you're not getting
So low but you're all alone, and now you got no power
Let go cause I'm cutting the rope, I guess you climbed the wrong tower

Don't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Two kids in a bucket, f*ck it
The way you handle this
Yeah I'm disgusted
Never been busted, treat me like a suspect
Why am I the one that just can't be trusted
Try harder, discuss it, why bother
I made you, I'll make another and she'll go further
And you can bet a million on it
South of France on a yacht with us chillin' on it

Don't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
What do you take me for, what do you take me for



I'm feelin myself, Pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feelin myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about ya'll, but I'm a get off, cause I'm feelin myself

Oh, what a feelin, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car was a?
Still up on my nino, smelling like a kilo
But I'm down and fresh soft white like my pillow
Feelin myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin myself

I'm feelin myself, Pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feelin myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about ya'll, but I'm a get off, cause I'm feelin myself

Baby take your chance, never mind what you're hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell them what you're wearing
Shop till you drop they say sharing is caring
More's in my winnings, we can share opinions, like baby steps
We can share beginnings, walk before you run, but she so independent
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal no Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin myself

I'm feelin myself, Pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feelin myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about ya'll, but I'm a get off, cause I'm feelin myself

I propose a toast to every living kingpin
Smart enough to deligate their work to their wing man
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it, you can call me smoking ace
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin myself

I'm feelin myself, Pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feelin myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about ya'll, but I'm a get off, cause I'm feelin myself



Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the God of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the Yay' as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four door
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
Step on they necks 'til they can't breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
Im ballin', Amar'e
A nick' sold in the park then I want in
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But these Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's
'Cause we can't get along, no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aw man, made something from nothing
Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to, I'm from the 3 1 2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!



You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit that y'all wanted
This shit cook up hard, don't it?
Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, ah!


I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit


This that shit y'all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch, I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches


This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it



The only thing missin' is seven dwarves
Funny, Snow White sprinkled all through my repertoire
Pissin' the devil off so much I shovel off
A nigga ice-cold as I'm freezin' my bezel off
They hopin' I level off, escalator-climb on you niggas
I only speak money, I go mime on you niggas
Uh, white gloves and a powdered face
Single-edge razor, Gemstars on powdered plates
The winter coupe hibernates, here's where I dominate
The longest runnin' trap star street niggas nominate over all
All the watches get overhauled
Bitches get over, dog, can't limit the protocol
Don't turn your motors off 'cause niggas' motives are on
They say the snake is the closest, remember to mow the lawn
Rich nigga shit



And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know

Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit

See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find, Yeah, I always find, Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know

Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away

...I get crazy
Just run away
...I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away

Man i'm about to get crazy
Why can't she just run away?
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move
You could leave or live wit' it

Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off

Hoes like vultures, they wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes wit' a price tag, baby, face it

You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me

I'm guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find, Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know

Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can



I've been on the road
But now I'm back again
And this time
I brought my little friend
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight

You mean the most to me in this world
I've been thinking to myself a lot
You probably think it's my girls
But when you got the love
It's not like you ain't calling home
And the conclusion I came to is, baby, I am going
Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends
And I'm starting a new life
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight

Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Ooh, you should think about what you did wrong
If you love me
Ooh, such a pity I had to write this song
Better luck with your next girlfriend
Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends, we're hanging out
And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight

Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Pusha, I'm finally back at you two years later, hiatus was hell
300 K thanks to digital scales
Eggshell whites, had them boys on my tail
The truth out, now you don't have to question what I sell
Far as the fucking flow, I'm the hottest 'round
Tap your girl, Ma, ask her how this sound
Condos, fast cars, that's Miami heat
If you know they just copped Shaq, we got the floor seats
Whachu talkin' 'bout? All that hair and all that wear
BAPE, BBC, Three Dots and all that there
I spent green mayne on that bling chain
Make you scream like the silly nigga from Ying Yang
As God is my witness, my fist does clenched this
Green like fist of big Grinch Stole Christmas
Re-up time and it's the work that we bringing out
Hot off the wire, Faith tell 'em whachu thinking 'bout
Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends, we're hanging out
And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight



It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

Two sides, what the game'll do
Bring money, fame to you
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Standin' on it like a pedestal
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the pool house you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, went ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'


Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know




You know what happens when G. O. O. D. Music and mmg get together right?
We get that money

Millions, Millions in the ceiling
Millions, Millions in the ceiling
Millions, Millions in the ceiling
Millions, Millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

This that shit that ya’ll wanted?
This shit cook up hard don't it?
Yall gotta beg my pardon on it
I'm tired and yall gotta pay your ties
Call my Phantom the Holy Ghost
Church on chrome wheel tires
Pop a tags when I'm paranoid
Cause a pawn shop was my paradise
I was there pop when that powder came
For that not safe in that shoe box
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face and blue-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks

I restore the feeling of when niggas made a killin’
Hiding choppers in the closet half a million in the ceiling
And them niggas with angel faces cryin’ out with I'll intentions
And just so I can buy them Christians have em fuck it on all their bitches ah!


I'm honored by horror stories, wanna be home owners
Horrible outcome with the boy got one motive
Prize when he conficted, pride on every visit
I'm crying sayin his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my fingers, until I found me a fortune
Finger fuckin Ferrari’s, South of France early mornin
Get drunk with Donatello, Versace, my Acapella
Never see me in Neimans, nigga commiting treason
Soft loafer prefered, frost organic herb
Stay away from the forbes of our only can tell you more
I got this I got that
I got that, I got this
Got a kilo for twenty
My niggas say I'm the shit


This that shit ya’ll ask for
Make a nigga on the gas floor
2- door, 4-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward, Oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sells ain't much as theirs and we still ridin same coupes
How we still fuckin same hoe?
How we still buy the same clothes?
How we both got the same watch?
I’m just keepin ya’ll on your toes
Dope boys, gold mind
That price drop and that Coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang to dry like clothes line

I restore the feeling of when niggas made a killin’
Hiding choppers in the closet half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter Arm-N- Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin all your bitches, aaah!







Snippets from the Pusha T x ADIDAS collaboration "Bodega Babies"

Black child born in the storm
They had to bundle up to stay warm
Bodega babies

Bodega babies
You wonder why these kids of the 90s crazy?

Child rebel soldiers of the inner city
The hate me now tigers next to Nas and Diddy
His mama fell in love with drug dealing, did he?
The only star left though is next to Biggie

Little did she know she was one of four
With the same mean mug that was born from hate

Bodega babies
Yeah, bodega babies
How loud I got to scream for someone to save me?
Yeah, bodega babies



I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind, you mothafuckas sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Water colors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descendant from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win
I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on



This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided if it hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, and my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking spanish like Don Omar, but
I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
Fuck nigga, with the sly talk
Miss me, with all the pie talk
When them lights on you, and them letters big
You point us out, just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress, 'cause
I'm King Push, still king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best d-boy all I'm missing is a dash
Difference between me and Hova, but
I'm King Push, still king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
