You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons

I sell that dope to your momma tho

These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit

I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em

Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much too hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change

I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis

Never looking back on it, we did what we did
Could never find the time for the people I miss
Thought they had my back against the wall
Well, then tell me who deserve it
Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous
Never made a move out here unless I was certain
Tatted on me, but this shit is deeper than the surface
I'm with everyone that I was here with in the first place
Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness

I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make me fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I call for loyalty, she didn't never answer
You with my ex wildin' with different color candies
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

Kindness, she lie
Still comin', lie
Boss, fuck around, boss
Kindness
Down, like a nigga, she lie
Kindness, oh

Times getting hard but a nigga still gettin' it
Young rich niggas, in this motherfucker

When you wake up before you brush your teeth
You grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees
Shooting craps, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas
God blessin' all the trap niggas

Weighed 1008 grams on the scale
I got a lower case T across my chest
Your crack house doin' numbers then you blessed
You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug
A few bean pies stashed in the trunk
Shoot dice all day and sell dust
You loaded up, they talkin' shit, you gone bust
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut
Sold over a million dimes, I don't give a fuck
What?

Hasta Ia-la-uego wake up with that Glock, okay though
Stash the dope inside a Winnebago in Decatur
You got your work, you posted up in the hood Bodega
Lil' woadie loading up that yopper before he brush his teeth
Gotta roll a backwood up while he count the cheese
We on the turf, getting active on the backstreet
I'm drinkin' Actavis, the only thing that relax me
I'm on drugs, every single day I pop a seal
We talk that lingo 'round here, we try to work a deal
You pull up round here, they serve you here to Dixie Hills
You hit Old Nat, I know on Godby you’ll see a trap house
Gotta cock it back, out here this shit wid-ild

Real dope dealers for real!
Haha! Hahaha

Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope

Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side
I whip me a four way to a nine
The dirty, the money is homicide
And my recipe can't be televised

They move that dope, they move that dope

Young enough to still sell dope
But old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side
Now nothing's big as my ego, Push

Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child
How you think about that coupe, with no roof?
Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Xans
Young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car
Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga tricked up
Now he spendin' that money with Casino!

Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

They came through with a stick and you heard it
They came through in this bitch and they were swerving

We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt

I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, "ride me round the whole world"
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

Fully loaded whip tote fully loaded clips
Fucking with my niggas, I'll smoke a zip

I corrupt your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on them grounds with the dealers and hound
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass em around
I say everything triple time, Rollie, AP, Hublot triple time
I just know the ones you call upon, I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat, everytime a nigga talk a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette, run it back you hear my intellect
Celebratin' like the championship, celebratin' like the championship
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you...
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just wish you'd stop perpetrating like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, niggas straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson; put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone - waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' off of me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another 60 thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick and got my brain washed
And for the shit that got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil lil liquor out, pour a lil malt liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out

Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene it’s homicide
Diamond pinky ring – a lollipop
Fuck the hate – I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin’ harder than the Pacers
I been tryin’ to have some patience
Told my momma she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gonna put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I’m making U.S.D's overseas
That’s U.S. dollars that you can’t achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said “Nigga please.”
For that white girl, she said “Nigga please.”
Playin’ poker – now we’re back at Strokers
I forgot her name, but her pussy’s soakin’
When I seen her on a pole…
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin’ myself that I’m still gettin’ loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded

Rockin’ Tom Ford, poppin’ molly

Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up
When I'm feelin' the stress, then I pour up
Reppin' the set like a soldier
Hop out the Bentley and roll up

Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears still falling down on my last bitch
This money made me hungry, I'm a savage
I've seen the stars lining up you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ah
Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see heron everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean, my nigga still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just paid their bills now
Money make her feel good but damn she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar

I ain't talkin' about some big money shit

She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit

They don’t want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm...

Reporting live from the damn gutter
Swear to god, I will buy this motherfucker, ah

Pink slips sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas  looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really

Put it on my tab, put her on my tab
Franchise tag on me, Bron Bron
Steph Curry wrists, nigga, Oakland
Percies for the bitches Bishop, magic Don Juan
Standing ovation and an encore
And I keep the check, Nike concord

Got a gang of broads riding with me, on drugs with me

Whole time I was ready
They was like, "Hold up, wait a minute"
I was like, "Nah, nigga, let's get it"
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here trying to take some, there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Yeah, yeah, up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May

Nah, nah, niggas is bitter, they hurting
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowing up like it's urgent
And she was acting like a virgin
I gave it to her then I curved her

Niggas for looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really

Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell
Half of y'all might need help
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows
And I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4
Know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep
Take the mask off so you can see

Vengeance is mine, said the Lord

Oooh, yeah

It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly

Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns
Saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels

Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Empty thoughts fill the room
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
Tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, yeah, yeah

Blockbuster niggas running around with real choppers

Pimps up, pimps up, hoes down, hoes down
A pool full of money and I'm 'bout to drown

Yea yea...Future Hendrix

They couldn't be here, you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else

But I ain't worried 'bout no fucking I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to ya
My love don't mean that much to ya
Fucking these hoes mean too damn much to you
I just hope up when you fuck a nigga when you finished
He can say that he love ya
Now do you feel better bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words I'mma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you're fucking another nigga hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga are you thinking about me
Cause I'm thinking about you
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with

I want you to fuck him  in a paradise
Cause I wanna be in your head tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it, don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You going out the country, you posting up on IG
I'm layed up with my side piece
The one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that your pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me your moving on, you don't love me no more
Monster

If anybody know, I know, yeah

Niggas look at us like ‘maybe one day’
Maybe one day, maybe one day
But for now a nigga got the ones with me

Like I got the keyboard and the drums with me
You will understand how I get it though
Man, it’s everything I ever said it is
Mixin' liquor cups with the sedatives

Hope you see the path that I made, I took a chance

Two cups of that dirty, take a dab, blow kush
And we ain't gonna talk about it
Cut you off if you keep pushing
Since I got the fame can't forget I was crooked

Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I grew up on the block, 1 hunnid
I go on The Bluff it's 1 hunnid
I done did enough in the jungle

When I drink out the cup, it's so dirty
Had the blow at the store, they was lurking
Poured a 4 in a cup it was breakfast, sprinkled sauce in my drink and I took it

Promethazine took my concentration
To another level then I elevated
Diamonds hanging on me I'm intoxicated
Diamonds hanging off me I'm intoxicated
Chop it up with a sack chaser
Told you I wasn't going back, baby
Hanging out with some crack babies
Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands, on a few Xans might won't count it
Spend it all in one night, if we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game
I jump on a plane
And run to the stage
I've been working some years for this
Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker
I'm bout to pass out in this motherfucker
This bitch exotic than a motherfucker
These bitches  do anything for me

I’m lookin’ for ‘er

Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don’t want ‘er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Carona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you’d like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don’t get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I’ve met ‘er

Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need ‘er, she come through

Send ‘er my way
Tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er in the broad day
Hangin’ with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep ‘er, yeah you gotta get that pay
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number, you know I can’t wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I’ve tried to go to sleep
And seen ‘er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon

You know, This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'

I been fillin' up garages, what else?
I gave her her first ménage, what else?
Close your eyes eyes eyes
I'm about to slide slide slide
Wonder why why why

Freestylin', let me dance with her
Sky Dweller, it was sentimental
Rose gold, it was cinnamon

Hundreds on hundreds, got a good batch

Fuck up my bitch by the change
Want me to jump out the stage
I wanna jump in the air
You know the love ain’t fair
You killin' then show us the proof

Chain different colors like fruits
I like to hang out the roof
I got to train my bitches
I'm putting chains on my bitches

Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with ya freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the six
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born

Purple Reign
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you, savage

Gon' roll it up my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, squeeze the trigger
Roll up, hop out the car, squeeze the trigger

I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the perkys callin'
I can hear the xannies callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Thinkin' about that cash like it's fast food
I'm thinkin' about this cash like it's fast food
I'm payin' all my tithes, receivin' bad news
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know this cash rules
Everything around me turn to fast food
Standin' in the cold I got no blanket
These hoes always gettin' exposed, ain't got home trainin'
And when I push up in that Rolls and I'm still drankin'
Went from standin' over stoves to the tour bus
Stayed down ten toes aboard the G5
So much yellow gold on me like a beehive
Started rockin' Balmain's like they Levi's
Over time the booth is like a gold mine
I served in Alabama like roll tide

I can hear the Xannies callin'

Aquafina water got me glistenin'
When I whip that Beamer can't you picture me rollin'
Fuck you pussy niggas, ain't no sympathy

I be sellin' pies, chasin' M&M's
Fuck a 9 to 5, get it out the gym
Push illegal weight, we call it out the gym
Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin' do it right, feel like I waited a life time
Weigh up both sides cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dog
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car push start
I'm from apartments, my crib big like Wal-Mart

I got my diamonds on
You got your diamonds on
Watches on watches
I looked down and see beauty
Baby let's go have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex
Yeah, Rich sex, bitch

Baby let's go and have rich sex
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on
Baby girl, go and have rich sex

Never made love to a misfit
You never made love to a misfit
Come and kick a deal on some rich shit
I'ma keep it pimpin' on some rich shit
We can do the show on the jet lift
Fuckin' in the air on the jet, bitch
We can do the helicopter cruisin' over Vegas
Hundred thousand dollars for a watch, count fetti
Kiss on a nigga with his chains on, glizzy
Fuck so good, got both of us dizzy
Do it lowkey, profile, get busy
Do it lowkey, profile, gettin' busy
Got the Audemars Piguet on fleek
Got my number one freak in the sheets
And all she want is the D
And for me to keep this ice on me

Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's kiss for a while, have recess
Let's touch for a while, have recess
Do it for a while like a replay
Let me see you wind that ass up like a DJ
Run that back like a DJ
I know you see this big face
Chandelier froze for a bad one
Come and kick game in your ear while I smash you
And I keep them thangs in my ear while I'm stabbin'
And I catch you hot like the flame and the passion
And I got the flash on deck, no battery
And I have some Tom Fords on while you suckin' me
Cuban link hang off my neck, to your nip from my neck
To my watch and my chain, it's gon' drizzle, gon' drizzle

I woke up feeling like fucking up some paper
Freebandz, Freebandz

If my granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me
If Snupe was living, I know he'd be proud of me
If Lonzo was livin', he never would've doubted me

Only the strong survive
I'm just enjoying my life

I blow a bag today, hope out the whip on 'em, babe

I ran it up with the same niggas
Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell all the dope out them apartments, I did it

Like a lay up
That action

Why did we go all the way?
What do we do, ohhh, when it rains?

When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, give it time, time reveals

We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time

Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

And I can fight temptations off
I ain't soft, no I ain't soft
You can't be lettin' the rap shit go to your head
Can't be cancellin' no shows, fuckin' up your bread
Check out these rumors, that ain't nothin' but the devil
That's why we gotta continue to pray together

My uncle Ronnie used to wash cars
My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a king pin you hear me

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I'm still glad I smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hanging out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning

Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
Esco came to me, he said they think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one
We going back in as soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him in custody they took my life away

I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggy's
I endured so much pain, ain't got Esco with me
Ain't got nobody smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealing with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag we getting back to the paper
Getting back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hating, I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick laying on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doing some real life porno

And I ain't worried about nothing in the world, keep that badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure

I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give them what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the projects, they just know me from rhyming
My hard work finally catching up with perfect timing

You know what I'm saying, I could take a hundred dollar slab and goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?

I get mad zooted, I got this bad thing I recruited
My passion is a movie, I say fuck her 'cause I screwed her
I stay on Miley Cyrus, every where I go I'm screwed up
I know my Texas niggas got my back and that's for sure though
Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tangueray
We ain't never gon' give this fucking life up
I know the boys saying they getting into the money over there
Baby trust me, these niggas not like us
I put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
I gave her realness, and that’s all she gonna get from me
Bonefidé superstar I'm straight up out the hood, uh
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers

I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good

Treasure bring misery, codeine in my delivery
I pulled up in a big B, swerving like a hippie
Moving with the dopers and pushers
In the Rover ducking undercover, hugging the Interstate
Copping a couple cakes and the drum hanging under me
Got a chain hanging over me, God watching over me
All my angels watch over me, I bag it like groceries
Keep some cash flowing over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me
The young niggas under me they gon' stand up in any war
Who built this shit ground up? At the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones, I talk for them niggas
They feel this shit out in Belgium
Freeband Gang

Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit

Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t done a verse in 8 weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mill
And niggas say it’s all good, that’s how you better feel
Nigga nah, fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up

If money talk then your pockets ain't saying shit
I'm in the bathroom getting head from your bitch
And I ain't paying her shit
You want beef? You don't know who you playing with
I tell my pilot to land the jet
I'm hopping off, get 'em, we popping off
Give a click and you niggas dead where you standing at
I'm just a trippy nigga smoking on cabbage
Your money funny like Jim Carrey
I got bitches that's super bad like Halle
And we still keeping that white like Barry
I'm a rich nigga, still keep a pistol with me
Nigga you ain't fuckin' with a picture of me
I got all this cake and shooters with me
Just in case you pussy niggas try to get you a piece
What it is, my nigga? What it's hittin' for?
Where the car you were whippin' in the video?
Where is the ice at nigga? Where them pretty hoes?
You a fraud, real niggas already know
Broke ass niggas, I can't stand 'em
I hit 'em with the cannon
I'm buying off the mall at random
Juicy J, that nigga fresh to death
Smoke it till it's nothing left
Peel off then I'm ghost in my Phantom

This bitch from Australian and I'm an alien

I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy
But I love it baby
When I jump out the whip when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink till I pass out I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter, in the sewer, the streets turn a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super cause she got that super
When I say super that's young Super Future
We never gone lose we never gone lose

Never gone lose cause these bitches gone choose
These bitches gone be who they is
Walking and talking like classy
You a ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be working that boy I'm a poet
Serving that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playing my cards
Whip after whip put up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally then gather the squad
Yeah gather the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafucking tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothing but avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swerving on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe saying we ain't falling off
I'm on loudest green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
They got a magazine with no vizine
Just riding around with this 40
She gone thug for me, she gone thug for me
In O-hi-o that's my shorty
We ain't playing around this dungarees
We gone go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me and then copy
They wasn't playing fair no no, oh no no, oh no no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell the coco you talking to popo
You know that's a no no, you know that's a no no
You know that's a no no no no no no no no
Came at the dopo serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch you stepping in no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-b-b-back with these stallions
Drink after drink, I just carry on
Got the sack on me now I just carry it
Got some m's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagon, 56 nights I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden

I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Yeah, Hendrix

Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for the squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out

I get on the stage and I rap 'til I pass out
Hit another city and another city, I'm just groovin'
I was tryna tell you I was losin'
I was gon' tell you I'm improvin'
I done caught a vibe, she was choosin'
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta keep my focus, I'm phenomenal
Once I cock and load I'm the money man
Got a hundred hoes, got a hundred Xans
We gon' party hard till the moon calls
She done fell in love with the mushrooms
And my college girls talkin' kung-fu
Put some cough syrup in a Mountain Dew
You would never see what I'm goin' through
Gotta take my time with these bad bitches
I don't wine and dine with no bad bitches
Send a flight for a bad bitch
Over night for a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch

I ride for my squad, I'm a champion

I never told the world about you
I never told the homies 'bout you, not once
I never had no bitter towards you
I never had no drama for you, not once
I never want to go to none of these award shows
That's not me
Only the time will tell the day I prevail and get me a Grammy
Lil Mexico, kept it real from the start
If I did it for you it came from the heart
Came from the trenches and turned into art
I wake up and do it way better tomorrow
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
It's mafia all day
We come out the hallways
Murder in broad day, murder in broad day
Sit in the passenger side with the tool in my lap
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin' me now
Our foundation built on loyalty, you can't ruin me now

I rap for the squad, I'm a champion

Freebandz

You know how we be rocking, ya' heard

Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, cause you know I'm getting at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
Word from your motherfucking brother, young nigga
I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
Coming through the cut like a known Grim Reaper
Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle

Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Where ya' man at? heard that the Feds got em
I seen ya' cruise the Land Rover thru the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain’t gon’ see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Man down over yonder
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out nigga, no wonder
Niggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder
Hoes getting X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing

Had the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimming in the water, no paddle
Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
The bird on the bezel, I’m a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these folks, these
Niggas be telling these days, be telling these days

Diamonds and zeros, I'll be your hero, ain't no cape on me
You know talk is cheap
Ain't talking money, ain't no conversating
I've been leanin' all day, I'm faded
And she been fiendin' all day, but can't take dick
Sipping out a 2 litre, put an 8 in it
White linen on my pillow, put her face in it
Baby, fuck it up and do what you like
All these drugs in my body got me seeing double
Ménage à trois, double trouble

Gassing up on lean and good Percs
Lap dance getting pie on my t-shirt
She know how to fuck, yeah
She ain't looking for true love here
Let her see a million, she don't wanna go
I roll a hundred deep, we like sharing hoes
Out of chances, find you three-six-oh

I just want to taste her water
Let's stay hydrated
Tell me, can you stay down?

She out lying it shouldn't even matter, she mine

Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the .50 carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shawty so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycont' got me flown up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, mi casa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, I hope you get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy

Ain't really tryna

I be on the phone with Doe Boy
I be telling him, he inspired me to go harder
Know what I'm saying, real talk

My savages, my savages, my savages
I’m always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I’m on the phone with yo, I ask him how the trial went
35 racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that’s how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting you must don’t respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened they was hating on us
You know when we was juuging for it they was mad at us
Aye, this a letter for my dogs
How we let the money get between us
How we let these bitches get between us
How we let these niggas get between us
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain’t like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil dog caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
RIP my grand-dad Quick, he should have seen this shit
20 thousand on some child support, I seen that shit
Riding round with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me but these niggas ain’t doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn’t love me would’ve been done jumped ship
And it’s the love from my fans got me still here

Monster!
Say I’m Illuminati, they tryna make me catch a body

I don’t know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Big bank saying wipe a nigga’s nose, my girl changed the lock on the doors
Before this shit pour up a fo', ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me? That what you really expect?
You thinking I’m sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that’s my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
The Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There’s money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got a shawty with me, she a pro
No she’ll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars he can’t make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide
I told em I’m through with the pies
Told em fuck all of my wrongs, I don’t even write
We gone leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin
Free all my niggas incarcerated, you heard?
Loyal for life, you heard?
Free band gang! We global now..

Accepting the hate when it's coming
I jumped out the Wraith on them bums
I tell you you're wrong when you're right
I'm never gon' judge, no I’m never gon' judge
You got a nigga, but I know you love me, baby
I know you love me

You niggas ain't seein' me, never, you're never gon' see me
I'm a mothafuckin' boss

I was so hardheaded at first
My grandma didn't even believe in me
I kept goin' though
All I can say is I told you
Jewelry at the bank now in the vault
You should've never doubted me
I'ma work 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath

Yeah you should've never doubted me
The pain and the struggle followed me
My daddy never been there, bothered me
And these cold streets made a man of me
Know a time, it'll come, they doubt me
Had to keep them OGs 'round me
Keep a young, young homie grounded
You never know where your motivation'll come from
We do the most for these broads and pop Chandon
They try to push you aside, you gotta fight some
I had it on the dot and now we ride guns
I want that number one spot, I'm like icon
I got that beast in my eyes, I'm like Tyson
With my heart and my drive, I know I'm righteous
Keep some ice on me, Rocky, Rocky like Balboa
Once you win, win, win you gon' want more
Set a trend, trend, trend, need an encore
I was down on my last when I found myself
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath

I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah

I came from them quarter waters
Every nigga in my gang unemployed
You fuckin' 'round, you must want a gang war
I got ol' girl, then I transport her
Trappin' is a habit, I got Xans on me
I'm hotter than a flame, keep the fan on me
Catch me whippin', I'm Hussein with them bands on me
I'ma kill the competition and I'm playin' for keeps
You see water drippin' off me then catch it
I turned nothin' into somethin', now I'm livin'
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
You didn't recognize my drive, shouldn't have did that
Now I'm flyin' every day, I won't get back
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it

Who knew I would take it to a whole 'nother level
Who knew I've been racin' with a whole 'nother rebel
Shawty wasn't checkin' for me, mama wasn't checkin' for me
I hustle every day just so I can spend a check on you
You my dawg 'til the end, I got so much respect for you
I watched you give up on me, but I never lost faith, did I?
You didn't ever hold me down, then I bought a new safe, didn't I?
Paper plates flushin' in that Wraith, didn't I?
I'm built with a new reputation
Blood, sweat and tears are my new foundation
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation

I got tears in my eyes
My dreams all I got and I'll die for it
If I love it with a passion, I'ma ride for it

Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

And it's a lot of money in the room

After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean

Let’s have a toast to all my niggas runnin’ up in apartments
We had a good year this year, we made a lot of fortunes
And we very fortunate

Yeah, she ain't leave when I was broke
I used to sit at the trap all day and wait for a phone call
She ain't leave when I was broke
Juugin and finessin'

I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

One thing that she didn't do
I don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she won't
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

Came out the sewer, it's stankin'
Go in the booth and I'm blankin'
Slept with my tool on the blanket
Like I'm the son of Michael
All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful
They see my heart has been damaged
You see the whip Panoramic
You see I made it, you witnessed progression
I was talkin' like I knew I was destined
I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it
Whether you like it, you gotta admit it
That I change up your location
That I pull up in that Wraith
Have I fulfilled all your dreams?
I gave you checks
So you're checkin' it off on your wish list
You get Ferraris right now

We goin' shoppin' right now, I see they copy right now
I see they're watchin' right now
They didn't know I was just plottin' right now
I've been executin' the play for a while
Witnessed Chubbie Baby walk down the aisle
I got a few rings on me now
Had to change my team and my style
You can't intervene on my craft

You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom

I could tell you was into me from our instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you want, I dont give a fuck by showing you
You know what it is shawty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breath without me, you gon' need your oxygen
I damn near gave you a overdose on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what’d it be is it heaven sent
Let’s put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us

You could leave today I bet you’ll come back tomorrow
I could see the hate is comin’ from a mile up
And it’s only preparin’ us for what we got comin’
If I did come your way and you feel like runnin’
Run in my direction and don’t you run from me
Cause any time we get together, we goin’ stuntin’
And I’m applyin’ major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It’s lightnin', it’s thunderin', you describin', got me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly
Will you gon ever leave?
Any time you leave my side
I know you comin’ back

My friendship a guarantee
You got my ego in another league

Pure fantasy, I see through it easily

I told the girl I'm 'bout to sell the Porsche, I'm tired of it
She go and told these folks I'm goin' broke, a smile poured
From my lips, 'cause if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up and if I were, why? Would you throw a party?
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man

White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks

Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zippin' through the city and I don't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me, why would I do that to her?
Simplism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
'Cause if I buy one, they gon' sell ten, then what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk
'Til then, I will ride my fuckin' bike, or walk

I told that girl, I told that girl tell the truth
Say she the realest bitch I ever met, then show me some proof
These girls be droppin' these lies, these girls be makin' shit up

My nigga set my nigga up, the game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside the Escalade and crash it
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean

Leather jackets, no motorcycle

9 to 3, that good supreme
With all the stress to blow a gas tank
I work hard and it came out

Then I went from dead broke to layin' up in a penthouse
There are no secrets when you leakin'
I woke up this evenin'
And I seen a demon
I'm on that pure codeine and
Tryna clear my thoughts
Niggas mourn for my pain
All they see is fame and what it bring
I paid dues, graduated from finesse school
I showed and proved, I never lose
I'm too smart, I should've went to Harvard
Drinking out the bottle, holdin' my revolver

Takin' three drugs at one time, duckin' one time
Can you niggas stop hating on Future for one time?
I commit a million crimes
That ain't enough for you
I'mma sell a million rhymes
All that shit I been through
I was grindin' hard
Niggas tried to hold me back
They ain't wanna see me with the plug
They ain't wanna see with the sack
I got it
It worked out
I kept loyal
I set standards
Now I'm royal
Niggas tried to take some paper
Now he gotta take his life

Niggas'll put a hit on your head
Now you walkin' around with a price
Nigga ain't make it to see it

This moment now, this is spiritual
Stay with the fork and the powder to cook
Cause we whip and we add on additionals
Niggas be claimin they working, they working, but nigga we just don't agree with you
Don't none of these bad bitches sleep with you
Ain't no real nigga gon' eat with you
Everybody want a dollar, everybody want a check
Nigga there's only one future messiah, now higher than what you respect
How the fuck you get my number? Hungry ass baby, karma
You ain't never knew my struggle, they will never ever understand my hunger

I wish everyone in there could see it
I wish everyone in here could see it

Ya'll niggas never believed me
Nigga we fresh off the boat, we don't give a fuck about sleeping on floors
Nigga I'm fresh out of court, I just fired my lawyer, then bought a new lawyer
I know you went thinkin' I left you behind
You see what I went through to get here
You know what I came through to be here
Everybody want a piece of me
I wish you could feel all my mama's pain

All I ever wanted for you was to believe in me
I came, I struggled, I made it, I conquered
We redefined gravity, go way beyond Earth

Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Young, fly, and reckless

Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', it comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
High as a fuckin' cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First I had bought a Beamer then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's comin'
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again, if I can be where I'm at today

Let 'em hear the exhaust, show 'em you a boss
Peep how the Christian Louboutins look when I walk
Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Crush the haters with loud pipes
Crush the hater with loud ice
Gotta keep the draco

I can finesse him without pulling out my gun, how he gone still hate me?
I look my demon in the face, I'm booted up the worst way
I bought my Mom a mansion and it came with a lake
I know I'm a rock star and that's on everything

If you love me, love me unconditional
Patience is a virtue then come residuals
These be the realest words I ever said
I'mma try to get to know you, not your physical
Gotta a bad habit and you scared to let it go
These be realest words I ever said

Can't be a baby forever
You gotta crawl before you walk
You comprehend and then you talk
You might just fall, but don't fall off
You get back up and take it as a lost
You live and You learn and it ain't always yo fault
And I just want you hold me down 3-6-5
With no complaining
Relationship get draining
I pray for my sanity
I'm tryna better my family
Through the blood, sweat, and tears
Don't get caught up in the fame, that's how we live
And you wake up and your dreams right in front of you
They say success don't change you, it reveal you

And you sweet too
I would introduce you to my sweet tooth
But I ain't get the chance to personally meet you
But I must say it was nice to meet you
And I hope you don't get offended
I'm in another state of mind right now
And I hope you understand I'm on my grind right now
My vision like a tunnel
Standin' in the jungle
I want to touch your heart but it's music every single summer
I wish you was my home girl
I miss my motherfuckin' uncle
You wanna see this shit more than me nigga
I'mma be all I can be nigga!

You know the dues I paid but the money drive 'em insane
They wanna go to court and sue me and take everything
This devil working on yo niggas and they taking aim

You got a Grammy and young nigga on that purple drank

You can't tell me you got no love for me, no
You can't tell me you ain't got no love for me, no

I done ran into a few complications
Promise me you'll always stay dedicated
You gotta promise me you'll never be scared of love no more
You took the vows, for better or for worse
Please baby, please baby, please
Gave me reason to believe in my dreams
Give me love, that's what I need, that's what I need
I'll travel through time, I walked the line and overseas

Before do anything, we're doing us
I didn't have no more patience, I was in a rush
I fell in love with music, just like us
You work at Magic, baby can you love me?
You see the moon comin' out at night
I got a wolf standin' by my side
We do these girls three at a time
I'm in my world, I'm out of time
Three different highs, I'm off the ground
Look in my eyes, you see my trials
You see my tribulations, I was down
I seen the sweat running down the wall
We tryna have a good time
We toastin' it up at the juke joint
Sit by the bar at the juke joint
Made love in the car at the juke joint

I'm standin' in the middle of an orgy
I put a smile on a whore bitch
I feel like my life is completed
I feel like it's timin' with everything

Feel like it's timin' with everything
I stood in the middle of an orgy
She did it right, it was gorgeous
She lookin' right, she was gorgeous
One hell of a night, it's a portrait

Sometimes I'm rappin' this
When I know I shouldn't be doin' this
Hopin' that the end results
I don't aim to ruin this
Palm trees influenced this
Chronic trees influenced this
Tootsies in Miami
These girls, they influence this
The JW Marriott in Dubai, it influenced this
Take a few laps on the horses before the sun sets
And I can see it from my window
I can see this from my window

One hell of a night

If you gang, gang, gang, that's what's up with me
Fire Marshall

Drove it too long, time to swap it out
We got papers, flip my stones, it ain't no clouds

Got them baby bottles, full of activis ain't playing

Got to cost over 80 racks just for me to gone sit in

On another level, we put diamonds in our cross
Keep that heavy metal, like a rockstar so dont you cross
From another planet, yes, yes, yes I am
I got ya baby mamy, she in love with who I am
Riding Panoramic, with the turbo booster
She got the red on her, like she down with suwooo

The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

Way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
Gotta drop a half a brick if you wanna put me on a flyer
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me to Grady's
A young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
For the haters I'mma go ahead and do it 360
Drinking on a Sprite got lean all in it
I'm a Astronaut nigga better trust my pimping

Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid, no such thing as limitation
Just left Magic in the motherucking basement
Gotta thing for me, they wanna sing for me
They like my energy, I'm an embassy
You will re-appear and go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walking when you walking
I was an Earthling now im SciFi
Wallah, I stay high
My bitches on they high horse
And crawl out in that new Porsche

Ay, man, I'm pullin' out the mo'fuckin Ritz the other day
Man I pull up on my Potnah Beano
You know what I'm sayin'? Real boss nigga
He like Future, "You deserve that shit nigga"

You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
I done paid so many dues, I never lose my cool
Just the other day, my lil’ cousin call me from school and said

Ain’t asked for this, I work for this
I was in the dungeon, just purchasing
Catch the juugins, I paid attention
Know how I'm living, my slang tremendous
I’m better than you and I know it
I will show it
You ain’t flowing how I’m flowin’
That’s why I’m goin’
Places you ain’t goin’
I'mma keep goin'
And goin' until I’m growin’
To a mogul, come up with explosive
I pick that up from rico
My cousin had my back from day one, mano y mano
I believe in keepin’ it one thousand and stayin’ humble
You’re right, I told to take the route through the jungle
Keep the same integrity when I was standing on the corner
Hit the studio, and spit that crack of heavy on ‘er

I go so fucking hard, till my heart skip a beat
I always been expensive, ain’t nothing about me cheap
I'm the realest nigga you ever seen
Since Michael Jackson – Billie Jean
All this pain can't even rappin’
Sometimes I feel like I wanna sing
It goes without me saying
The fruits of my labor I laid down a solid foundation
You water a seed too long and it'll grow
You stay down and grind for long and it’s gon' show
It brings water to my eyes just to hear me on the radio
You would not understand the route I had to take to get here so
Now people hit me up and say these rappers cheesy

We on that drank we on that drank
I got 20,000 on me by mistake
How can I not ball until everything fade away
How can I not, how can I not

How can I not make a movie
How can I not do this shit that these niggas don't love
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not? How can I not? How can I not?
How can I not get this guala and flip all this guala
Because a young nigga was starving
How can I not make this music for dealers and killers and niggas who out there be robbing

Run in your spot, smashing your ho, fuck on your couch
Quit running your mouth, pimping my pen beginning to end
Telling the plot, look at my watch, fuck all your thoughts
I appreciate you niggas I appreciate you bitches for keeping me relevant talk all you want
Brag all I want, how can I not make you niggas regret
How can I not go and get me a check
How can you not get hooked on percocet
How can you not be the one who was star
How can you not be the one who was king
How can you not come around and I stare at these niggas and niggas be rocking this bling
Cum bitch then cum again, how can I not want to fuck your friend?
Proper game make em all wonder how it feel being with a pimp
Everyday something different money cars clothes different
Me and money got a chemistry, me and you a big difference

Gotta get this guap, set down that block, scrape them pots
Gotta call this plug, count this check, how can I not
Gotta work them spots, work them Glocks, watch that clock
Gotta move these bricks, I'm on probation bitch I'm hot

Them freeband niggas got all that money but BMG how we stamp them blocks
We remix bricks in Mexico you know we take a half off top
Jugg with my money nigga how can I not, fuck you mean I got 20 spots
Niggas swagger jacking off of Future trying to steal his spot

Maybe you're guilty or innocent
This is New York, it ain't working out
Wishing we all can go back in time

About to feed my dogs, need pedigree, oh
Ain't letting no money get away from me, ohh
TSA ain't ready for me
These bitches wish they was bartenders, just to get next to me
The latest coupe, way too fast, you can't get next to me
And I want the smoke, for real
These 40's gone choke, for real
.45, no colt
Nigga getting left afloat
Nah, we ain't writing no note
Never, nah
I ain't gotta ride to the store no more
I'ma let the Maybach go
The pent' got a pole in it
The marvelous Raf Simons
Four levels in it
I ain't even know you was in it

You can make love in the morning
Cat Mink flow, I'm warm
Got millions, just stay calm
Nigga get turned upside down
I was Rich way before the Gang
I was Slime way before the name
Kill shit like Sudan
And that's all I gotta say
Ain't leading you wrong

Runnin' the cars
Stealin' bombs
Hope you blow up
Soon as we give it to the streets, the price go up
Up, up out of here, gone to Mercury
All Chanel stores around the globe heard of me
Might as well give it 'em now and catch the first degree
Steven Spielberg shit with the currency
I can't let her go nowhere, she too pretty, truthfully
She gone have a bad day, she ever think about crossing me
I done paid all the lawyers, but they can't talk for me
When it come to closing deals, I finger fuck currency
Almost got frostbit when I rocked my AP
Give this bitch a minute to breathe
Looks can be deceiving, yeh
Looks can deceiving
We going through life speeding
She took the phone, I think she scheming
Ain't been to sleep been stopped dreaming
If it ain't stress, you must be grieving
Looks can be deceiving

You know I just bought another shovel
This year we buried a lot of bags, you dig?
Wheezy beats

Yeah, I'm trappin' out the Wraith in the winter

God protect me from all of the bogus, the niggas who roguish

Threw a 60 on my wrist, 120 round my neck
Just to flex last Sunday, 50 thousand on a 'Vette
30 thousand dollar Rolly, got it draped up in baguettes
20 thousand dollar flights, Freebandz ridin’ jets
A lot of rappers get extorted, gotta pay for they respect

Bloody Goyard that's a checky
This bad Ethiopian gave me Becky

A nigga rich, the bitches brag on the Boss shit
My condolences, I heard about your losses
Killing these niggas, Ricky Ross about to floss it
I got her pussy popping on my triple beam
Black bottles or you know we sipping lean
Drinking the yellow or the red, I want the green
On leather seats, and I'm on Promethazine
Lamborghini's back to back, look like a car race

And my Venezuelan yeah, gave me Becky
Diamonds shining all on my neck

All glass white house, sleeping with the toolie
Bad bitch by the pool, looking like a movie
Chandeliers in the background, on the ceiling
Make sure before I die, my niggas got a million
These bitches chasing me like I'm a dream
I'm married to FreeBandz, that's forever
I got Floyd pulling up at the house on a yacht
I'm a millionaire and I'm havin' way with these thots
Pull a chopper, put a few Dracos in them spots
You was coolin' off, and I was warming up, now I'm hot
I got bitches like new shoes, they don't come out
I got shooters gonna make the news if they pop out
Too many diamonds on, they got me snowboarding
Tell ya fuck the kid, but ain't got nun' to show for it

Credit card fraud, busting checky

I hate if you love her, I'm gon' fuck her
Five plain watches in my duffle
I got 20 freaks in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I spent 20,000 on a jacket
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets

I just took a meeting out in Aspen
You get out of line, it's gon' be drastic
Pay my dawg a Perc, it made him happy
Put you in a hearse like an assassin
Runnin' through the game in some Ballys
I just want the green like Aladdin
She kept it low-key, I was straddlin'
I gave her more wood than a cabin

20 freaks at the embassy
I just pissed on a 100 Gs
Ace of Spades when the lights off
Wrist movin' like CB
Bought the Lamb' for the energy
Got your main at Top Golf
Check, check on me, roger that
Draco on me', roger that
Lean on me, roger that
Check on me, roger that, check
Check the work, 10-4
Codeine, indo
Wrist cost a Bentley truck...
Wrist cost a Bentley truck
Had drugs on me, lot of red
Then I hit the globe, a lot of red
Copped a speedboat and docked it
Left-overs in my pocket
I'ma take her like a rocket
I'ma hold this money hostage

America has a problem

Wish a nigga take away the pain
Thinkin' I can blow away some pain
Wishin' I could slow down fame
I'm tryin to substitute everything
I'm tryin' to substitute everything

Today I took a Xanny, I started missin family
I don't see them as much, I know they feel abandoned
I'm workin 'til I pass out and now I understand it
From where I come from, every moment we tryna' take advantage
I got my prescription, prescribing, then hit the pharmacy
I got some hoes that been diving on my mind, mentally
Roll up the kush, and let’s get high, and take you to a galaxy
See I just wanna be in my zone, where nothin' bothers me

Thinkin' I can blow away some thangs

I believe hard times made me like this
I don’t leave the studio, I like making hits
There’s broken relationships that I can’t fix
I got bad habits I picked up, I can't kick
I need my herb, I need my syrup
Now I'm free like a bird
I make a lot of mill's, I had to pop a pill
Just to get a thrill
You don't know how I feel

This bitch filed for child-support like I don’t take care of my child
She want them stacks I got on me, she wanna see me down
I had to take a molly, it lift me off the ground
I'm tryin to keep everybody happy, bring in the scripts
Everything calm and collective when I'm smoking on sess
Maybe this is the sound of faith, maybe this a test
I spend a lot of money so I don’t be depressed

The drug dealers need to know
That we want them out of our schools, neighborhoods and our lives
And the only way to do that is to take the customers away from the product
Say no to drugs
And say yes to life
‘Course your local drug pusher – they tell you a little something different about these drugs
And who you believe is up to you
Goddamn it. if you do it as enclined at least it won’t be out of ignorance, just stupidity

Some days I can't get out of my head
That's just the dark side of me
Some nights, it's hard for me to fall asleep
If you ever ever call my name, name
You will find out that we're both the same
When the lights go out, I need to know
Are you afraid of the dark?
I'm not afraid of the dark

I'm just livin' by tradition
You might die for disrespect
Last time I checked, I ain't ever been scared of nobody
Who gon' be there for the good times and the bad?
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back

Some days I close my eyes and fade away
And I fade away
Some nights all the colors turn to grey
Just like the dark side of me

I went way beyond anyone's expectations
Got the 'Rarri turned on just in case we're racin'
I was already in the third gear by the time niggas hatin'
Who gon' be in the field for me when I make it?
Started off in the trenches, how I'ma ever go pop?
Already on the moon, already with the goons
I'm already on Easter, I'm already as a teacher
Watch for the throne, I'm like Yeezus
They tryna clone me, thinkin' I don't see 'em
They take subliminal shots thinkin' we don't hear 'em
I'm one-of-a-kind, that's how I'm gon' kill 'em

I've got a human heart
The dark, the dark
The dark, the dark, the dark
Are you afraid of the dark? The dark

Whatchu lookin for
I'm lookin for a bitch
That'll stay down for a nigga through thick and thin

That's all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider

Got a bankroll now full of hundreds
I could let you blow it right now uh hu
If everythang failed would run run through the rain, shine, thunderstorms
Would you fuck with the kid where I'm from... Gotta hold my bond, hold my gun
When days get tight and I come in sweaty, Would you kiss all over me with yo tongue
Would you ride for the kid, would you lie for the kid? Death before dis-honor
When I'm on the road doin shows from Mississippi all the way to Hong Kong
I just need to know these two questions

Would you die for yo nigga

If some things on my mind I need to get off
Can I come to you?
When I need to talk
If I ever get lost, can you help me find my way back to my vault
Would you cherish yo kid like you never had did

Could you love me? Could you love my kids?
Can you be there for me like you never had been
Like any relationship you ever been in
We make a connection that's full of affection
Can you hold me down, Knowin my profession
Will you wait for me patiently, tastefully
Will your loyalty lead to royalty
Can you answer these two questions please

Take you on the town, Baby everythangs on me

But this exactly how a nigga feelin', when I'm higher than the ceilin'
Can't feel my face, it's numb, and ain't got no feelin'
And I'm in NASA blowin' strong, what the fuck I'm on?

Got horses, no saddle, my bitches are badder
With asses that's fatter, you trip and you chatter

The girls are pretty, the nights are long
Aye, no sleepin' for us, when we drinkin' tough
I gotta stay up, I took me an up
Now I'm buck as fuck, I go fill my cup
I crumble my kush and fill my blunt up
I'm close, I'm chillin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
I put the place all into motion, in motion
I grind and grind, keep goin' and goin'
I'm blackin' out on track, like I don't know where I'm at
Talk to Scotty and he talk right back
I'm diggin' your body, your ass really fat
I'm losin' my breath, asthma attack

When I get drunk, Juice, I get sloppy, pissy
I blow good good in every city
Countin' money, palms still itchy

I'm smokin' presidential, drankin' yellow, this shit need a suit
Fucked up in the Phantom like Tony Montana, bitch let back the roof
Your girl down on my head, she grippin' that head just like a wave cap
And I get them bottles poppin', Juicy J don't save caps

Addicted to the weed, I'm a fuckin' addict

I flip a stack to stack, rack to rack, ball to the max
Smokin' all this weed, so geeked like I don't need lungs

And I keep a dime bitch on my side, plus a nina
And they both will get you wet like Aquafina

You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me
On a whole ‘nother level, me and you we light the room up, only together
Every time we havin' sex we gotta break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
And we don’t wanna go to sleep, cause we too obsessed
With the high life, and we gon' blast up like a rocket when the time right, and when the time right

And your style is impeccable, you’re so fuckin’ incredible

And it ain’t nothing for her I can’t do
And when I’m with ‘er I got nothin’ to prove
She accept me for me and I take you for you
We get high as the skies and get past the moon
We got a special connection, we could light up the room
We some astronaut, maine, no cartoon

ReRock stone like Fred Flintstone

They hate to see the type of shit that we on
The ice on chill, shoe game nasty
The bank roll won't even fold
These niggas jealous
I can see it in they faces, they wanna trade places
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Haters coming faster then I ever seen them come before
Racks on racks they say I was a one hit wonder, where I go
To the top where I belong, Im from the corner slanging stones
20 mixtapes in a year, you know the type of shit I'm on
Fly, shit, only, thats just the code that I live by
Tell me I can't do it, it won't work, and Ima' still try
Try to hold me back and doubted me, they did it several times
You can never underestimate a nigga like my kind
Ima' rebel, Im a warrior, and I'll destroy ya
All these dues I paid you go need more than a judge of lawyers
You put my back against the wall, Ima' come out standing tall

Money multiplying, soon flatline
Yall niggas can't even see me in the daytime
Bank' America on speed dail, Im eatin' now
Stacking every penny just incase I go to war with yall
Im just a young hood nigga with a lot of class
& im swagging you niggas, body bags
You see the way I perform, these girls is loving my charm
I love my city and they love me back
My chain looking like a camera when it flash
Im hungry for that money, and Im getting cash
Im in that big body with 200 on the dash

You want that hermes shit, I got it for ya
You want that ysl, I got it for ya
I went from rags to riches and now I'm spoiled
I know some Freeband Gang niggas who loyal
They said we wouldn't be shit, but some finessers
Now we pulling up in them fully loaded compressors
And now the tables have turned, I moved on
It ain't no animosity, I moved on
And they dont wanna see you make it where I come from
And they don't like it that I'm famous no uh uh
You need to take a look at what I dun become
How many niggas you know can turn nothing into something

Unorthodox

Chandelier diamonds, champagne
I'm fillin' my cup up with good drank
I know these drugs could be contagious
I fell in love like a new fragrance
New kids on the block, I'm sensei
Hold the candles high in your memory
Spin the block and let it rain get it done, done
I'm the man, I'm the man like Mister Dun Dun
It's Blood or die, me and Guwop

Pearls in your eyes, ain't no shades for you

And I'm higher than a kite, feel like scrooms off of me

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'

I was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
Running from polices, jumping over fences
Serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
Taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
The teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
Make your outlook on life different, damn you look suspicious
My granddad died a boss, and that's been on my memory
If you listen closer to me, feel the pain in my delivery
The struggle and the pain, I still remain the same
I'm grinding so hard I'm just strengthening up my brain
Flyer then the plain, moving faster then the train
Get the fuck up out my lane, some things gotta change

Damn it feel like yesterday I'm at the corner store
When the po-po ran up on me in Mexico
I dropped the blow I swear I never ran that fast before
And when I play it back in my memory in the studio
I swear I grind and I grind going hard every time
Going hard on my grind
Selling damaged bricks, shit be at a bunch of licks
I write a hundred songs every time I think of this
Take a 2 liter fill it up with codeine
Let's take a toast to all my niggas who ain't here with me
And I'm a ride I'm a ride
Until the rubber off the tires, only the strong survive

My glasses made from Germany, designer on me permanently
These scars on me permanently, this pain insides burning me
But it ain't killing me, It's boosting up my energy
I'm on my way to Tennessee, doing a show for 10 a key
And these streets they're a beast out here
I don't plan on coming home I might leave you this year
And shawty I know you ride for a nigga
But you get tired of a nigga, tired of crying over your nigga
So many lies, so many broken promises
I hate it come to this, I took you through a bunch of shit
Feel good to your side, I tried to buy you a bunch of shit
But you don't take it no more, you sick and tired of it

I got the cash in my pocket right now and it's folded up, ain't got no wallet
I order Ace of Spades cause when I pour up I drink out the bottle
Cash on delivery, keepin' a pole on me if it's a problem
Bitch, don't spit on me, if you gone hit on me you gotta swallow

You already know the niggas that roll with me ain't nothing but robbers
You already seeing this ice that I got on, it's looking like water
'Cause already knowing this Audemar cost me like two quarters
Already knowing we jumpin on the plane, we gettin' the charter
You already knowin' I gotta get paid, so send my deposit
I seen the smoke, it was rising
Burn down the house, I was vibing
Come through the hood, I was sliding
A nigga be dead if he try me
Got a beautiful chick sitting beside me
I came from the creek, it was violent
Police in the street tryna find me
You put me on charts and I climb 'em
I was ducking them narcs, I was grinding
Now I jump 'cross the stage like I'm flying
I go harder and harder with timing
I'm just filling the void, I can't hide it
I'm just taking the poison and I know it
I got way too much money to show it

Bitch, don't spit on me, if you gon' hit on me you gotta swallow

Bitch if I hit on you you gotta worship me like I'm your father
My bitch know every time we go out shopping I spend over a quarter
Big pole, sippin' and whippin' the gold, you know how I'm vibing
Sitting low, high in the back, when I pull up the Maybach be gliding
You see how I came with that Dolce, I pulled up on low, my diamonds gon' cloudy
This big gasoline when I roll up
Them V12 machine when I roll up
Pineapple pink when I roll up
Just try not to faint when I roll up
Step in the paint like I 'post up
Hopped off the train and I growed up
I was catchin' the MARTA and growed up
When I pull out garage, the door's up
I pull out a four door and chauffeur
Stop all the faking and posers
I'm the only one slangin' that raw dust
Your homies playin' with that raw 'tuss
We spend our own money, it's all us

Bitch, don't spit on me, if you gon hit on me you gotta swallow

I was ducking them narcs, I was grindin'

Check out how she hella, somebody oughta tella her
Her ass gotta voice and she sing acapella

Lean inside my cup
And I put ice inside my watches
Ordered up that new coupé
I just left the dealer
Ballin' like I shoot hoops
Michael Jordan my nigga
ESPN and Showtime
Want to see my highlights?
Future is a rock star
And I live that high life
Bottles in my section
Didn’t you seen them sparkles
Shawty in Giuseppe's
Ain't that girl a model?
Splurging is a hobby
Money not a problem
Yes I am a rich nigga
Came straight from the bottom

I ain't got a label i'm independent
Me and mamma summa love we independent
I ain't got a boss on this label he very dependent
I sold the bricks to feed my dependence
This life i'm depicting i'm really living
I get a hundred percent not no pennies
I'm in the trap we're blowing white pennies
If you not a hundred you not at all
I popped the seal and I drank it all
I rolled it up and I smoked it all
I found a borne and I buy it all
Where im from ain't no hope at all
He not a hundred he not all
He not a hundred he lying yall
If they see a kilo they'd probably get nervous
I took a bill and I made myself flourish
Look at lil mama her body so perfect
Just like a candle we take the money and burn it
Its different for us we had to go and earn it
I stay away I see them niggas lurking
I stay away I see them niggas skin
Ran on the bed but I thought I was dreaming
That money dirty so I gotta clean it
That money filthy so i gotta wash it
Can't let a pussy nigga 'round my pocket
Can't let a sucker nigga come and stop it
Can't let a hating nigga come and pop me
Hoes taking pictures they love me
Niggas I grew up with ain't that funny
I ain't ever gone change for the money and i'll never let you come and take it from me
Fans lock me up ask was it worth it
I looked at them and said dam right its worth it
I hear the more I smile i'm earthly
Up early trappin' when them birds are chirping
I ride around and i'm servin
I close a lil niggas curtains
Ain't got a label im independent
Me and momma summa love we independent
Ain't got a boss on this label he independent
I sold the britches to feed my dependence
I found a brone and I buy it all
He not a hundred ya feel
I'm rocking Louboutin Christian
I'm counting dead people watching television
Somebody stealing this 20 gram
And when I catch him imma cut off his hand
Come get some work and join the clan
You need some work come see the man
Come here lil shawty come fuck the man
How he a boss with a c.e.o
He not a O.G he just a hoe
No he not real he a facade
He wear that real nigga camouflage
He got that street nigga starter kit
If i start it imma finish it
I see the judge give my nigga forty
They just gaveled and sentenced him
We the shit nigga where you been
We let a 18 wheeler burn the men
I seen the Feds take my partner in, then they gathered around and rubbed it in
If he could've done it all again we'dve seen the wall and followed him in
Always working never calling in

Stashed a half a million dollars in the closet like some shoes

Break the rules for a killer, break the rules for a dealer
Break the rules for a boss, make the rules for a nigga
Break the rules
Half a million dollars in the closet in the stash, like some shoes

Cookin' dope, breakin' rules, whip it back, make her choose
Flippin' packs of Peru, can't push that, that's a juug
Sellin' dope at the school just to go get the Jordans
Gotta go get the socks, comin' up off of rocks
Never talk back to cops, comin' up with scenarios

Pour up the medication in the Sprite and stir it 'round
Aye fuck my registration, I'm in them paper tags now

Paparazzi catching me with the shits

Fell asleep in the bitch on a xan
Fell asleep in her pussy on a xan
Fell asleep in her pussy on a Perc
I fell asleep in her pussy on a pain pill
Fell asleep in her pussy on a xan, tired
Fell asleep in her pussy on a Perc, tired
Fell asleep in her pussy on the lean, I'm wired
Fell asleep in her pussy on a xan, I'm tired
Fell asleep in her pussy on the lean, I'm drinkin'
Fell asleep in her pussy on the lean, drinkin'
Fell asleep in her pussy on a xan, snorin'

I whip the Lambo off the lot doing donuts
I whip the chicken in the pot it was uncut
I whip the sprite and the lean then I poured up
I whip the white and the green, I got it sewed up
Got the whip game sewed up
I got that whip game sewed up, I got that whip game sewed up

I got that whip game sewed up, I'm a chemist
Dropped 1000 gram, made it 15 hundred
That's a whole split nigga playing with my arm
My whip game got all four pockets flooded
You got the Act on you nigga get pour it up
You gotta nine, give me a rack and I'll mix it up
Nigga I came all that curf, 50-50 swag
Yeah I got 5 spots, nigga going ham
Wasn't playing with that fuck boy, you can't lose
Teach a nigga game for free, you going against the rules
You can't play both side boy you gotta choose
I'm whipping dope in my Rari, nigga fuck the shoes

I'm in the kitchen know I'm water whipping
I'm a trap like Church's Chicken
Me and Leezy remix all our bongs
I drop a whole brick, it won't loose a fucking crumb
I put that Kirkwood across my arm
If I say you can't come then you can't come
I gotta whole ace served up
Check my resume, I been getting them dump trucks
My partner Phil got that lean, and it raw and it clean
2 cups you'll be sleep, I'm water whippin' in my sleep

I'm stainless
Tethered by earth and flame
Mixed with time and pain
Ingrained with higher purpose know the worth of my name
And the product I done came with
Not blameless for the straps and the dope that I hold
The sacks that I sold
Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food
And her back never lacking of clothes
This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact
Matter of fact it deranges
The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes
We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness
In the back of our minds are the nastiest lines that a dope emcee never came with
Once we get tired of fakin', unchain the beast in the brain that awakens
See the clear path that I used to couldn't see
Be the kind of artist that I thought I couldn't be
Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee
So I purify my soul in the land of the fire
My sweat and my tears dull pain
And the blood that I leave on the battlefield proves what I've always known
I was born to reign

I had a bitch hit my phone say she rolling up some weed
Another on the way that say she pouring up some lean
I hope they come together like a muh' fucking seem
Said I hope they cum together like they fucking in a scene
Ima muh' fucking G, you niggas never thought about it
You tryna' be like me? You niggas just some carbon copies
You say you in the streets? Word mane, with your heart?
You wouldn't touch a key, if your first name was Mozart
Yeah, so pussy nigga stop lying
The only time you on a site is pussy nigga dot com
You pussy niggas not sly, so stop with all that hate sport
Or the next time I'm with Wayne bored, I'll knock you out with his skateboard, hanh!

Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl
Send it over from New Mexico & Let me Work

'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Yeah, beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
2 cellphones ringing at the same time
That's your ho, call her from 2 different phones
Tell that bitch we need to fuck alone
See you fuck her wrong, & I fuck her long
I got a love/hate relationship with Molly
I rather pop a ollie, & my dick is a Trolley
Boy I bury you like Halle, & these hoes say I'm blind
Cause I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump & grind
& I just received a package, them other niggas taxing
Man my pockets so fat, I'm starting to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for some chickens
& he already home man that nigga must be snitching
Cut him off like Karate

Designers on my face cause I will never see a hater 50,000 dollars worth of jewelry, future, taylored
Gucci aviator, I stay high than elevators kings, Jacksons, Jones you know the Mexico I'm major
Commando guns only freebands can save ya, transformal cars pulling up in some in place
We got that freeband money and we got that long paper tossing up yo baby mama with no conversation
She like the way I flex with my astronaut persona, I rather take my shoes off if it ain't Dolce & Gabbana
Two cups filled up, we drank, strong marijuana, what's the use of having muscles if you can't flex all summer

Ugh I'm on my slug boo and shit, it's cold out here, I got on Ugg boots and shit
And future they hating they just love doing them but I'll rock that crew thug boo and them
And I be nutting up know homo, ya girl just gave me her throat no vocals
It's skateboard skooly and rk kaelub it's rich kids for life we on a rk way up
They say they seen skooly pulling up in that lam thang, now meet the new member of freeband gang

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

It don’t matter where you go, you are who you are
And when you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold as your heart, you as cold as your heart

I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties
Goin’ through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete
Wouldn’t believe they had for me
Show and prove, don’t make believe
I’ll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Privet in a large coat
This ain’t no shit that I wrote
I’ve been down this road before
And I’ve been on the rollercoast’
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin’ like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' a life sentence and he died
While I’m on the road, doin’ shows, takin’ this ride
I just got word my uncle tried commit suicide
This the second time I’m goin’ back in, the second time
You’ll get a second chance at livin’, nigga I ain’t lyin’

I gots the homies, they go hauntin’ me, the world too
I wish I made this up, it was a fairytale
I know the kingpin’s on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain’t a Tyler Perry
This be a about real life, it’s very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Try to stay in this booth and never come out again
My lil’ cousin called everybody and he’s still fightin’
And I got killaz walkin’ me ‘broad, Future all they recitin’
And I can’t forget you made me be a too much bide
But I ain’t gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type

I take a trip a rapper give, run up there like MX Miff
Go to New York with this girl and I come back with a lip
Break bread with my team
Partner money here her
And confidence, I want my music global
I’m gonna see who bump their fist
I’m gonna change a nigga life
So he ain’t gotta go through this
Don’t get caught in my fit
Till I’m runnin’ 1 0 6
They tracked me ‘cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect
I stick to the code
I hold a tol on my shoulder
But I will never fall
No snitches allowed, case closed

They check my résumé – that thing say it's solid
Check my fabric, Chanel and Fendi, all over my body
Ferrari seats ostrich, Forges got that thing squattin’
Gotta keep that thing – I know these niggas watchin
Got that extendo, on that tec, muphucka
Bought a car, got some rims for that muphucka
Copped the spot, put that glass in that muphucka
Just got a house, I paid cash for that muphucka

We crucial, got that cannon in this muphucka
You tripped up my cameraman in this muphucka

That boy a mark, that boy Casino in this muphucka

We in the station straight flexin’ in this muphucka
Scooter, how you get that pound in this muphucka?
You know we got them pistols in this muphucka
I shoulda bought the kitchen in this muphucka

Turned her Sunday kitchen to a fuckin’ dope business
Black amigo niggas known for water whippin’
We bust them bails down and remixin' pigeons
Check my résumé , I never told nothin’
Whoever your favorite rapper is, he ain’t sold nothin’
Don’t ride Bundts, throw some Forgis on that muphucka
You wanna stretch it? Throw some water on that muphucka

100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining

I just keep on grinding, stacking up my lumber
I just keep getting' money, I put that on my mama
Rackin' up them Benjamins, I blast off like Jetsons
Plugged in with the Haitians, I keep it real with my Mexicans
Belt by Ferragamo, shoes by Chanel
Cook that good dope and I can eyeball a bale
Crooked bitch, my Rolly, flooded my wrist is
Sauce on my shoe game, put sauce on my bitches

Everything around me, just can't even stop shining

And I ain't never gon look back

See, you deserve a night off and I know what to do with it
Take those Vikki’s right off, grab your hair and pull on it

In any kind of weather, no one can do you better
That pussy, I ain’t scared of, girl, I can make you wetter
No bra under her sweater, I’m ready to eat it up
So turn on the lights, I’m looking for her, I’m looking for her

She got me leaning, feels like I’m po'd up
'Bout to sip this fo' up, and turn on the lights

You know I don't play
So if you wanna play

If you wanna win my heart

And if you go before I go, it's one thing you need to know

Um, that Drunk in Love song, was that your song that Beyoncé and Jay-Z did?

Fish parkay, numb ya face when ya taste
30K in the club, shit, you wanna play?

But before you hit a plug, you used to call up your connect
You could tell I fuckin' fish I mean I'm playin' with a check
Got that money on my mind and it's easy to finesse
You got them racks on top on racks, that fish parkayin' is the best
Rockin' Cartier, oh yes, straight like chandelier oh yes
Aquafina clear, oh yes, Future outta here, oh yes
I brought the base with me, you could bet a cake on it
Got some old habits, ain't nothin' changed, I'm still on it
Spent so much on platinum, the kid shoulda been on it
Put the money to ya nose, you could smell the dust on it

Got bands, got racks, got cash, got stacks

Got pounds, got euros, got bacon, got scratch
Move packs, flip packs, get cash get get it
Get Grants, get jets, get green, get lean
Get Franks, got Macs, wanna play? We ready
Two stacks, three stacks, four stacks
Twenty mil', twenty mil', forty mil', we ready.
One comma, two, comma three, come and get llama get
Llama gotta get a dog, gotta add up digits
Few fishtail I'm too exquisite
Parkay fish, you could try lil' fishes
All these hits until we spend a sack
And since you know we did it
Yeah we did it, too consistent
I stay with it
We don't do it for the fame all we want is guap
We don't do it for the bitches cause we been had blocks
Get that cash, get that cash, want it off top
Put that money to ya nose get some dust in it

In the club tippin' the bartender with the old money
Cause I gotta keep the new money up in the safe
So I'm up in the VIP givin' out old hundreds
You could see them muthafuckas been around the way
Out on the block, in K-Town with the hustlas
Made it out South, goin' pier up after tier
Made it to the bitches to the strip club
Inside the thong goin' hip up after hip
Dirty money movin' around in the vicinity
If everybody gotta get it they be up in it when they on the grind
This here my play money
Some money I made before '09
If I see a nigga talkin' about I'm broke, I'ma tell a nigga man please
I'm still spendin' bucks from Adrenline Rush and my Slow Jam cheese
Bank accounts don't freeze, cause the flow is too cold
My stacks don't fit in my pocket cause the dough is too old, niggas be tellin' everybody they be ballin' but they don't run it
New paper put up, because I got them old hundreds

I ain't tripping off no pussy

I'm flying first class flights on these pussy niggas
I just found that was yo wife I got that pussy nigga
I rock a whole lot of ice on a pussy nigga
I'm changing up my foreign cars on these pussy niggas
I'm balling like I'm in the NBA on pussy niggas
I'm kicking shit in Louie like a soccer ball nigga
You see me splurging on my nerves & to these pussy niggas
I got my check & I be working on these pussy niggas

Im living larger, the richer part or Im spitting lava
I'm getting that paper, I ain't slowing down, nigga I enjoy it
When you get famous they hate it, its like you can't avoid it
I'm in the front of plane sitting right next to the driver
You ain't nothing but some cheap pussy lil nigga I'll buy ya
I got em scared, I'm attacking niggas like Michael Myers
I be directicting my own movies, I'm Future Tyler
I stay connected, I'm shipping it, I'm my own supplier
I get to moving & flipping it, set the trap on fire
You cooking dope & shoot pistols well then you getting higher
You got to know how to sell whatever that's all required
Im looking at all these niggas funny, Richard Pryor

I got my feet up, I'm kicking it like I'm David Beckham
Ima' keep it trill nigga, Im on another level
V & G And BBG I'm folding Versace sweaters
They want me to be the one to take them up out the ghetto
I can't take no sauce my nigga I'm trying to stack it tall
I was talking to the pilot, by then we taking off
I just left the city, got some head from the flight attendant
Im in a grill like a dentist & all my clips extended
I put the ice in the chain that's how they recommend it
I dont know these bitches name, I know these bitches switching
They go smash me cause I'm Future nigga cause I ain't tricking
If she worthy Ima' let her fly with me, long distance

Even I look at my diamonds sometimes and kiss em
That's why my x my x and I don't miss her
The way she acting right now I should of pimped her
Throwing shots of liquor on my liver my nigga
Even my niggas know I love em my niggas
And ain't no love for you hoes you hoes crazy
And we ain't neva gone fold we stay faded
Yeah we stay faded

Ain't no water running down my eyes
Ain't no love for the other side
The way these diamonds twinkle all in ya eyeball
I know it should of been a crime dawg by law
And most of these fake niggas they done fell off
I'm raising the stakes nigga and I'm well off
I'm counting that cake trimming my nail off
And when times was hard I move a bail off
And when I'm whipping them lanes I'm in that new spurr
All you niggas some lames softer than new fur
Congratulations to niggas like me dawg
Get money get money and I don't see y'all
I don't see flaw

Wake up and I'm living your dreams nigga
I'm getting crazy money with them new orleans niggas
And only God can judge a nigga holding on the hammer
I could of fucked her from the start and put her on a camera
I kept it hutsle with you bitches kept it real hutsle
You fucking with a gutta nigga so you will suffer
Helicopter flying over ya head
We chop it up live a life that you never
I drive the cars that you never could drive
We fucked the baddest bitches money could buy
Ain't no love lost and ain't no love gained
This young real nigga real pain
What's hatnin

No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension
Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception
A living lethal weapon
I'm the natural selection
Moving in my own eccentric orbit
A rebel amongst conformists
So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto
4 billion miles away
Do a whole week in one day
Live for keeping it real, you already know what it is
I rarely ever speak without something to say
But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how

Thinking how you would be thinking
Im feeling you close
Im dreaming how you would be dreaming
And helping you over
I give what you giving
And I never back out of decisions
I feel what you feeling
And I'm hoping and praying and willing
Im nervous you nervous
You drankin I'm drankin
We rocking
Im talking you talking
Im in it you in it no stopping
Im quiet you quiet
We sit here we looking in silence

Ill be
And I might can't do
What you do
But ill be
Ill see ya
Ill be there

You working I'm working
You sweating I'm sweating
We open the window
The molly won't let us finish
I need it you you need it
And we both fiendin
And I guess thats our agreement
Im naked you naked
And neither one of us trynna look for a blanket
Got questions on questions
About our ex's
Got double cups when we drankin
Your spirit my spirit
Illuminate through our bodies I feel we whole
Eye contact exchanging favors
I guess its better you know

I see you in the morning
I see you in the evening
I seent you in the nighttime
When I though I was dreaming
I be U baby
And I was sitting at home lonely
Wishing you would be there
Thinking to myself
Why I ain't already leave here
Ill see you baby
Ill be U baby

I got a gang of bad bitches and they ready to do
I know these niggas ain't really the truth

I tried not to get too excited I like it
I jumped in that gatti then I pulled out like woo!
Tried not to get too excited, I tried not to get too excited

The penthouse is pending
I fuck her like Penny
She treat me like Lennon
I never wear linen
I'm never gon fit in
Get out of your feelings
I'm back on my business

Back in the coupe, when I jumped in the Bentley it's on
I'm treating these bitches like souvenirs
Fucking these bitches and then we move on
I am just drinking my Actavis
I just need kush for my allergies
I am just fucking this bitch wit another bitch
Now she gon try to go lie to me
I'm looking like I hit the lottery
This molly it keep coming out of me
My astronaut is my astrology
For all of you niggas who doubted me
For all of you bitches who doubted me
Put a hundred them things on the chartered jet
You don't like it you can come get your money back
The weed and that drink got my heart attack
I'm showing no mercy, not showing no mercy for niggas like you
Grab the bandana right round on my head and told niggas that I was the truth
Grab that bandana right out of my head and told niggas that Metro got juuged
I don't be frontin' with niggas unless them niggas be thinkin it's cool

Ain't say the word "murder", but niggas gon ride
They call the police on me everyday I'm standing outside
I got a bomb of that *rah rah*
Watch, I'll serve it all night
Watch me struggle for my enemies
They left my nigga Lonzo under a bunch of leaves
I'm just dealing with the pressure of being rich, nigga
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know I'm balling, the man
I know they'd rather see me broke
When the chain gang bout that blow
Now bitch just want this money
Pussy took me back to coke
And the DA playing dirty
Got my lawyers playing dirty
Got the game playing dirty, ay
Young Metro playing dirty
Yeah, we all playing dirty

Back on my shit

Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lumber
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
You can’t dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you’ll never go

Cop a H3 with the big tires
I got money that will never expire
Took a chance and I became a idol
Who can do what I do, no rival
It’s just me and all my benjamins
Y’all start right, you need to experience this
4 bitches at once, try that now that’s an experiment
Then I don’t wanna be nowhere but inside this music bizz
I work the work and flip the work and bought me a big crib
I could make the first down to first song the bottom of my list
Talking piss poor, broke when you start thinking you ain’t shit
And then you make some millions off a planet that don’t exist

They say you go crazy when you get lonely

Don’t mention even be explained
Bitch I rep that rich game
Close your mouth bitch you can go far
You know what it’s like to roll with a star
I know open doors I can get you chauffeur
We can drive around I don’t touch the wheel
I put swag on you and you taking off, outta here
I got diamonds chains and they put up like souvenirs
I don’t know what to do with money but to stack it up
Came a long way from watching out for them ups drugs
I just seen on drawn the package it’s on the porch
I’m just doing my exercise, finessing the sport

I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

I took the profit from the coke and slapped it right on my feet
I tried to hide a half a million cash, it took me some weeks
Man, that bitch got some head so good, you gon' swear she ain't got no teeth
I mixed the molly with the lean, now we laid up in a suite
I'm in the hood posted up, I know the police gon' sweep
I keep a hood ho, so I can keep that dough where she sleep
She down for a nigga and she ride with that four-fifth
I put that AK in her name, but I keep it on me
I'm brand new when I step out from my head to my feet
These niggas studying my photos, trying their best to compete
I got a style so outrageous, I come through like a chief
I'm the commander on these streets, all you niggas know me

I put Versace on my denim, I'm a lion at heart
I was selling dope like every day 'til I topped the charts
I serve my same clientele, cause these cars are unmarked
I'm running up to every car before the car even parks
We went from Reebok and Girbauds, now it's Louis Vuitton
You want to be Future, I'll look at you just like you're my son
I got a rap check and all I hang around is ex-cons
And if I ever get in trouble, my bitch gon' pay my bond
I told that bitch I need a yopper and she went to the pawn
And I didn't have to tell her twice, cause it was already done
These niggas showing out for me, so now they ordering up ones
Been on some futuristic shit, now I'm back where I begun

Put the codeine in the Sprite, and then I'll have me a drank
Smelling like a pound of loud when I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp, in the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign, and I'm cool as you think
You need to turn it to the max if you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club, but she's leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coupe, getting some head from a slut
And she's catching everything, she won't spit it back up
I bought that bitch some red bottoms, cause she's down for the kid
And she owns so many guns, she's worse than Billy the Kid
I put that semi-automatic in her name and she's with it
When you pull up with that cash, she's going to serve you them fishes

They say money is the root of evil
I say money is the reason why I'm so rude to people
Ten women on a date and I'm treating nigga
I gotta say my grace I'm eating on you pussy niggas
Uh, I got more money then a principle
I graduated from the streets now I'm invisible
Everybody wanna be me cause they can't see me
Everybody wanna join cause they can't beat me
They say my swag get sick and I need treatment
And these niggas can't see me like a young Stevie
I brought my Ray Charles locs and that good smoke
I went to straight to the top but he went broke

Stevie Wonder, Stevie Wonder
Black shades, I can't see you, Stevie Wonder
I'm a living legend just like Stevie Wonder
Diamonds sticking on my wrist just like Stevie Wonder
You niggas never see me y'all like Stevie Wonder

Stevie Stevie please believe me
You gon never see me
I got more ammo than Gilbert Arenas
I'm hydro leaning
Astronomical
Check the chronicles
Paul McCartney
My shades the darkest
I can't see no artist
Salute the sergeant
I got a broader horizon
While you continue starving
My closet like four garages
Im G5 classified
An i got your baby mama so mesmorized
She done sucked the kid off several times
And still ain't seen my eyes
Im so in Pluto
I dont walk cause i just float
Rolling like on a boat
And i can play the piano
I counted so many Euros
I had to get a translator for my bitch cause she dont speak no englo
Church!

I beat another case I feel like Gotti did
I was born in the mob I feel like Gotti kids
My ice killed the club get a body bag
And I ain't talking luggage but I gotta lot of bags
Stupid, stupid swag on 'em
Crazy, crazy cash on 'em
Shit is gettin' contagious money might just have a rash on it
It's Guwop in that new drop
And I'm coming back like 2Pac
You niggas don't see me like a blind man
I forgot the time about two clock
First day I came home I been going, going gone
Walking around bumping everybody
Cause I can't see I just hear about it
Live a crazy life and you can read about it
That 4-5 I can't leave without it
I need black shades I can't see without it
If you talk about it then be about it

Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
That money got my mind blown, money got my mind blown
Money got my mind blown blown blown blown

The feds tapping phones so I talk in codes
The shit jumping out the gym I ain’t talking pros
Polo on my draws, Bentley in my drive way
I was in the trap when you was on Myspace
Money on my mind state, increase the crime rate
Pinky Ring so big you can see it on the blind day
Car game irate, we park outside
SS on it and that’s..for south side
Outside pulling, duice and the juices
Two two cups on me, shout out to Houston
We got a problem Houston, they take on style they boostin'
They Lame Man, they hoes knew it
They lame man, they hoes knewit

Future - Billie Jean...Reincarnated

Get headaches everyday but yu can't tell how hard I go

Don't have no idea how the haters try to interfere
For what yu done built up to this point at yo career
When yu ridin in the rarri swervin' thru traffic with yo diamonds
With glamour and glitz cause all the shit do is remind me
Bad karma I put in when I was grindin'

Baby it's the way you stand

You got me in a trance girl you got me in a trance

Ever since I seen you think you put me out my misery
I'm not concerned with your companion or your history
Cause everytime we're together, I feel the chemistry
I touch your hand, I touch your heart and I might touch your mind
You can't deny the feeling that you're feeling when it's right
I tried to fight it, tried to hide it, swear I tried denying it
Don't have to be with you girl I just wanna stand beside you

During she not at church

And if you ever feeling weak, I make you stronger everyday
And I just wanna see you smiling, and I'm willing do whatever it gonn take

You got Franklins, then I need 'em
I might just have to freeze her
She gon' pledge her allegiance
To Freeband Gang she believe in
Making movies like Steven
A foreign bitch from New Zealand
Her friend don’t even speak English!

Smoking purp it got the whole car filled

With a good connect, you can jug 100 thousand

I keep a pocket full of money anytime I'm stepping out

I dress up in Jimmy, and got it cheap like Wendy
Ain’t got a driver that ending, Ima push to the limit
I take highway chances, with these rap advances
I got mouths to feed and I ain’t leaving them stranded
I go head on with the that paper like a bull
Bitch I’m Tony in my city I got pull
55 Chevy and it got them doors
I don't wanna drive it, got he stack put up
I'm an antique owner, and I'm as hot as a sauna
Coming straight from the corner selling kush marijuana
Put my hood on TV, look at those shoes on me

Fuck it, mask off

Real shit, I am who I am, Future
I‘m addicted to money, I’m addicted to women, hey
You my number one no matter what though, hey

I ain’t mean to hurt you girl
I ain’t mean to hurt you now
Now, I ain’t mean to hurt you girl

I shouldn’t have lie to you, I know, I know, I know
I din’t even wanna say bye to you
You know your nigga ride babe
I even feel the past babe
I’m gonna get it, yes I will

That was never meant to be my intentions
I ain’t do it on purpose girl
I just had to take a while to handle my bizness
No more neglecting girl
You my best friend and you know how we do
Tripping on me cause I’m in another city
But when I come back home, baby I wanna see you
I could cop that Gucci you still say that ain’t enough
I could give you money for your hair and your nails
Just still tripping start acting up
Why you think I’m lying? I’m on the radio, fuck the rumors
Sick of hearding you a pitiful maneuvers
The one I make you say where didy go to …
I just gotta go and do a video with Future
I know it’s hard to forgive and forget
About the time that you saw me with a girl in the car
You think I’m fucking everybody
But I be on the grind when I be up in the world
I’m a star, I want you to be a part of my astrology
Cause I had to learn that you was a part of me
So I hope you accept my apology
So I wanna say, baby I’m sorry

I shouldn’t have lie to you

Whoa, I play them speakers
People we develop hear my voice
Ain’t even see my face
I’m on the paper chase
I got you round my chase
I got you in my plans
I let you blow them bands
You my biggest fan
When them thang I did
You were just like my twin
When I’m lying to you
It’s like I’m lying to my friends
You ain’t gonna never leave
It ain’t what I tell myself
No matter how much I fucked up
I got your back to deal
What is love with a nigga with a heart of steel
Ain’t got no trust for no ho
That’s how I live
When it’s bout the crib
And got an extra condo
I couldn’t tell you bout the stripper
That was going psycho

I made some money but I wanna make some more
I'm for the best friend, I wonder, you should know
You see the rarri, you wonder how fast he go
These real diamonds if you wonderin’ why it glow
Aye, we be ballin’ all summer
And we be hustlin' all winter
And you have no idea
What it takes to be a winner
I know you wonder...

The way I feel is make these niggas choke
Until this shit is painful and it’s impossible to cope
The only magnifying glass I look through is a scope
Snap back leanin' - lyin' face, dangle from my rope
Get to know the meaning
Me and Future, chopper in my coat, while we both be leanin’
Fuckin’ bitches, sloppy on a boat, While my homies sleepin’
Picking up all of this money like it’s only dough I’m sweepin’
Grippin’ up all of this money like you know we only eatin'
Grabbin' up every bag, fuck the talk, we beastin'
Your memory is really gramp, why waste time competin’?
And I know you thinkin' it’s funny - close your mouth
I'm only here to get this money, the fuck you talkin’ ‘bout?
And never doubt we gettin' this dough ‘til it hurts your head
‘Til my accountants fall asleep while they count the bread

I'm doing push ups on the money, dealer tags still on ‘em
Watch when he pull up on ‘em, all the ladies push up on him
Doin' curls with the money, bench press two million
Pull up on ‘em, Rolls Royce, thinkin’ like ten million
Never answer my phone, only pick up when that money ring
Sit up on the stairwell, look at that money ring
Tits around the town, workin’ my cow, ankle weight
Ship it in, lots of pounds, I don’t need an anchor, wait
Break it down, stretch it out, punch it up, work it out
I remember pullin’ up, now all I do is pick it up
First we train the money, it come every day
Thank goodness for my hustle, thank God I got my muscle
I'm ‘bout that cream, a bitch’ll never milk me
Fuck being clean, I’d rather be filthy

I keep it interesting
For her, it’s no finessing
She love my style so when she shop, she let me do the dressing
She shoulda learned her lesson, fucking with me is a blessing
Infatuated with my presence, now she feel neglected
I bought her so many presents, it’s one to break there
She been a1 with a nigga since the first day
Just to pack it, she gon’ pack it in her purse

I tried to make up for it, put her in a Beamer
I bought that bitch a crib, been some years since I’ve seen her
I know I’m coming there and hey, I might need her
A gift and a curse when you’re fucking with a hustler
She know I got a curse, she just want me to fuck her
And you still hurt me when I lie to her

Can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her

Sipping purple, sipping yellow, 24 out today
Smoking on that California, first thing when I awake

Astronaut forever nigga even in my afterlife
Rest in peace to Amy Winehouse I’m bout to take flight

That's Gucci on Gucci, from head to my feet
I'm.. off the money like I snorted P
I turn up, I turn up, it's no one can compete
I broke the knob off and they vanished, capisci?
I can't see you, even though you see me
I'm back on my one-two, hooking up Peru
More money, more problems, what am I to do?
I'm inside the zoo, I'm gone on that screw
Guerrilla warfare, chopping it loose!
I hop in the Coupe, 200 on dash
My bitch very bad, my money come fast
The bottle's on fire like the 4th of July
Designer my eyes, designer my hoes
Designer my clothes, we pouring up fours

If it's OG, that's that loud pack!

Aye, The streets callin, I'ma pick up hold up hold up

I'm selling that good 'caine, got dope under my fingernail
Puttin bitches on detail, just so I can eat well

I had to cook it up myself and bring it all back
It hit the block every day, nigga run up them stacks
I put that kush in my lungs, I count up chips
Water water water, bag up them zips
Work your wrist, cook that fish, 36, in a brick
Get a flock and make a fist, get a pot
Find a bitch, open shop, this ya spot, at her house, trap it out

Stacking cake like leggos, all that work is paid for
We're cashing out and lay low, pockets in the kitchen
More touchdowns than Ocho, we don't never close
24, uncold, ice like super bowl
Talk to migo, tell him bring that twerkalator
Make sure the fish A-1, Make sure this fish
You gotta have that clean when you remix
I could put a brick together like a puzzle
I'm in the middle of the street with j's' in a huddle
My clientele love me, I don't have to touch em
This money coming in, nigga I can't trust ya

I burnt up two cell phones, just this week
I'm starting to work off the boost since my mix-tape got leaked
It was soft, now it's hard like concrete under your feet
I turned my grandma house to a drug store, we're serving all week
Dope is out of here, I got that Earl Malone coke jumping out the gym
Smoke up smoke up smoke up, if you a smoker
I got that crack for you in my toaster
If you get too close, sir, I'ma have to roast ya
Have the cash in your hand when you approach a roller

Yeah, ey

Pineapple phantom, Promethazine on me, get loaded
I told you I'm ready to get it, my nigga, I'm focused

No mercy, no manners, no glory, no story, I'm very important
Protect the sources, I was dippin' the fork, I could jump in the Porsche
None of my dreams was reality just a few years ago, homie was starvin'
I feel the weight on your shoulders, I need to blaze up the doja
You need to blaze up the doja, I gotta keep my composure
I gotta keep on goin', come and lay with you early in the mornin'
And when the sun rise, I know it's killing you
I ain't down with you no more
You done caught feelings, you can't take it no more
Me coming through, smashing, leaving right back out the door
I could tell it's somebody else you spending your time with
I'm just tryna find me somebody else I can grind with
You want me acting like a nigga on some nine to five shit
Ain't tryna treat you like no side bitch, but you my bitch
Diamonds on your ankle, baby, whoa
I been in the kitchen cooking all night

Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money
Even if I fall, I'm gonna land on a bed of hundreds
I know something, mama's life will never flourish
I swear to Lord, I just left the bank
Hungry for more, wearin' designer galore
Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got this fight in me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin' shit, Rocky Balboa

Give me a set of keys or a melody and I'll go crazy
I'm blowin' trees in my fatees ain't no Fugazzi
Even in them A1's I'm sure I got the same bipolar
The super charger going stupid hard, now I'm pullin' up in the drops homie
You ain't never been this high
Good thing I got, I'mma own me a car lot
Spit fire to the studio, just like a trap spot, I've been fly
Ask cop guy, no lie
Went from getting a house bust to bustin' a stadium
Only take a day off, getting them Benjamins
Runnin' this trick, I'm runnin' up in the mills
It ain't low key and that's new lingo, new millennium
I'mma spit a verse, I drew my 10 and i don't take this life for granted
Blood sweat and tears ain't just happening
I'm a free band nigga with a plan

With my back against the rope, selling dope, baking coke
Child support, no support
I still had hope, I always spoke
Banished into existence
I never lost faith, I kept my place
Paper chase every day
It's we sensei but it's why I stay
And I go ape behind this cake
I stay laced, look at my face
I can't see you, money in the way
I'm up to date in outer space
A new regime, a brand new day
I'm infamous, got lion trace
What I'm tryna say I'mma keep that fire inside me til my heart decay

The gift, the curse, I done been through the worst
They let the real for real surface
100 million dollars is my only damn purpose

You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I cook me one I cook up a half a key
Now every time I buy a car I trick it out with the fee

You should've left me inna blind
You should've left me Ray Charles
You shouldn't've never let me get on the track with the Drum Squad
You shouldn't've never let me hit the sack, I'm fucking your broad
You shouldn't've never let me hit the studio with the bar
You shouldn't've never let me do it, you know I grind hard
You shouldn't've never let me whip it, turn myself to a star
You shouldn't've never let me struggle, You should never did it
You shouldn't've never ever show me how to remix the fishes
You should've never fucked me over, no you should've never done it
I'mma send them Puerto Ricans through your way and show you who run it
You shouldn't've never let my buy the Benz and get it fully loaded
You shouldn't've never let my dig a whole and then let me owe it
I'mma forge out my wrist
I'mma ice out my chain
After I leave the dealership I'mma go see Johnny Dang
I might just whip me a kilo
Then go flex mi amigo
I'mma wrap a whole bail up like a taco burrito

Cause when I made a mil' I made another one instantly
I got foreign bitches on my line and bitches right next to me

Send a gift to my Gods, for blessing my recipe
Turn that soft to that hard, like a dick to Penelope
I'mma king of this game, overruling the mini-me
Can show you the recipe, still can't produce the melody
A magical mentally turn 3 minutes to 30g
The work of Achilles, breakdown the sound of the synergy
My prago so yayo like I went down to South Italy
I rally through ATL, then shoot it through Tennessee
I cook it myself, no middleman or the in-between
I fall from a strange river and stroke through the industry
Im so turnt up, can't comprehend what they tellin' me
You once was the plug but now don't need what you sellin' me

Cause when I made a mil I made another one instantly

I got a house full of Jacksons like my name Tito
Threw more bones than Tebow, caught more bones than T.O
Word on the street that boy Dolph got that recipe
That's why jump flights and greet my plug frequently
2 hoes on my iPhone say they wanna come go to sleep with me
I saw my first hundred thou' and it did something to me mentally
Smokes that come from Compton, my sneakers come from Italy
I'm that same nigga from Castalia remember me ?
Shouldn't've shown me the game cause now it ain't no looking back
I'm in the last spin lap
My boy Drumma he cooking crack
Call my socket
Got a sack
Spent a quarter thing of sacks
Cop a drop and park it in the hood and make that right back

Young nigga, y'all nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, Aye move that dope

Movin' them squares and them bales, servin' the rawest of yayo
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up
Leanin' over, over to the side, I whip me a four way to a nine
The dirty, the money is homicide and my recipe can't be televised

Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better
Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'till the bezel break?
YUGHH! Look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Made it through to the other side, now nothing's big as my ego, Push

Young nigga move that dope, boy
P move that ho
When I move that rope, I could move your ho
When she hear the motherfucker know from her throat
When I sing la-la-la, LaFerrari
Red-on-red like the Imperial Army
Mamis, I am sorry, that was just my ego on me, uh
Women's my army, surrounded they always be on me
Just want a piece like they Gandhi
Close my eyes, pray to the omni-nificent
Just to wake up the insomni-niacs
Let me help you lift your shit
Get it right and ignite your shit
See it, build it, sell it, IPO but don't swipe your shit

Ah, ah
Assembling a riot
Chanting and circling the fires
Heard behavior, can’t keep it quiet
Kinetic energy a thousand times higher

Holy shit it’s working, we all got in
Holy shit it’s working, now look at my friends
Holy shit it’s working, it’s bitter to the taste
Holy shit it’s working, we dancin' in place
What goes up must come down
What goes in must come out
You surrounded, dawg, come on look around
I was zen, but no not now
Holy shit it’s working, no more trail of tears
Holy shit it’s working, the prophecy is here
Holy shit it’s working, we’re wreckin' this bih
Holy shit it’s working, one thousand percent

In the mirror, there’s a hero
One, zero, zero, zero
Hey, hey, hey, one thou'
Git, one thou'
Hunnud, 1000
Uh, 1000

My girl don’t wear shoes unless they cost over a thousand
Brand new coupe cost couple hundred thousand
Got some models in the bed and they coming by the thousand
Them young goons never sleep, they somewhere prowling
Everywhere we go they tote a chopper by the thousand
Champagne in the club costs thousands
We got gold by the bar, that’s thousands
Ferragamo belt will hit me for a even thousand
We can gamble right now, bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Count the money up in all hundreds, all thousand
I’m too rich to talk if ya ain't talking thousands

Holy shit it’s working, I’m feeling like a saint
Holy shit it’s working, my feel sorry, can’t
Holy shit it’s working, we painted our face
Holy shit it’s working, the rainbow angst

Act like you don’t really hear a lot
You can pretend when you are
Karma makes sure tears will drop
You’ll be wishing that your year will stop
It will be a thousandfold one, zero, zero, zero, dot

My hippie homie told me take a flight

On my metro, I was working, I was serving
I go cutthroat, when I'm down and I'm hurting
This a special moment, and we taking full advantage
100 dollar Future, I'll pass them out to all my family
I got this one bitch, I'll put her in the red bottoms
When you dumb rich, and you came from the bottom

Tell me the combination, I'm 'bout to fill it up with racks
I don’t take no vacations, I ain't got no time to relax
I'm flying up the Doja, 9-1-1, them the horses is inside the motor
When the money come, hater come and you keep some soldiers
They gonna knock a nigga off for you
Just to say they told you
I'mma get the office in the building to make my quota
I can't never have no feelings for bitches, they so rogue-ish
Trying to come to the club with a nigga to get exposure
I'mma buy shawty a bag, I feel sad for her
She can't come around a rich nigga rocking a Coach
I done beat a couple cases and did'n show up at court
Everything Versace, Medusa including my locs

Chiefin' on some good herb
Let’s go and fire up
Black Woodstock!

Fu-Fuck yo plug come shop with me
Its a line at the door like the DMV
For the next 30 minutes its bricks for free
For the next half an hour its bricks on me

Traphouse with bout 20 kitchens
Lookin' like a robbed Lennox
Pull up in a pretty Bentley
Damn this cost a pretty penny
Yeah we sexin in the city
I whip her she fulfill my wishes
Awww I dream of genie

My chuck taylors got spikes on top
Got a polo horse on the side of my sock
Them whole thangs go for 30 a whop
Got purple lean inside my pop
My black shades, I'm rock starred out
I turned the block into a drop
Free bricks 3x
Ima zone six nigga hittin licks
I got dope inside my piss
I got ice on side my wrist
I got ice on top of my hands
And I stay screaming free Bands
I got all these damn white bitches
Lookin' like the Ku Klux Klan
And I can't wait to kill they mouth
Ima young nigga comin out the south Heyyyy

I'm fucked up inside, put more lean inside my system
Every day I tell God I wish Snoop was still living
I ain't forgot about ya nigga, Free band gang winning
I do shit for Lonzo, a junkee stabbed my nigga
That could of been me serving, you don't know the half my nigga
The weight I'm dealing with, I just might start killing shit
I hit the studio vibing, spitting the realest shit
I shouldve seen a psychiatrist, I was built for this
On the road of riches ain't about a bitch
No DVS's, no wink & kiss, paid dues are overdue

It ain't all about the glitter
But I'm grinding like a blender
I keep it G who keep it G with me
It ain't all about these bitches, death to you snitches
I'm on a countership with Ceelo, Rest in peace to Prime
You niggas wanna be LO but you can never be LO

Thousand dollar shots on my face, I'm coolin' it
I rock the gold, keeping it basic it ain't bout the gliss
I want the type of check I can make my niggas rich
Alot of people talk that loyalty don't know what it is
Have you ever been so broke you don't even wanna live?
So fucked up to the point that funerals can share the tears
Gotta grind so fucking hard the shit bring you to tears
Forgot to call my momma on her birthday God bless the kid
Phone barely ringing now it's ringing till it's dead
I'm bout to run dem m's up mutha fuck the feds
Got my money in a wall, ain't fucking up my bread
I had a talk with the Most High and this is what He said

When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold

Walk like a ball player, talk like a migo
Watch worth a bale and my neck on a kilo
Guacamole stuffed in the TRUs you can see notes
Long wave racks on that alley where I trick her
Strong in my system I can barely even see ya
Young fly mamasita slice it like pizza
Heard she was a diva and i did her with my people
Didn't your wifey tell you how we fucked and had a threesome?
Didn't your wifey tell you how the ice shine brightly?
Didn't she tell you 'bout the Audemar or the Breitling?
She told me how the diamonds had her dripping wet excited
Smashed her in the studio and kicked her out politely

Yeah, I don't gliss, I shimmer got them hoes in a Venom
Finna fuck 'em 'til I can't remember could of been January, May, June or December
A1 Freeband gang, nigga I'm a member
Get money in the fall, spring, summer and the winter
Been around the world on a gangster adventure
California so loud you can smell the picture
VVS's on meth, you can see the crystals, my neck in a blizzard

Military training got my Gucci army hat on
Gucci belt holding up the TRUs that I have on
Gwualla in my pocket poking out like Offset
Fuck my bitch friend have my old girl upset
Old school Corvette '65 pace car
Money going round and round fast like NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt sponsored by the bud
Ice light up cause I'm sponsored by the drugs
La familia nigga I'll explain later
100 thousand on the whip and I didn't have to save up
Movie star, rock star, cocaina flavour
I love the money so much it's hard for me to cake up

I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, now I spend it quick
Ain't fuck up on the cash with my bitch
Order up that Lambo, put me on the list

Order up the Lamborghini, put me on the list
All the fettuccine, I can clone a bad bitch
Take her out of Bakers, now she shop at Jeffrey's
I'm on a roll, getting money, got a bad recession
What type of nigga you know in the middle of the hood worth some tickets?
What type of nigga you know sell out shows play with fishes?
Gucci, Louie, Prada, that's the way a nigga kick it
I got a whole bird on me, nothing to be specific
Ice, ice, ice like I jumped in the Pacific water
Money, money, money and that shit coming in digits
I got 50 cent on me on my way to Walt Disney
That's a whole 50 racks, young nigga with the business

I got that fettuccine on me, tell me what you see
You can't be in Aldo standing next to me
Out them bitches pronto, out that R&B
Hit Paris for that poncho, the G's sound like Z's
Givenchy, Veuve Clicq, menage a trois, c'est la vie
I sell it all, he mail it all
Slow gift wrap, need a Christmas card
Champagne pour, I christen y'all
You niggas hating
I'm lifting off in private jets
We peeling out
In them Porsche Panameras that we wheeling out

I look a bitch in her ass 'fore I look a bitch in her eye
I see the bitch in y'all swag, I give a fuck if y'all fly
I'm cheap though, I'm staying paid, I'mma make it rain
And I'mma take the train, I'm Latino, got razor blades
Okay chico but it ain't to shave, I got pesos, I got pesos
Bad hoes by the caseload and she gonna get a face full
And she gonna get a face full so pardon if the kid narcissistic
I'm shining bright, it'd be hard to miss it, I heard y'all in Target
Thrifting while I'm buying out the whole Garment District
No room in the whole room, don't clean clothes
I hit show room, she's anorexic, no food
So it's half the check up in Noble, I got bad habits and good habits
Cheat a lot cause I'm good at it, fuck a bitch for her bank account
When I'm done with it, the whole hood have it

All-white bitch to match these all-white Louies
Millionaire frames, hand made - I'm just coolin'
Popcorn kush, no strings on ya coochie
Pop a DVD in - rollin', cruisin'
Yeah yeah - yeah
Up there - where?
Wristwear - cold
Chandelier

You see me? I see me too
I just bought my girl a new pair of Jimmy Choos
I got a .35 stashed in my right shoe
I don't wear one, that's why they call me two

Getting to the money, I keep my sprite dirty
Mama say I'm crazy, I spent 300 on a skully
Shawty wanna go, her girlfriend frontin
So I flashed a bankroll now her girlfriend coming
What's up to my 'migos, yea my migos call me tito
I got swagger like a d boy, far as kilos I need three more
No I'm not from B-more but I know that I can be more
And I'm so high right now, I make my pilot take a detour
Uh - I'm in beast mode, got Atlanta streets sold
Talking re-ing up when I say I gotta reload
Easier than saying my alphabets or shooting free throws
Cause like A-B-C, D-E-F - bitch I'm on my g code
Playing with her g spot, you playing with her pee hole
Shoutout to my bank account, it got a lot of zero
Pretty hair
Fendi stores
Lenox square

Everything black, bout to kill niggas on sight
Everything fly, bout to take flight out of sight
Drinkin' on lean, two cups styrofoam
Cause too many bitches wanna call my phone
Blowin' on strong, sippin' on 'tron
Throwin' up money, rippin' my zone

Abu, it’s your boy!
Oh, DJ X-Rated!
Hey man I know you going to re-d up on the sprites already
I have two cases in the bag already dirty
Good, you need to go get those
Cause every time a freeband gang come in here
You know we got to turn up
Hm? turn up?
Man astronaut status man, turn up
Turnip greens aisle five on the left you know that
Man I-
What the fuck?
Turnip green?
Man I’m not talking about no motherfucking turnip green!
I’m talking about turn up man!
Turn up?
Turn up, turn up?

Said I'll swap it out
I'm swapping everything out here brand new

I swapped out my true religions
Put on my robin jeans
I swapped out dat clean sprite
Mixed it with codeine
I swapped out it old school
Pulled up in dat new thing
I swapped out a Puerto Rican
And now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame
Now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe
Cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe
Make my pockets fatter
Swapped out dem vv ones
Now I got better carots

I went psycho with dat sprite
I went a drug addict with dat sprite
I Got hoes dat like to dike
But to tell you the truth they fly like kites
I got bad bitches who write
Went to space and took a flight
Yeah I'm fly but ain't no kite
Cause they're too short for my life
I'm on Pluto
You on Earth
I had burberry at first
Now it's Pluto on my shirt
I don't go crazy
I'll go berserk
Had to maro hard top
Pull da rari with da vert
I'm the king in my hood
Aye da globe is my turf
See me rocking diamonds
You know the diamond's very bright
Had to swap out the mid
Then we start sellin white
I was true religion saggin
Now dem robins on me nice
Paid the cash in, cash now
All I do is swipe

I swapped out a portal beacon
Swapped out that ratchet ho
Now I got better caarots

I swapped my Louis scarf for Alexandra Macqueen
I just brought a sprite and it's no longer clean
Was a true religion kid that I designed for my jeans
Hey I run ATL
Man I feel like a king
I'm red bottom walking when I walk on the fly
Rosalina popped a pill
Now I'm no longer tired
Marijuana in my system
You can see it on my eye
I've got a pocket full of hundred man
I feel like plies
I was old school shopping
Na da rari what matters
I once trip off light
Now I'm in Pluto forever
Yellow Stone, White Stone
Stepping up on my bezel
I vvs the face
Took out canary yellows

I swapped out my true religion
I swapped out dat old school

Niggas ain't aiming at your chest, shooters aim straight for the top
I don't even wanna fuck these hoes no more man all I want is the top
Even in the winter time we cop these drops and drops in the top
Came from the projects and got on the grind shot straight to the top
We on top, we on top, we on top
We on top, we on top
They sleepin' on the seventh floor, thinking no no
They got 28 floors, we on the 28th floor
We on top

Lil Mexico the army, Freeband the marine
Some million dollars in the building when I'm on the scene
Flacko what it is, you know it's all love
Back to back Lambo, me and big cuz
Scooter got the 'Rari making juugs and catching plays
Two cup, filled up, drankin' on Aid
Throwin' money off stage, standing on stage
Won't shop at Fifth Plaza, go shop in LA
International liking all my freaks exotic
1 or 2 commas on the tags that I'm popping
Gucci, Fendi, Dolce, YSL, picka closet
You can die paid, we got one, two options

28th floor I got 28 sold
Whole thangs only, ain't no 28th though
Brick on top of brick they go for 28 for
Bales on retail, 400 I let 'em go
All these freebands I ain't gotta change no more
Camaro outta oldschool, I bought off selling dope
Bitch I'm Young Scooter, do what the fuck I want
All this damn money, nigga everything for show
To count a quarter ticket, G told me it's a go
Hustle, juug, and stack it is the only thing I know

My shades on
My ice glow
On VVS, drippin I got mojo
Fuck them old hoes, I got new hoes
Bitch on Insta turnt up in the presidential house
I get top, I get guap, I love to get both
Drop head, what a time, Future gotta do the most
Astronaut smash off I gotta get ghost
President Amigo, hasta luego, send your pesos
We on the jet eatin' breakfast
On some fly nigga feel like I got feathers

Comin down flexin' in a Transformer

Brick on my wrist, I made a coup to a trick
I took that ho from that nigga, and I made her my bitch
Gettin' lyrical signs, when I rock it I'm buyin'
Go rock custom made Pluto gear, can't even find
I turn the club to a zoo, I flip my money Kung-Fu
I comin' down with the flu, I turn one into two
I made a FOE to a team, when it bought my a Benz
I'm a A1-Nigga, all we do is a trance
Going back to the future, right to J.Fox, Nigga
That bitch came to me, and he had to go get her
And we workin' with Either, that's that Nas and Jigga

I wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time

Fucked your sister and your girl at the same damn time
All these diamonds that I rock could make a bitch go blind
Yella ice, white ice at the same damn time
Walkin’ straight through the club, I don’t stand in no line
And my glasses Jimmy Jewels but I got them Gucci shoes
With a Louis belt and Prada bag, I swear I’m so confused
I shop at Vista Lenox Mall in the same damn day
Spendin’ 10k in future, feel the same damn way
Serve my baby momma brother, got the same ole grind
Sellin’ bricks, sellin’ bales at the same damn time
I get better every year so my flow is like wine
I’m a rapper and a trapper at the same damn time

Whipping white and baking soda, at the same damn time
Puffy got a mansion, bitch I got the same damn kind
Went and bought two sixty twos, at the same damn time
Rock an AP and a Rolly, at the same damn time
Still selling boy and girl, at the same damn time
Selling cane, getting brain, at the same damn time
All the women say my name, at the same damn time
Letting off two different choppers at the same damn time
Putting down in different projects at the same damn time
Dope money still a object, it's the same damn grind
But I got two platinum artists, at the same damn time
Went and got two Maseratis at the same damn time
Liberace, John Gotti, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, it's the same damn grind
Captain boy, cooking crack, at the same damn time
On my Twitter writing raps, at the same damn time
Getting head counting bread, at the same down time

She on Molly, she with Mary, at the same damn time
We the squad, Young Folarin, out that Maybach Mob
Fuck a tape, fuck your broad
Middle finger up, to the mother fucking law
No days off, Gunplay ball, sick with the cross like DeRon going off
At the same damn time
Shape like a eight, face like a nine
Heard she dancin' at Kamal's, and she make too much to stop
And she stripping, go to college
And they trickin' her deposit
While them bitches always gossip, she busy going shopping
At the same, at the same time
And your girl don't show her face when I be FaceTimin'
SB Nike's, with the grey box
You in the past me and Future on the same watch

All black, khaki jumper, actin' a donkey
At the same damn time, got these bitches poppin' monkey
Metro Zoo in here, with my crew in here
With all these hogs in the game no room for you in here
Limo tints on my shades, skinnies on my blades
Crocodile kicks like my hood the Everglades
Rich forever paid
Do it with no effort, now let's effin' celebrate
Toast and spill the grapes, hoes catchin' vapes
Toe touchin' freaks
She jumped on my pole and did a pole trick for me
Slippin' on ya pimpin' that means more grip for me
Chrome lips on the Forgi's damn near swallowing the street
You owe me, homie have that now
I'm a pull that Gat out now
Must be out your rabbit mind, I'm thuggin', rappin', same damn time

I rock Gucci, I rock Louie, at the same damn time
I shoot you and kill ya homie, with the same damn nine
In kitchen, whippin' blow, it got the same damn crumbs
I need a ho that's like my pro without the same damn mind
At the same damn time, gettin' hit on by a couple hoes
Two big faces on my wrist, boy I got a couple those
I told her I love that pussy, she think we a couple though
And she got a boyfriend but she say he a sucka though
At the same time, pull up like James Bond
In that Aston Martin on these niggas, game time
Fresh ass Mike's, my Rollie on ice
Got bitches on Mollies, they rollin' all night
I be way out in Cali, got hoes of all types
With 80 racks in my pocket, nigga I go in all night

Yeaah Luda is unstoppable, his money is astronomical
Rappers is dillusional and now they talking more shit
Anything is lie when it coming out the mouth of a desperate starving broke Bitch
Choke Bitch, you used to be good but now you’re garbage
My flows is rubbing off just like their fingernail polish
You rappers ain’t got no swag, you need to kill your Fucking stylist
They biting like piranhas then crying to their momma
These Niggas best to call their troops back like Obama
That trash that you’re spitting didn’t faze me, matter of fact your record label still pays me
See Luda never starting shit, I’m always on my grind, but I’ll respond to three rappers at the same damn time

Smoke kush, fuck bitches, That's the way it go
Drink lean, sell dope, That's the way it go
Walk in Fifths and buy the store, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
Buy some ice and ride foreign, That's the way it go
Hit the club and buy the bar, That's the way it go
VIP, we usually stars, That's the way it go

Either way it go, I'ma smoke a pound of kush
Got a redbone on my line, like to fuck wit crooks
She gotta brain on her, suck a good dick and read books
I'll take lil shawty shoppin, cause I like the way she look
I could put up wit her attitude, plus she ain't a stalker
Inside the cup pink, and I'm playing  wit them dolphins
Ridin' fresh as hell, money in the glove compartment
Goin' cross town, to meet the bitch in her apartment
Got my jewelery on monster, flexin in my Burberry
Saks Fifth shoppin', twenty bags I ain't carry em
Jumpin out the Porsche Cayenne, zippin thru traffic
Money, cars, clothes. Young Future living lavish

I rock red diamonds like a maxi pad
And yellow diamonds like a taxi cab
My closet look like a smash and grab
My driveway look like a launching pad
My English broke, so I'm slurring words
Imma zoo keeper, I'm holdin' birds
My swag absurd, can't be put in words
You old rappers, kicked to the curb
Now the way it go, about 3 or 4
I'mma probably leave wit bout 3 or 4
And they followin and they swallowin
I gotta house so big can't find em in
Or I could get a room and just pile em in
Gucci Mane switchin' up the style again
Gotta hunned mill on my mind again
I'm icey bitch, go blind again

Smoke kush, fuck bitches. That's the way it go

Hit it wit the fork, Hit it, hit wit the fork
Ion drink unless it's dirty, and I'm higher than a hawk
White and red tiger stripes, I'm in the Aston Martin
I put the roof inside the trunk, the kush be stinkin' like a skunk
I'm the clouds, just what I want. Today I smoked a hundred blunts
I took this bad bitch to lunch, she been hittin' me for a month
Had to make some time for her, I been busy all this money
If I ain't outta town doing shows, you know what I be on
From Benihana to the Intercontinental draped in stones
Wit a pretty yellowbone, and she hold a nice tone
Got a call and a text, hope it's money on my phone
My bitch flying in from Cali, say her flight 3 hours long

The Movie

Live from hells kitchen its only a few chose
By the time you start getting money my money gon' be more
Check a nigga swagger you niggas shoes old
You couldn't walk and step in my shoes I'm solid as Gold
Rip off your pockets, I'm gutter, go back in your asshole
The bigger the pot get, the drama it come with the money
The trips, the fame, the luxury whips
You talking that rich talk, I cooked up with a pitchfork
Lord forgive me for my sins these niggas need chalk
Your career already dead before you get on
Study my mixtapes, write about my fancy wardrobe
I embrace niggas, I made you a killa
Dope boy superior, Bloody green interior
As the plot thickens you niggas get more serious
Where your comfort come from
Your mom your dad your homies
They lied to ya you barely survivin'
Championship too you ain't coming back alive
The day I stop using Autotune thats when its gone die
Until then I create melodies thats influenced by promethazine
I was chasing bricks before I chased the dream
Plotting on a scheme
I smell the fake I smell the phony I smell the thieves
You can’t get rid of me
I'm a problem to be reckoned with, I'm wrecking shit

Yo whats going on whats going on
Where you at I’m over here at the god damn studio I thought you were gonna pull up
Man I can’t get no sleep I been up a month straight nigga I ain’t slept I been countin' money nigga my knuckles hurt nigga
Man we got to turn up on these niggas man
They think a nigga sleep or something I'm just countin' money
They think a nigga sleep?
Right no sleep
Say no more

Caught a 7 brick nap when I put that on my grandma
Serve a bag of keisha, but I'm always smokin' granddad, yeah
And I put that on my grandma, how quan get that lema?
And I put that on my grandma, yeah
You want that work, I'm pullin' up, I'll send it threw the air
I put that on my grandcousin, I got bricks here

9 millimeter on my brothers keys
Brand new pair of boots, servin' out the wraith
Trappin' out the reaper, bought a p again
Popped a gram of molly, workin' on some thotties
Sacrificed the plug and went and bought another plug
We out here scrapin' nigga, aye, fuck the great depression
I hope ya learned ya lesson, cookin' for ya body
Hotter than a jolly, pick ya pot right by the fire
Turnin' on the fire, lean it to the side
36 bezel coat and you didn't even know what it cost ya
Got that migos collar

Off 7 thousand keisha, but I'm always smokin' granddad, yeah

Rack rack city bitch....
Get get smacked silly bitch
I'mma give ya'll 50 bars on this one.....Ready?

So what they tryna hate for
They know I'm gettin' paid more
And when I'm in the club, everything I drink is paid for?
You left the picture and missed everything u stayed for
The game gettin' tough but this the shit that I was made for
So act up, best believe you gettin' smacked up
Pedal to metal I ain't lettin' niggas catch up
And we could match up homie we gonn smoke too
Cause it's our time and we gonn shine like we supposed too
I told you, I'm the illest with this mic shit
Spit it off the top, I'ont even gotta write shit
My tight shit sounds the best when I be dumb high
Cause I get Harvard brain and I'm far from an alumni
You dumb guys, I do rap and soccer shit
You don't see me glow? I'm bout to blow like a rocket ship
U talkin' shit I think its best that u dip and hide
Cause when I start to flow it be wet like a slip n slide
I'm gettin high u can tell my eyes is bloodshot
Take a lotta pictures but I stay away from mugshots
I do my thing boy I always do my shit well
Rest in peace to em but I'm bout to smoke a Big L
Brain twisted, soul being lifted
You should hand over the mic like Taylor Swift did
See what the piff did, feel like I'mma die slow
Hit it and a nigga spit fire like I'm Spy-ro
My eyes low, compliments cause I rhyme well
I'm runnin' in your crib like I'm Kramer off of Seinfeld
You sleepin' boo? I slide thru, like PeekaBoo
You frozen in shock now ya nickname is Pikachu
Jeez - I swear I'll try and take it easy
A nigga need a wife but need some bitches who are sleazy
For when I'm feelin' low, they know exactly how to please me
To all my niggas listenin' I know ya fuckin' sees me
Yeaa
Cause I got bitches on the side
That'll hop on the dick, if I feel like gettin' sidetracked
They ride that til I nut and then I pass out
Then I give em food and and cab and kick they ass out...
That's how a player do
And I'mma player who
Loves gettin' brain so shout outs to all my players too
And they say hate the game not the player boo
But bitches doin' circles like muhfuckin dreidel do
And I'll shake up the whole damn place
My punchlines'll punch lines in ya whole damn face
I smoke weed and sip goose til I start to get loose
Fake niggas gimme dap, I leave em hanging no noose, damn
You can't battle? well I'll kill him myself
A registered sex offender how I'm feelin' myself
You feelin' the wealth, well I got paper in sight
A lotta niggas can't stand how I'm rapin the mic
But all this herb got me lookin' like a china man
Everybody know I rap so I rhyme when I can
Try and name somebody with as many lines as ya man
Time is money guess I gotta lot of time on my hands
And I got paper in my pockets I'm just achin' to burn
N you could shine when its ya time but keep waitin' ya turn
Cause its mine n I'mma grind til this paper I earn
And ion preach but ill teach til they blatantly learn
Understand I'mma boss, I could never take an off day
Cause I'mma be a star who got bucks, no latte s
Papi what the ladies love to call me
Cause they love when I get it up like wall street
I'm good lookin', rhyme tight, and I flow nuts
Krispy Kreme workers even sayin' that my dough nuts
I go nuts boy....

How many niggas you know can just hop in the Benz?

I ride around my city like the 2 3
I’m coming out the wrapper like a new me
I know theyre geeking, getting a’s on every record
I came here with the gold but ima set the record
I’m ai with the game i didn’t come to practice
And yanet garcia sitting on my mattress

With alum from jack and jill and they be acting ratchet
Life is not a bitch but I be on the beach
With a bitch, and a corona, and a bit of weed

So many looking, I tell every other one to freeze
I buy em every bottle just to tell them that its free
They asked me if I’m mixed and i say yes in living color

Just a 'nother sad love song waitin' to happen

Strapped with that flame and he ready to bust a brain
You can't tell the homie nothing, he done felt too much pain
He don't care nun about no fame, he addicted to the game
Some niggas rob, some niggas slang, do whatever to maintain
Travel all the way to Waco, get them numbers for the low-low

Body flooded up with ice name a rapper cleaner

Turnt myself to a astronaut, if you believe you can achieve
I want ya spot homie numero uno
And I brought a check with me bigger than a sumo
Blood Sweat Tears inside this rap as I flow
I know some niggas dead and gone want the best for me
And I know some niggas living praying for the worst for me
I seen darker days I know this ain’t the end for me
That’s why every chance I get cuz I’mma give em hell
Me and my niggas we the last real niggas left
Me and my niggas we the realest niggas left

It’s like my body made of diamonds, I can’t stop shinin’

International future don’t follow my footsteps
Every pair of Jordan’s done came out I had em ‘fore they hit the shelf
I ain’t gave away I’m donating Ralph Lauren
I had every pair of skippers from the green to orange
Yellow Blue White three stripes Adidas suits
All day I dream about selling dope like shootin’ hoops
One day you dreamin’ then you wake up to reality
First you lose your heart then your true friends disappear
I was already shinin’ fore I got here
I told myself I’ll get my feet off ground I’m goin’ outta here
I’m taking some people I never would thought even be here
Everything I went thru it’s a purpose why I’m still here
Hard work perservere keep them people in your ear and them people in your rear
Me and my niggas we the last real niggas here

I Can't answer questions for these fake ass niggas

Broke up the next day with her, told her she can keep it

...down in the hood, need to come catch this fade
You acting hard on SnapChat, come catch this fade
I'mma have Kendall Jenner going crazy
I'mma have mama Kris tryna save me
They tryna get me off the syrup

Most of this shit smoke and mirrors

Don't believe what they tell you Smoke and Mirrors!!
Half that shit they sell you Smoke and Mirrors!!
You know you gotta hit Smoke and Mirror!!
You niggas can't be serious!!

They gas you up like AMACO and fill your head with lies
Tell the team that got you here they ain't worthy for the ride
You need to cut em off immediately they not good for you
They tell you anything you wanna here but its up to you to know whats really going on thinks of what the fakest
Everything that glitters ain't gold have patience
They rather see you fall
They don't wanna see you ball
They gone try they damn best to come between in you all
Put the picture in the media bout the drama
Don't know heart or work it took from them summers
Now they wanna add you on Twitter like they yo kin
Nigga I know you ain't my friend

I camoflauge my jacket blendin' in with the snakes
I got to be on drugs just to deal with the fake
This shit going on in the industry ain't no way am relate
You got to keep it real with the niggas that's around you
The ones that who was there before the fame, the ones that keep you grounded
You gotta show love to the hood in every county
Every City, every gurl a kissin' baby, hugging mothers
Them old folks they fuck with Future like they young again
Ain't no way Imma let you hold me back I'm going in
My top off go and kicks some rocks off nigga fucking with a young boss

Metro in this muthafucka nigga
I don't need no autotune for this, ya heard me
Freeband gang

Stress all in a nigga shoulders, feel it in my backbone
Trials and tribulations taking the pain with an advil
Rich gang la familia, last night was mad real
Texts in my phone playing jealousy and hatred, misery loves company
But I'm going on vacation, put the herb on rotation, you bite the hand that feed you
You can take a nigga heart but you can't the mind
I got the braincells of a billionaire, I wake up and fly anywhere, fly nigga anywhere
It's Klein-Davis, I'm fucking up club sofas
Spaceships and stars, I see snakes in the yard but I can deal with 'em
These bitches eat pussy better than me, I choke her while I fuck her, can't nobody do it like me
Callin' this hoe my girl had to be on Molly and E
What the fuck I was on man? I'm tripping off that good codeine and kush
Turn my weakness into strength, now forever scripting
Let a hoe ride first class put your shit in the bentley, man what's goin' on?
Put my codeine on swishers
Fuck it I love it, I taste it
When you frustrated cause you been a good nigga, when you was a crook nigga tryna' play it by the book nigga
And got played by a crook, nigga, it ain't easy at it look nigga
But God got his eyes on me
Like Whitney on the track
I will always love you for having me recognize the reality of karma

You runnin' low on drank nigga
Right now you in a movie
Escomoe City

All I want is some money

We gone ball out in trues
We done fucked all the hoes
We done walked in every pair of Louis came in the store
We done got cool with the owner
Out of town we bought out the club
Valet parking the car, man I’m already a star
Already bought out the bar, man I don’t walk to no bar
Man I got a tab with the waitress could have bought a car
I let her ride in the dipper, I bet her flipper I sell it man
I done spent twenty thousand going in at the telly

We done drank all the lean
We done smoked all the green
We done flew to Miami and turnt it up at the king
We done went crazy at mansion when ? played at the mansion
I live a superstar life, yeah the fame ain’t nothing
These bitches ain’t nothing I got these bitches on lines
Bally Gucci and Louis I’m in it all the time
And the Louis store down in Houston they hit my direct line
Ain’t a bitch I can’t buy, ain’t a car I can’t buy

I stay high as a soda
And my jewel worth a quarter
I got plenty of soliders I knock your head off your shoulders
I know the manager homie don’t make me play back on camera
The security can’t handle us cause they know we some animals
? everybody in here my people
See them goonies over there you know them niggas my people
They say its deeper to keep her so thats why I smash em and leave em
She ain’t up on her visa so young future can’t keep her
Cause all I want is some money

My nigga, Zoey my brother
We on Pluto we gon' always stay up here nigga

I bought a stupid AP
The car cost 200 to lease
The car go 200 at least
I'm ready go dumb in the wraith
I'm ready go dumb with the K
These little niggas in the bando
Servin' fish scale at the bando
Came through the block with the roof open
Split a nigga block with the roof open
Slidin' on ya block with the roof open

2 cups in the bitch
Got it out the mud
FreeBandz Gang

Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS wrapped around the Breitling with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening

LeBron on the front, Kobe on the back
I’m the astronaut kid money way taller than Shaq
Before on rap on the track, got her standing on the track
Nigga Cocaine mafia, jumping off packs
Forgiato with the skinny tires, they lookin’ flat
I see you looking real goony eyed
I’m lookin’ back, I be running through the pack to DMV
Used to catch the flight to AZ with fake ID
Represent for the game cause thats how a niggas built
Go and spend a 5th at Fifths, run it up and take a trip
Leaning off four zips, riding in a spaceship

VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head

I got it out the money, that nasty ass money
Brown paper bag ole dope boy money
Foreign with the frog eyes, Bentley with the big head
Fast lane with no hands, counting money with both hands
On the road with checks like a motherfuckin’ mailman
Started from hundred, no-one gave me shit
I jugged off bricks, Got rich off bricks
Forgiatos on that jag I cashed out off a lick
So many bands in my pocket make me walk with a limp
Full of dirty ? Valet at Fifths
Finesse I got Freebandz to get
Black amigo, who live life like this

Forgiatos standing the coupe look bowlegged

Yo Campaign hot it rolling, you ain’t made a real jugg
Ain’t no way that money folded
Got myself hot these hoes in VIP patrollin’
Boogers in my ears around my watch and they loaded
Solitary clips, I’m in the studio devoted
If you knew what it took to get here you could understand my flowin’
Doja, I Hit the dope my words come out folded
Turn the lights our, I’m going inside the mic raw
More Diesel than a 18-Wheeler, I’m with them killers
Forgiato’s on the coupe creeping like a caterpillar
Got the money in the Louis bag, right by to the pistol
Long as the money come, you know I’m gone deliver

True Story
FreeBand gang nigga
Young Will in this bitch

Money coming in from every angle
Paper chasing running to it tryna break my ankle
Evertime I spread tragedy I’m speaking ether
I oan' wanna go to sleep the money got me geeked up

Anytime these bitches see they gone take the E
You a Freehand nigga they can’t wait to greet ya

My words coming out dope this should be illegal
I’m flyer than a eagle
We can never be the same I’m baby Jesus
All my niggas on a plane, you can never reach us

The niggas wanna hate on me that bout to me my employees
I should make you sure but I got a job for ya
Fish scale profit I’mma tell my niggas with it
I tell you when I short it ill be worth a couple tickets
Hundred million now I break my ankle tryna get it
My watch cost a car my car cost a phone digit
I’m too exquisite, Gucci fitted, feel sedition
Mud sippin, water dripping, on a mission, make a real decision
Real persistent, ton of vision, off the game like in the world
Can't compare to this dirty business
All the money in the world

Freehand Scooter, they greet me when they see me
Bossman status, seen some shit you see on TV
Plus I’m bout to cop the Bugatti like Birdman
I’m a young nigga with more like Weezy and Mack Maine
Freehand meetings in Puerto Rico with Hector, me and Isabella
Scooter always flexing

I got niggas down the road, waiting on an appeal
Living life through a pen, I hope they get their appeal
I hope they get their appeal

I just opened up the mailbox, four letters from my niggas
Who fucked up in the system, who got their head up with no a max date
Judge done married them niggas to the state, don’t give a fuck who life they take away
You get your time and they just walk away
Now you riding down that dirt lane
Shackled in chains, bout some petty change
That what folks say
Cuz you thinking bout your kids and they ain’t got a thing

John Gotti did that time a street nigga told on him
That’s why he doing that time a street nigga told on him
Guy Fisher doing his time a street nigga told on him
Big Meechie doing that time a street nigga told on him
In the street s you don’t wanna get caught up with dope boy product
You gon need an appeal, only snitches get deals

Go for it
Tell her somethin' good
That ho, she go for it
See me in the club
Shorty go for it
Got waves in my fade
Need a surfboard
Take fifty to the mall
Let you go for it

Swag jumped overboard
Call the coast guard
Yellow, black Ferrari
Pull up in my Landshark
Have 'em knockin' on your door like your landlord
Money's not a problem, I'm booked up 'till the month of May
Every week, come to the mall, rein'-up Versace
So if you hatin' on Gucci Mane, gon' and get in line
No matter what you drivin', don't park your car next to mine
And if you can't see all these diamonds, then you colorblind
Looked at my watch to check the time, it told me "time to shine"

I tell her somethin' slick, hope that she go for it
She wanna get with Gucci, and we both know it
Smoke so much kush that I need a 'dro card
Sell so much coke that I got a snow award
Hit the car lot like "Fuck that shit, give me two of these"
Then, dropped the top late night to feel the summer breeze
I got her sellin' blow for me, no time
It's like I stuck my dick in a gold mine
Red bottom shoes, and they match the red Chevy
I'm the quarterback, I might just throw a Hail Mary
Gucci Mane, you know I pull a flea flicker
You industry, nigga
I'm in the streets, nigga

My money startin' to stand like an ant pile
I'm all about my grands like a grandchild
Show my ass like I got my pants down
All my fans say that I'm the man, hands down
Diamonds dancin' on my hand, do the James Brown
Smokin' kush straight out the pound, I need to change towns
'Rari crawlin' down the street like a centipede
Ballin' like I'm in the league, but I'm not in the league
Got Jamaicans, and they cut that weed down by the tree
Fuck who it profit if that shit don't profit me
26's got the donk lookin' like it got hydraulics
So, if you ain't talkin' money, nigga, change the topic

**Lyrics from the snippet**

I been winning for 8 years consistently at least respect it
Papoose wrote that ether record, but I broke Aretha record

I can't make this up
Because I can't make this up

When you getting money they say you joined the illuminati
Only time they talkin', when you getting money
When you run the city bad bitches come runnin'
Now they get to be in ya presence, they coming
I can fuck a bad bitch poor bitch real split
I was commin' over old head like slick rick
Nothin rapper, this some OG kurkwood shit
Take a pic Snap a flick kiss my kicks they pay attention
Must they finally realize you in the murkin mix
You gone pull in line or we gone spit that venom
I'm thinkin 10 steps ahead I want my own denim
We were goin in them stackin every penny
Stretching every nickel over the same strippers
I gave it to you straight up, right down the center
We don't like rappin this car is foreign right down the center

I get this big without tryin
I'm matchin' by mistake I want that yacht I'm on my grind
I learn from my mistakes
You want it daddy go and get it
Don't never hesitate
I'm burnin hotter than some lava and I ain't takin off a day
They on my trail, like they tryin' to build a case
These rappers worser than them few
They watch you spendin' cake
They want ya style
And they often imitate
I set the trend
And I watch them duplicate it
I'm satisfied with none of this money I'm getting hungry
I'm breakin' bread with a team young nigga we hit Columbia
Salute the troops we in them coupes like caprices
Old school player ridin' in a foreign feature
Change em up like rentals yeah we change em up like rentals
Ridin' like the president.. I'm presidential
Blowin' green like ya thought I would
It's simple
I'm coming straight up out my temple

We take the cash and ya lost your red and white
The army switched for the rest of their life
Yes I do.. till death do you part
365 yay they go hard
And we go home
Crib so big look like the Georgia dome
I'm rollin like a rollin stone, they do nothin
I pick the streets where I belong
What time were we supposed to be
Maybe its the dro in me
My girl got a girlfriend
Look like she come from overseas
Ain't nothing like these other niggas
I took the chicken out the bill with her
Shit I done still in her its still in em
Who introduced you, to jimmy and tory
Change the color of the bottom of your shoe ya walkin foreign
Gotcha nigga vip
That's very important
I done freestyled
More than you lil niggas recorded

24, 24/7

This right here Christian Dior
You never seen it before
Ever since a nigga tried me in Cali
I took a chopper on tour
You can ask TMZ, MTV, BET
I got more dimes than CP3
Came from the EBT, now these foe envy me
That's off the top just like Kennedy
See this is that pay style
I turn your girl to a Paypal
I'm turning dinner to takeout
I gave her D just like 8 Mile
Whew, Skittles and M&Ms
Murder and killer the synonyms
Even massages ain't feeling them
It's more than a threat than a synonym, ooh
I never fold under pressure
I keep that thing by the dresser
I keep it right by the Bible
I hope it don't mess up my blessings, Lord
You can ask Short I'm finessing
Yeah you can ask God I was reckless
Yeah you can ask Joe bout my neckless
Yeah he put all the ice in that motherfucker
I brought all the dice in that motherfucker
Straight hole like Yanks in this motherfucker
Shit you just cannot ignore
Pinky ring bigger than yours
And my lean pinker than yours
My girl pussy pinker than hers
I bought a Porsche just to trap in
I came on that cat when I'm bored

Poppin' them Percs got me faded
I grab me a bowl and I grab me a fork
And I get in that shit and go crazy
Them diamonds, they on me, they blangin', they blangin'
So I see the truth and go skatin'
Bitch on that savage, I fuck a big check
And I fucked me a nigga old lady
Bitch I'm cold, I need a blanket
Yeah, I'm 'bout my 10
Roll it 'fore it flood, come where I begin
Broad niggas and I cheat on my ex
Pretty titties, I might skeet on her breasts
Skeet on her breasts
80 thousand, put that shit on my neck
80 thousand, spent that shit on a vet
One night stands, just I fuck and forget
Hold up, faded
Ciroc and Patron got me faded
Hold up, wait
These bitches gon' fuck if I blink
I run through that money, you can't
You faded and fuck up the bank
Bitch I'm on drugs, I can't think
You can't hang around if you ain't

Its over 25 girls in my section
Fo real, Fo real
Rockstar life, thats how it goes
Fo real Fo real

We got that drink, hell yeah we got that drink

I bet you wishing they could get fly like us
Ain't go to church this Sunday but I had church
Im on a whole other planet, never on the Earth
I brought my whole hood with me and we goin berserk

A lot of people willin to back that, and if you backtrack
I spoke about this comin to fruition in my raps, nigga
This that I been on a roll shit, Im back on my old shit
416, we know your bitch, that Free Band OVO shit, fo real

I be splurgin, Christian Dior, I got Chanel on order
I met that girl and had to spoil her cause that girls so loyal
We drank champagne just like its water, drink that liquor like water
Im in that mode, Im in that zone like when a nigga raw
Im celebratin every day, goddamn it I could be starvin
Lets have a toast to all my niggas runnin up in apartments

Smokin' on this kush got me paranoid
Drinkin' all this lean, think it come from Mars
I’m Seein' Dead People
All these damn snakes wearing camoflage
Every girl wanna Nicki Menage

I grab the Egg Beater
I seent' them Fed people
I swipe the black Visa
With all this cash on me, walk with the Grim reaper
I go crazy on these features
I just murdered them Jacksons, Grant, and Benji’s
Freebang gang coupled up and ice we winning’
Franklin’ Franklin Franklin’, know exactly what I’m drankin'
100 million dollars, exactly what I’m thankin’
Foreign Coupe shoppin’ and it ain’t got nothin’ to do with stuntin'
I’m Schizo-fuckin’-phrenic in a room full of money
And I’m peeping’ out the window with a hand full of hundreds

Gotta watch out for them people when you chasin' dead people
Them Grants and them Jackson's takin' penitentiary chances
Them Million dollar caps have a nigga living lavish
A freehand bag filled up with faces
All this damn money got me paranoid
Juugin’ all these bricks, I’m doin’ numbers bitch
Young Scooter all about them Dead Presidents
On Monday wrap them bricks up in Camoflauge
You ain't got them dead people you ain’t on your job
Don’t know what a brick weigh get out the streets brah'
Your plug ain’t working you could eat with us

Tortoise shell Tom Ford’s cover my eyesight
Long as I got my sack right I can give a fuck about ice
That Audemar on chill, that Breitling watch on chill
My pocket full of bills and I’m closing out big deals
I’m gonna get me a house in the hills, I’m talking’ bout Beverly Hills
Ya feel, have you ever in your life counted a mill
Ya feel like ya on a pill, and a brand new automobile
With a cup of drank and you drankin’ out the seal
200 on the dash, 200 cash and its real
Thats the only way I live, money cars and cribs
Got cameras everywhere with guns like T.I.P. still

I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
And I ain't even a shooter, nigga
I'm so geeked up, I want to shoot the nigga
I done throwed back a double
In the club, fucking bitches, me and Trouble

White naked ladies
While my pockets on E
It's fuck you, pay me
Somebody save me
Or should I say save this nigga
Cause when my pockets on E
They all looking like victims
Ready to flip your temple
Linked up with tape, put the money in the front
Just pass a blunt and let me go slow
Before I pop three more

My heater to capacity
My pockets full of capacity
I'm feeling like your majesty
I'm Houston classified flying around ya
While them bullets flying around you
I was in Montego, when they found you
Got more ice than a water fountain
And I'm rolling baby, with a Nike sign and two naked ladies
Can't help but floss, nigga, I'm a codeine boss, nigga
I'm throw up fingers, whenever I talk to you
Send her to my section, I'm gonna spread some sauce on you

I'm on all type of drugs, I'm draped up with the thugs
And I don't conversate, cause I converse back with the plug
We handle good business, We smoke good loud
We swap out bad bitches, cause ain't none of them ours

I'm trouble trouble, baby, Geeked up, looking sour
Pass me the Aquafina, Can't do nothing with a single
I done popped so many pills, you can't know how I feel

Ya sold out now fool...)

Gotta see it to believe it

I'm setting goals, I'm reaching achievements
Like fuck a club, fill up arenas
Yesterday, lil mama ain't wonna give me none
She died today, she turned around and wanna give me som
Versace all up in my optics
G all in my code
My plane ticket read out where ever the fuck I wanna go
With a bad Spanish bitch
I did the humpdy donkey
Oh yeah that's me nigga
Cause we supposed to be locked up
For all this shit that we done rocked up
I tell 'em look at here
Bentleys in the front and the rear
Check out a nigga flying

Look, regardless I'm a real money maker
I take my niggas with me they some real participators
So everybody shine Gotta see it to believe it
Now everybody flyin Gotta see it to believe it

Rockstar, you wouldn't even believe it
I'm on the pain and lean and I'm still speeding
My scarf around my neck, Alexander Mcqueenin
Skulls on my back, ya so many skeletons
I'm a Freeband President
I'm outta here, ain't gon never come to Earth again
Everything on me designer, I was born to win
Left the trap in a Phantom
And I ain't coming back

It's plain to see
Been out here on my own so I already know boy
Breaking down my bad habits
Happy that her son done made it
Thankful that I tried
Everything I get, huh? even if it's a little bit'
I make her turn a lot, watch me hit the Shot
He just won the game he's amazin'

Freeband Gang, we good
Yeah… turn up!
Never turn down, aye…

The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

Sippin’ on my sizzurp, shinin’ in my blizing
What up to my lil’ mama, and I salute my main thing
I get paper fast, quick, fast lane, no roof
I’m higher than a space cadet, airplane, no Coupe
And I’m drinkin’ raw, raw lean – good juice
And I rep Lil’ Mexico for real – we gon’ shoot
And I got a stable full of bitches, feed ‘em horse food
And her booty real, real fat – she Toulouse
We inside the VIP on drugs, and good drank
And I’ve got them racks on me now, I’m the bank
She want the red bottoms on her feet, she choosin’
We wanna fuck a Freeband nigga, we ain’t losin’

LA Reid signed Future – he good
Future signed me – I’m good
Now they know my name around the world
In every hood – for rappin’ ‘bout jewels
Got a stomach full of Freebandz – I’m full
I’m good, I’m off the moves I pull
Plus I’m a street pharmacist, supply all the drugs
Meetin’ at the round table, money with plugs
Got a million-dollar company, Freeband major
When you got this much money, man, it come with haters
Every night, me and my bitch, we count up the paper
I’m good, I done beat all my cases

I don’t know where I’m at, I’m in Saint-Tropez
Money take you places, I’m talkin’ far away
I make another movie, I’mma win an Oscar
The way my niggas movin’, won’t need no imposters
We too deep in the game to ever fuck with lames
I’m an astronaut for real, and we are not the same
We ran through plenty bitches, experienced hard times
We grind so fuckin’ hard, and put it all behind
I went to NASA, I’m Super Future now
They shoot a chopper, ‘bout the Future, talkin’ hundred rounds
I’m on my Black Amigo shit, I need a thousand pounds
You wanna triple up your money, send it out of town

You see, I’m not the average nigga, Scream
I’m an extravagant nigga
These my words

Hood rich, bitch
DJ Scream heavy in the streets, nigga
Scream, Scream, Scream

Caught up in these streets, I can’t be safe
I’m paid, put my soul in every line or in the gave grenade
I feel rage, my lil cuz in the cage
The DA say they got a body on him and a witness
I go blank-eyed in the studio and try to fuck up my kidneys, I get ignant
That kush and that drank I had for bean get my spirit uplifted
I take off like a rocket for my niggas who back home sitting in

DJ Scream, heavy in the streets

Hood Rich

I’m paranoid in the streets, because I live it
I’m hungry, and I know it
Cause I done been where you was, that’s why I keep that tool lit
Because if you budge, it’s BOW

Ordinary life of a G
Is ordinary life for me
Middle finger to my enemies
Gotta shake them haters offa your sleeve
By any means you gotta succeed

DJ Scream

I fuck your broad, take your heart, nigga play your cards
I take the odds and I go hard when niggas them trip the charge
I’m on the phone with Wu, while he in the yard
Every time he hit the line, I pick up every time
I might just sit sack, spin a dime, ease my mind
I’m doing fine, I hit the grind and feel it like I’m blind
‘Cause all I’m seeing niggas all the biggies in your city
A product of my city, the binges, the Bentley
The GT, the Contour, no convo, it's pronto
Your head honcho, Congo gorilla niggas
I’m dressed in all black, I had to kill them niggas

It’s DJ Scream

Oh yeah that’s right
Little Rich and the A1 movement is at it again to bring you another street classic

Yeah, yeah, let em know...
Man its the same shit but a different day
Man let me get this off my chest cause I ain't liftin' weights
I'm spittin' cray, but hope my brother find a different way
To chase this money, will we make it? thats a myste-ray
I'm pissed today
Found out some shit that got my temper hot
These niggas fake just keep it real, is you a friend or not?
Pretenders got me fuckin' mad and so I spend a lot
Cause blowin' paper seem to stimulate that tender spot
These men are not no competition dawg I roll alone
And shawty beggin' so I gotta let her tour the home
But if she wanna be my the queen she gotta hold the thrown
And understand that I ain't bussin' off of oral alone, take off that thong

I need that vice versa
Yeah yeah this be that vice versa
Yeah yeah you know that vice versa
Yeah yeah and if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya
This be that vice versa
Uhh, uhh this be that vice versa

See I ain't stoppin' til my life stops
You see these white socks
Probably turnin' negro as I'm runnin' from these white cops
Who want me in that ice box
But fuck them pigs, all they wanna do is beef
Them boys ain't nothin' but some live stock

See that's the shit I'm on
Somethin like my weed, cause every time she let me hit I'm gone
I keep the pen ablaze
Quarters bein' flipped but heads and tails and the endin' phase

Vice versa
Yeah yeah, you know that vice versa
Yeah yeah, this be that vice versa
You know that vice versa
Yea hmm, this be that vice versa
Haaah, yeah this be that vice versa
So if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya

Yeah...it's the Future...the hawk is out..
It's a good look for me man...I'm stronger than ever, I feel great!
Nate Butters, whaddup? It is real, whaddup?
Platinum, got another one, baby! Let's do it!

I'm walkin' this walk, I'm talkin' this talk
The boys they got my back up, walkin' wit' a swagga
Sneaks stay fresh, white-tee stay cris-py
Light crease in my blue jeans, y'all try to stay with me
Nate Butters hook my line up, sharp tape in the sides and the front
Jackie Chan style, I do my own stunts, UH!
Black man, watch that, man right thurr
So much dough in my back pocket, I gotta front
I got favor, my back's watched, how bout your front?
Neighbor relax please, cause trust me this ain't what you want!
Too many soldiers walk with He, be easy
I ain't scared of nuthin' under the heavens
I throw wack suckerz, doggy start hoein' and heavin'
Listen, yo' flow is +daffy+, start +duckin'+
Cause my flow is hungry and my bar'll eat your team up, AH!

SECULAR RAPPERS, I'm COMING, uh!
You hear my footsteps I'm coming..
And I mean this brotha to brotha, man
I hope you suckerz got your bags packed
Cause if not you're gonna feel my wrath!

So relax, boy, before they ask "What Happened To That Boy?"
I make that sin thing diminish and your flesh could go wit' it, UH!
Future's flow quite attractive and dapper
The chiropractic rapper, I GETS IT CRACKIN', UH!
He's so focused, it's nothing that could distract him
Put a low jack on his ankle, y'all still couldn't track him
I'm not braggin', but the flow is proper
Meaning dead somewhere under a field
I give props to Pac and B.I.G., but, that's about it, UH!
And I'm glad Jay finally retired
He got out the game just in time, to miss this fire
But the rest of you suckerz get ready
I'm not heady, I'm just so sure
That Jesus writin' and Future flow sick wit' no cure
Chitty chitty bang bang, Future doing his thang-thang
Rappers' movin' they mouth, but ain't saying a DANG THANG

You secular Iraqi rappers, it's over for you soldiers
Like Bush and Sadaam, I push buttons and BOMB
Flow hits so quick, faster than Islam
And deeper than a Buddhist, I'll show you how to do this!
Matta of fact, I'll show you how to do it the right way
These ain't just bars of stuff I'd like to say
But these is bars of stuff you might see
And don't think it's a game!
I'm twenty-plus years old, I stopped playing around thirteen
Am I the only one that's seeing the world is hurt-IN'
And willin' to spit with substance, not about slingin' and frontin'
Bars is wack and empty, not rappin' about nothin'
Empty barrels making a lot of noise, and listen
I ain't scared of none of your BOYS
I got boys too, and we got favor, what chy'all got is na-thin'!
I'm simply too much for ya!
You can't fool with the brotha, if you do he'll bust ya!
Duck tape your flesh up, doggy, and Bible-butt ya
You better chill before it get real and you get touched brah!

Aiyyo
I swear this shit is unfair
Why niggas wit no talent makin money, while my destiny is unclear?
I ain't the only one who tryna make it somewhere
So ya'll could give it up
But I ain't even close to done here, shit
Yeah I'm livin through these flows that I drop..
Sinnin more than I should, momma knows that I'm not
An angel, far from it, but I goes from the top
Til I can brag about the brands on the clothes that I cop
Won't stop til my wallet it ain't got no room
My shit is all day dawg, I'm not no June
No July, no guns, I ain't go no goons
Stack paper til it spills, I ain't got no brooms
Goddamn it man I gotta blow
Fore I end up in a box from a shot
Realizin that I gotta go
Gotta know, and understand practice makes perfect
So I'm rappin til I'm stackin up a lotta dough
Catapult from this pothole to my paradise
Either I'mma make it, or I'll fall gettin paralyzed
Gotta get it in til the cop sirens flyin out
I'm a lyricist, Ludacris, man we dyin out
Boy im tryin out but the game tough
Lotta playas in my city tryna spit the same stuff
So I change up, like Obama said
Yeah, it's Cole World, but I'm hotter than a sauna bed
Out for that piranha bread
Rip it if I gots to
Livin like a villan but im chillin if I gots you
True... and by you I mean the microphone
Cause you listen well, so the booth is feelin like a throne
Like a stone bein thrown at a metal home
Ain't no breakin me, these boys are deaf I need a megaphone
Hope its known, I'm a faucet on the hottest beats
Future got a flow that send a cold into the hottest streets
So... take a seat if you can't stand the rap
Definition of a rat is someone who can't stand the trap
Yeah. spill rhymes til they sweep up
Get it...keep up....w the...car dash
She want me to hit that bumper like a car crash
Damn...man I said , and ill say it twice
Rhymin ain't hobby anymore this shit a way of life

Go and cop the coupe Just like I want
Get some extra grams off the blow, Just like I want
Told jewelry make my new piece, Just like I want
Shawty put the ? Just like I want
Anytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
If I wanna buy the donk I trick it out Just like I want
I’m a go and buy the coupe just to score extra points

Eveytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
I been hustling from day 1 doing Just like I want
I get my check off the chopper deck
Pull up in a drop with the head off the top of that
Talking to the jewelry store Pocket full of crazy racks
Pop the chop around the corner beam with the crazy zap Just like I want

Going and cop the coupe and trick it Just like I want

Made my partner go to work told him come through with them things
Tryna count that cash by hand ain't gotta bring out a machine
Keep a remix on the yayo ain't a piece of this no clean
I’mma cook up a ring solid stone with the bling
Got a ring get some head get a brand new coupe machine
Wanna lean, I wanna lean lets get a zip and do our thing
Lets do our flip no trampoline you stack as fall as trees
Ain’t no pressure on my cheese I can spend this shit with ease

Going and cop the coupe Just like I want

Stretch them grams out bring the lamb out
Hightop Gucci with the lounge out
Inside and I trick the car out when I come out know the kid out
From the way I buy the bar out plenty money when the boy out
Like when Pk when just said God I couldn’t just buy one car bought the whole lot
Then I burt out from the car lot when I turn out doing donuts
Doing burnouts want a donut hit my burnout
I’m quick to tell them bitches timeout
When them racks out bring that pack out
We gone cashout til that pack out
Hit the mall and by the store, get your hoe and throw down

You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz

Fighting, shooting, killing, riding
Cripping, tripping, spitting fye
In the kitchen, baking pies
Taking mines, making mines
Yellow tape, black gun
Fill it with them hollow shells
And leave the scene bloody
Buddy can't nobody tell
Catch a plane to the ATL
Lay low in a cheap motel
Whatever suits ya
And get a few thangs from my cousin Future
Trapping, rapping in the cut
Talk shit, I fuck you up
So I hit the strip club banging 20 Crip cause

Open up that fye

That’s the way the game goes
Vamp life
No slick
I told Future I can see the future
I told Young Street we gonna get some money
You heard me? Ha ha ha

Chooper on that, chopper on that
My money, my problems, more sin
More bitches with more cash, more bitches with more cash, is all you nigga gonna get
And we gonna love these hoes, gonna love these hoes, gonna love these hoes
We get fly every day, get high every day, it’s the way the game goes
It’s the way the games goes, the way the game goes
It’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes, it’s the way the game goes
Don’t love these hoes, won’t let these hoes, won’t let these hoes these hoes
I’m black in prime, a big 4-5 and a packing luggage
I stack guessed up, my kick dough nigga stay messed up
And the drop head pet with the hop ..
Have to pull em might .. the cashed up
Look too good when we come to the hood
And we stood to the mother*cking ass up
Stupid I rap a town, nigga push up and I back em down
Graduated class, cause a I need a new smash
School to hard knocks no capin’ town
Ride around with scoot up, I’ma top down, let me see the hooters
When get the killers with the shooters, ???
Ride dirty on P stream, come by yourself when you need me
Make one call to my nigga young street
If I have a young killer with the street heat
What a street hang cup, you had a young .. street heat
Even that nigga when you see a black nigga
.. wrong let me get his beat beat

Gotta sell the dope, got a .. can’t trust these nigga, no
You trap with us, I guarantee you see life different too
Them bricks you got it under me, nigga I ..
Don’t hit the store, don’t roll on the flips I really leave em
My Cuban flash with daddy got them ..
That’s why I f*ck with Jimmy, he a real street nigga
I’m up my show money when I buy some pimpin’
True house, full of white like every day is pimpin’
Gotta cup this money, gotta tell this .. gotta rap these chicken
If they ain’t ’bout no money nigga I ain’t with it
I call all these beaks and I know you feel it
Black nigga, Young Scooter we the boss nigga

A killer gonna be a killer
Thats regardless
Of the fact that i'm tin man heartless
No love for ya baby less your walking through my living room braless
With your nipples pokin through your wife beater
You the *?*
She's doing daddy fat sacks soon as I meet her
Get it?
Meat her
Cut to the chase like a cheetah cuz she want that PETA
Gon wife her clown
When so many niggas a wiped her down
You hope that she is gonna turn her life around
About face
A full 180
A ho into a house wife thats yo lady
And me
I never give a nothing but a dope baby
Wit the good times
And the dope dick
She loves the way I talk
And my blow slick
**ain't no way around it**
**yo-yo-yo-your bitch is in love with my dick**
But BIG don't love her at all
Let a monkey nigga pay dem bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA
We the A, A A A

Got too much style on me

Un vaso de lean
Y no estas aqui

Otro vaso y tu todavia no estas aqui

Olvido que no estas preparandome
Una  botella de codeine 
Todo da vueltas me voy en un viaje
Por el lean 
Una botella de sprite 
Una bolsa de holly ransh
Todo el jabe que pude encontar
Para olvidar que aqui no estas

Me estoy asiendo adicto
Pero tu no eres juez para dar un veredicto
Y en la calle sigo bien sigo invicto
De codeine tengo buen suministro
A un que los fedes hagan un registro
Todo es legal pero ya no resisto

Te veo y siento que es en 3D
Siento que te veo y no estas aqui 
Ya me hizo efecto la codeine
Y sigo solo aqui pensando en ti

Otro vaso y no estas aqui x4
Otro vaso y no estas aqui
Le tomo, le tomo, le tomo 
BRRRRR
Le tomo , le tomo , le tomo

CODEINE CRAZY !

Es war 2004 damals hieß es .... - die Ruhe vor dem Sturm ich halte jetzt mein Plädoyer

Viel zu lang hab ich .... hab gesehn das keiner hilft , statt ne - helfende Hand kam - dann noch ein Tritt

Es War alles nur ein Dream , rappte Nächte lang auf Beats, plötzlich kam dieser Nebel ich verlor auch meinen feel - zurück zu dem Anfang
Die Karten werden neu gemischt, ich öffne meine Augen und kann sehen wer meine Freunde sind

Ich bin unterwegs, bin am Nachdenken , meine Beats machen, meine Parts rappen. Scheiß auf früher was zählt ist die Zukunft
Ich mach das für mich und nicht für Klicks dann auf Youtube

Dicka ich war 16 und bekannt in meiner Stadt , da kam es noch kein Bang, P.A. Sports oder .....
Doch jetzt bin ich zurück ich treff den Nerv der Zeit, ich komm allein in deine Gegend und frage wer will Streit? - wer?

Ich bin immer ehrlich und loyal zu meinen Mitmenschen, doch in diesem biz musst du leider nur an dich denken

Es war cool damals mit den Jungs, den ersten Schritt zu machen ist die eigentliche Kunst
Guck mit diesem Song will ich euch jetzt zeigen was ich fühle
Die Hoffnung ist mein Antrieb doch der Hass macht mich müde
Schon von klein auf wollt ich auf die Bühne, ich nahm das Mic und fing an zu üben

Doch was ich in der Gegend seh ist bestimmt nicht mein Lebensweg
Ich suche nach 'ner Antwort doch kann schwer durch diesen Nebel sehn
Viele haben ein Tunnelblick und sehn am Ende nichts, doch vergessen oft am Anfang ist ein Schalter für das Licht

Ich wusste nicht wie's weitergeht - doch ich kämpfe und will wissen wie die Luft ist wenn man oben auf der Leiter steht

Ich geb nicht auf, ich will mir was beweisen
Den erst dann hast du's geschafft wenn andere dich beneiden

Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot
Leavin' Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of magic
The way I make that work -disappear call it magic
The way I make that work- disappear call magic
Sipping on the purple and yellow drinking magic

While I magic, while I magic, while I magic, while I magic

Call up my accountant, he gone make it to magic
KE and Young Future bringin' them the fire
Gotta drop a half a brick you wanna put me on a flyer
'Cuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em forgave me

Two bad bitches wanna fuck me the greatest
Aye Young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'm a do a 180
For the haters I'm a gone 'head & do a 360
Drinkin' on Sprite got lean all day
I'm a Astronaut Nigga better chruch my pimpin'

Learned the Astronaut Kid no such thing as limitation
Flyin' down 20 in the mothafuckin' spaceship
Two bitches trailin' in a platinum Infiniti
Gotta thing for me, don't wanna sing for me, they like my energy, I'm a embassy
I know tricks like Cris Angel
Ion trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from yo past life
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walkin' when you walkin'
I used to be fly but now I'm hawkin'
I was an Earthlin' now I'm SiFi
While I, I stay High)
And pull out in that new Porshe

Blast Off
What are you still doing in my store
Abu I know you got some cases in the back
No more cases, I'm sick of Freebandz
You come in take all the Sprite, mix your Dirty Sprite
I'm sick of it, no more True Story
We out, I'm bout to go to Pluto anyway! True Story
Where Is Pluto?
