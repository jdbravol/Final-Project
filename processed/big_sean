I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Power moves only, nigga

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid, then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far




Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit, like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and everyday I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin', like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me, like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you




Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed

I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
I'm way up, I feel blessed

Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed



When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew, time, kill, months, still

I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "ain't no woman like the one I got"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy



If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back

D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power — how I know?
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

"Hey, I'm outside."
What are you doing here?




They used to tell me, used to tell me

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out"
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you
It's all good, I love you grandma





I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the make up, yeah

So I'mma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk till you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!"
I'm on


So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it till it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't


This to all my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, won't stop right now
Hell nah, won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

Sometimes hate can be the best love

Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag

I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip

Remember when we laid at you and Paige’s crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn’t get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don’t spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn’t afford nothin' but we still get shit
Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can’t let go, I can’t let go
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like “let’s go”

Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful
Yeah I know you’re not supposed to hate cake and eat too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?

It’s been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D
And ain’t came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That’s about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY
I shoulda’ known now how you watch Sex And The City
I know we ain’t close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I’d be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
And when Thanksgiving come around
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it’s back to the drama
“No I don’t know that number”
“Why the hell you text it?”
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in

Ooh, yeah, Gucci python
Ooh, yeah, she play with her tongue
Yeah, I bought that bitch a new charm
Lit nigga pop one
The devil had entered my soul
Remember my grandmama had told me you better be somebody
Watch how I lead the posse, I made an M deposit

Left hand got three rings, that's Bron Bron, we up one
Bad bitch she a savage, take her to the mall and buy her something
That's gonna wanna make your friends come
Make way with the tommy gun
Why can't y'all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Why can't y'all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Ten toes, yeah, you gotta stay down, ayy
Just some young niggas looking for a way out, ayy
People watchin', yeah, I gotta skip town, ayy
Hit my phone if you need a whole pound, ayy

I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free
Fuck it, I sacrificed it
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah

I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take
I'mma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain
I sacrificed for your entertainment boy
I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix
Check the last name it's all facts
And the human race is all about pacing
Look at all the ones I outlasted
I'm the one at the end like I count backwards
Never satisfied, details classified
'Til the afterlife, make a sacrifice, Don
Why can’t y’all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Why can’t y’all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?



I think I’m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window

Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn’t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" The question is, "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
This one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you




Oh! Oh!
You are just what the doctor ordered
Ooh, look at there!
I heard you was a pleaser, and baby - oh shit!

Man, not my mama; man, not my mama
Man, not my mama; quit messin with my mama

Don't call me daddy, only she can do that
Boy you don't know nothin' about that
Ain't my fault, you can't add
Up in the keyhole straight spying
Only knock the door if you're dying
She's so much better than my old bitch
Man, I love that old bitch, I do
Oh! This feels so nice, oh shit!

No stress, no drama
Her kids hatin, they know I fucked their mama

Quit messin with my mama
Quit messin with my mama

Shoulda known she was kinky
Even made me use my pinky, the way she teach me
It's just so dreamy, oh God, damn, man
A nigga be tryna chase her, take her, date rape her
Stand out the daycare sit there and wait there
Fuck, I can't even trust the neighbors, damn
Ooh this great, big, enormous motherfucker!
Oh! Just let me, oh! Let me jockey this dick!

No stress, no drama
Her kids hatin, they know I fucked their mama

Quit messin with my mama
Quit messin with my mama

I got my welfare check, smokin on that crack
Hell yeah I'm unemployed, baby daddy down my back
Now what you got for me Sean? I heard it's big and it's long
I take my teeth out, suck it good, this where your dick belong
Y-Y-Yeeeaah, do it like dat daddy
Pump pump bump bump it in my ass-matic
You ain't tell me you was big-boned
{Mom, I'm hungry} Shut your mouth, you little bastards go on
Sl-Sl-Sl-Sl-Slap me in my face with it, get a crack valve with that bass in it
If I got weed then I'm lacing it, eat all this ass, quit tasting it nigga

Man not my mama, man not my mama
Man not my mama, quit messin with my mama
Man not my mama, man not my mama
Man not my mama; quit messin with my mama

Fuckin' e'rybody mama...
Rollie tell the time, she ain't yours, she ain't mine
Overseas like "bonjour", last ten years I've been on tour
And I still got that old money, I touch more green than a lawnmower
I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up
My pockets stuffed with dough, I made it all in the streets
I might just go to the club, and throw it all on a freak
Yo mama, ratchet ass bitch

Baby, oooooh, can you feel what I feel? OH shit!
I hope you brought your boots and shoes, cuz motherfucker
I'm gonna be here a while



Do or die, nigga
I'mma keep poppin' this Champagne
Don't worry about shit
Finally famous, nigga

Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky
Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man, I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

Man, I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I  just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See, I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game, don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy, the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish Stone Cold it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper, don't even know it
It's written in the stars, man, the sky is the author
I pulled the sword out of the stone, I'm King Arthur
Motherfuck your armor, nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma
You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter
Nigga, that shit just get deep

Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky
Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man, I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep, deep

Been going hard all day
Wish a nigga would fuck with me
Then I blow the candles out on my cake
And niggas always thinking it's a game
Til we ran them out the arcade
Stunting in my southernplayerlistic Cadillac, Andre
I talk that cash money shit
YM plus CMB, you can do the math for me, bitch
Jail time, a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off, get it mailed out, stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well, tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me, but it's cool cause I never give an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos? He ain't throwing up signs
Well, let me throw up mine
And also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time then cross it with pride
That's real, my nigga, remember that
And it ain't about if they remember you, they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
Cause this shit is deep, deep
Deep as empty pockets, nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets, slime
That shit get deep

Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky
Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep, deep
Man, I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep
Yeah, oh my god is just so deep, Yeah, yeah
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep



Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back"
Fuck it

Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like "ahhh"
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how I'm with her I feel whole too
Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he's on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse

Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl



I am ready right now
Uh huh
I look up I don't even know no more
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more, official shit

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, "Stay strong, son
And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea"
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

She been mad, I've been on the go, on the road
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
That quote on quote, say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me
She been mad




I guess I'm on my... on my Don shit
Somebody gotta do it

Look, no more interviews
I'm not talking about this on a song, feature or interlude
Reporting live from Hawaii with my girl
I brought sand to the beach
Working on vacay in the booth, sand on my feet
I'm from the ground up like a ground-ball play
I'm coming from the underground like it's Groundhog's Day
I'm talking so underground that when I talk about J, nigga
I might mean J Dilla, R.I.P. real niggas
Lately I only do the shit that inspire me
Lately niggas treat the Shade Room like a diary
Oh yeah, is that what you heard?
Believing everything that you hear without confirming it first
And you know the funny thing about it is my ex wanna write a tell-all
Fucked up thing about it is she ain’t even tell all
Like how I introduced her to meditation, positive thinking
And the books she probably read in daily rotation
I learned when people lie on you not to return the favor so
I won’t get you embarrassed
I won’t tell them all the other parts about you that's plastic
This my last time putting my ex in a song even though the last one went triple platinum
I’d rather put that energy into what's worth having
Like how I got a platinum album with no solo tour
Niggas say it's over for me, I go overboard
Back against the wall like my poster but I’m the poster boy
Not from the city if you let THEY tell it
Greatest rapper of all time if you let YE tell it
You ask me, I don’t got the resume yet
But, shit, I can go bar for bar for niggas who talking off
And getting egged on by A&Rs who, soon as your shit fallin’ off, they walkin’ off
And if you rappers diss us and ours just know that you dead and you know it
My career been moving perpetual motion

I'm not impressed with the whoopty woop, I don’t know who is who
And can’t pretend like I’m hip to it, no hula hoop
And I can’t lie like I like this shit like I usually do
And I'm just not impressed by you niggas rapping fast
Who sound like one big asthma attack but trash when I’m rapping it back
Who you put in your top five and claim they the savior of rap

So many friends turn to enemies, they frenemies
I don’t know why I act like I’m surprised or it's offending me
I’m saying, though, I should have learned from Hov and Dame
From Stunna and Wayne, Cudi and YE
What happened to our family ways, though?
When I put you on that song with Nas, you had told me that you was forever grateful 
And that we brothers, so it hurt to hit the internet to find out that me and you don’t fuck with each other 
Over a miscommunication that probably could be fixed with a 5 minute conversation, I’m still praying 

For ya, though, I guess I charged it to the game
How much it cost? Around twenty88
Going off like Kobe when he wore the Crazy Eights
All y’all niggas looking like my kiddos wearing Bape
Shot my first video in the Harajuku store
With Nigo in the background, that's a picture that you can’t take
Yeah with Hype Williams directing each take
And GOD directing each step that we take

I’m a king, a legend, man, you niggas ain't worthy 
10 years in and a nigga still under 30
I’m feeling like an old man that failed at life
So I’m treating every second like it's an investment 
Time is money, every second I’m collecting 

Don’t ask me no stupid questions 
"Are you still signed to YE?" questions, no Roc nation questions 
Or who I’m dating questions, look, no more interviews 
Unless you wanna talk about the music or something that has a different view
And not the shit that's getting the hits and views
Words misconstrued with no credit, but you niggas approved

My mistakes are my biggest professors and learning life lessons 
I realize it ain’t what you have, it's what you feel, that's what true success is
I am the one of one, after me there's no successor 





Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better

This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about

Voices in my head saying I could do better
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck


Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracting

Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

Stay focused
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still

Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head



Whoohohohohohohoho
Whoohohohohohohoho
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like

Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the end of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
And now we out of high school, you got a fatter ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I can't even sit here frontin', lie and pretend
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
Told her check the Valley, seems like out there they be hiring
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring
A new scenery might just be inspiring
She said "Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good"

Okay I came up how I came up
A little change but I ain't change up
A little fame but I ain't famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supplier now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Still living how I'm living cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it

Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top
Spending extra time when she ain't got it, on me
Then she turned around said
"I'm so proud, seems like everywhere I'm hearin' ya
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask"
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said "Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet"
Signed me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on and poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody
Oh boy, swerve

Okay I came up how I came up
A little change but I ain't change up
A little fame but I ain't famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supplier now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Still living how I'm living cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it



Yeah, you know a nigga
Don't really wanna take his cool off, uh

Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, yeah

So G.O.O.D. she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on-on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up

Talk to the, talk to the, hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

I be saying, I, uh, I think
When I know, uh, just because..

I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it’s just so amazing
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I’m speed racing
Leavin' with me, it’ll boost your reputation
Westside is where I’m stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

And this was all inspired
By a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Through all the evil in your eyes swear I can still see the good though

Hella drama, TMZ'n,bitch I'm leavin' then she switched the shit like

What you got to hide, hide, hide, hide?
Lying next to me at night, night, night, night
You text me all the time, time, time, time
See, I know what you like, like I did the last time
Do you remember, do you remember?
Do you remember, do you remember?
When you had nothing to hide, hide, hide, hide

These hoes be doing research
I swear she like this piece of hair off in the sink
Ain't come from me first, no, no
You hang around too God damn long it's like you need work
Man, these hoes be doing research, doin' research

Okay I know you did some research, well shit I did too
I saw you wearin' Drake's chain, like you were part of his crew
I saw you chillin' with Meek Mill, up at the summer jam oooh
I hope my eyes the one, that’s lying to me girl and not you
I know we all got a past, but there's shit that I can't pass
Seein' you at the soho house, I know you can't afford that tab
When I run into Chris Brown and he laugh, cause he know what you know
When I don't it make me feel, like I don't know your ass
Now you saying shit like

Lying next to me at night, night, night, night
You text me all the time, time, time, time

You hang around too God damn long it's like you need work
Man, these hoes be doing research, doin' research



Uh, yeah, look

Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some xxx girls
Pussy get wet as an s-curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back" Fuck it

Oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank god I'm with my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world

You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

Yeah, oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank god I'm with my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank god I'm with my girl

Pink caddy, Pepto-Bismobile
Ting named Cali, that ass on sunset hill
A beautiful view, unusual, I'm hooked on the real
And you would be too, I'm pookie bout that coochie, for real
Okay cool, I guess I love the way you
Nourish the soul, you know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit
Hitting them push-ups so when I'm up in that what's up, what's up you get whooped up
Arch that thing like where I'm from, been on my brain, miss serotonin
Living la vida with my Lavita, feel like Ceddy
Liberate your limbs eliminate your limits, let me
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty
She said "Smino boy I get it all ready"

Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl



All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

Feel like you owe me checks
Owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply
I got no regrets, you disrespect, disrespect
Only time I seen you now is on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to
You got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals
Now you back,  it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do
They didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
'Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya
Damn

All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play no blame game
Pointing fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust
I don't wanna have a fake us

But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

Nigga, you know what's about to go down when you walk out that door

Does mom know about this one?We know you're close with your mom
What you say about animal cruelty?

You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

Sean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on
You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV,  touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, whoa
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through
So when it's time to travel management say I only need two
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze
Lately though my family been too happy
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice
We supposed to be the role models
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college

Is this the example I'm tryna set?
Are these the people I'mma forget?
Are these the times I'mma regret?
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but

You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

Okay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some
Life could be a test, multiple choice, choose some
Choose one, stick with it, man, prove some
Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'
Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad
One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad
And it's only one me, divide it and do the math
I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class
How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?
I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots
Man thats drama, drama drama
So deep that call each others mamas' mamas
We need a break I mean comma, comma comma
I'm tryin, homie
But she always picks the wrong time like phones dyin' on me
In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me
It sucks to hit the internet and see you're lyin' on me

Fuck
Is this the example I'm tryna set?
Are these the people I'mma forget?
Are these the times I'mma regret?
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but

You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

See, the mind is a fucking trickster
It can fuck you 'round, but your heart will never lie to you
And that’s why people love you, Sean
Because you talk to them from the heart
That’s why you're magical, Sean
It’s no mistake that you’re where you are right now
You speaking that from your brain, but they hear you from your heart
Because people can see your bullshit
And I know I’m talking a lot of shit
But I want you to hear that
Because I’m a great motherfucker, man
And I’m very modest
You know, I am
And I know a lot of shit
They know when you bullshit
They don’t even intellectualize it
They feel it
Life is a feeling process



Yeah
This is that-
Uh huh, where the money?
Uh huh, what, what

My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night

Been waitin' on that shit my whole life

And they always stay down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor

Okay, I ain't that fucked up, but I'm halfway
We came a long way from the alley
Bad, bad, bad bitches they dressed up
Like it's the NBA draft day
And I bet and I bet that she ain't gon' be that late
For a young, sexy face like me
A young, young, young, sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya
The way that you pose I might have to IG ya
Sexy young thing, I might have to ID her
Ooh, damn I got some ideas
We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea
Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur
Older women be like, "damn, you mature"
I say you the one, but goddamn I got nerve


Okay, I sip the kamikaze while I bend the body
And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby
I be mobbin', I be mobbin' like I'm Gotti
I might even speak Italian
50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby
I be wildin' like I never had a daddy
And the titties paparazzi, they be flashin', god damnit I'm a hottie
Got her friends tryna fuck me and her man's tryna rob me
And she won't leave me alone, I tell the trick to get a hobby
I ain't even gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick
With a billion dollar pussy
Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist
They gonna give you courtside at the Clips
But never ownership, they ain’t on that donor shit
Well, fuck giving it to me, I'mma take that shit
Forget crackin' the code, I'mma break that shit
I'mma calamari steak that shit
And cop so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit
Hoes tryna have my baby just to Ricki Lake that shit
I hate that shit
Girls handing me their heart, how could I not break that shit?





Nothing is stopping you
Stopping you
Stopping you

I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone 'til we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like "Fuck, let's do it"
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, "Let's do it"

When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music

Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
But under these conditions, she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it
Getting rest that I be missing
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, but time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say "Aye dawg, What you got?", "Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
So I give him my email on a fly
And if his song's good I'll reply


Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry





Tell 'em that I need more

I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Dealt with real life shit, manned up and got through it
I'm a real D-Boy, take a look up in my face
Never did real estate, and still put you in your place
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
Every time I spit a verse, my city like "Preach!"
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets
B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast
Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speak in Trapanese
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back
Back on my feet, that's just how I be
I be out of town repping valid as an absentee
Lord G's, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me
Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth
Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch
I'm even working half days on my day off bitch
Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts
'Long as that weed and money chilling in the pile
Bitch, I need that fucking fire

Tell 'em that I need more

Right now, right now, right now
I know it's been a long, long
It's been a long, long time
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time

I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Can do anything in the world except not do it
Bought my fam new land, six star crib
Momma feeling like she Jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Coming from Detroit where everybody say "what up doe?"
Horror movie shit, cause everybody there cut throat
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
And grandma sad when she saw my commercial
"Stop having people at your shows that wasn't at rehearsals"
I’m tryna to get a office at the Empire State
To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home
Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state
Prayin' that I won't be late
When it's all finished at the endin', after all bottles spillin'
Throttle gripping, models switching, chin chilling in my villa
Fucking like I tryna populate a village, I'm replenished
I didn't do it just for the money, man, for the feeling
I made it through the...

Tell 'em that I need more

Right now, right now, right now
I know it's been a long, long
It's been a long, long time
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time

But it's never, never been too late
It's never, never been too late
It's never, never been too late
It's never ever been too late
Right now, right now
I know it's been a long
I know it's been a long, long time
Just know that it's never, never been to late
It's never, never been too late
It's never ever been too late
It's never ever been too late
Do what you wanna do
Fuck everything else



Do or die
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and I still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya




Imma' be paid forever
I look up
Finally Famous Nigga

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

All this bread can’t be too good for my cholesterol
Don’t come round’ talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire, dawg
I can’t lie bruh lately I’ve been stressing heavily
Im sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
You bitch you, FF Imperial til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material til I’m dead, I’m living proof
If you focus on what’s in front of ya and not what’s in the peripheral
It’s gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I’m bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMS’ing, no Hablo ingles’
If police ask questions, we don’t know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it’s been depressed so long I can’t even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon’ pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil cuz thought the fair was here
Like oh, Im primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who? My team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for?

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline




Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?
I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official

I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face
If I ain't going to get it that day is going to waste
I'm tryna move in my safe like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like "This the girl Imma take out"
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way-way out
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all god damn year, oh yeah
I can tell that it's near but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit yeah I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know 'bout living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yes, and I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like "Sign these"
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gon' stop
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said, "I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gon' stop"
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors
I started from the basement made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on
Said, "I don't owe nobody in the world no favors"
I started from the basement made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on

Bitch, watch how you speak to me
I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs
Tryna get paid repeatedly
Jamaica or Cancun, now that's where I need to be
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
I've been thinking about becoming a cop
So I can murk some niggas one by one off legally
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like "man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother"
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then get back to making like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, call me the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour
Like thank you God, look at all we created
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement
And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers



G.O.O.D.!
After God, after my family, I ain't gon' front
Ain't nothing more important than this success
Than getting it, yeah
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

Tell the police I'mma stack this paper 'til I overdose
Whodie holdie slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over close
I overflow all over hoes, my niggas is over hype
Shooting up your Phantom
Now they call your shit the Holy Ghost
Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy
And protect me from the hoes
That when life ain’t sweet, they gon' desert me
Shut the fuck up and stand up when you see me
Like I'm the verdict
That's respect, now I got your wifey
And you back to using that Jergens
Hurting, sipping, spilling
Tipping, for my niggas who done passed way
Charge your ass a "fuck you" fee
And make you pay your tax today
I'm on a secluded island, swear it feel like Cast Away
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away
I feel like getting paper is my destiny
'Til I rest in peace, get money recipe
Told my mom "Get what you want
Then just leave the rest to me"
Ain't no motherfucking rest for me

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Diamond rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler
I got cars, cribs all in my neck
Got them M's all in that bank
Griff, Blake all in that paint
Stacking bread, come watch me plank
Pray to never dying broke
Getting cases by the boat, we ain't shopping, buy the store
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break
Mula ain't everything homie, it's the only thing
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the hall of fame
Talk money, we got it, fuck boy, shoot your stylist
Eating good, I ain't brolic, I'm just chasing them commas
My niggas ride that five, and my bitch a ten
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks, fine freaks, fine freaks?



Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I look up, I say I think it's time to kill it

Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me
I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly
I tell her make me a sandwich, no PP & Jelly
She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?"
I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah ho"
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do
Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gangbang major pain
D-Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day base, then vacay for eight days
You know muthafuck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, Oh no, you can't taste it

Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switch up naw naw I ain't switched up
Same me naw naw I ain't
Switch up
Same team naw naw I ain't switched up
I think it's time to kill it

I said I think its time to kill it

Bought a Cadillac, now I’m Cadillac Com
She ride alright, when I'm riding right, Put Cadillac on that lawn
Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean
Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down
I’m in my mode today, sayin what the fuck I’m ‘posed to say
Moving making money, got them trashbags back
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweet and I'll eat her
Got strippers and divas, plus some cougars and cheetahs
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Bonita
I said ease up, ease up, ease up
Ain’t nobody fucking with my clique


All I care bouts my crew, my family and women
Except these women that’s hoing, and these hoes that be stealing
Trying to get them a cut, that’s how you end up with stitches
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position
Either move or get devoured, fuck a coward
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I dont
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,
Smile for the polaroid, self-employed
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy
And I'm with the same crew til I'm an old man
Cause there no such thing as new old friends



Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
I'm with the same OGs
The same old team,and you know my team
Ain't switched



Uh-huh, is it time?

Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

Don't let them take away your soul
Don't let them take away what makes you whole




Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass

Fuck yo time, nigga

I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour, I really can’t lie
I was the man when I started, I'll be the man when I die
Man these hoes, take your money and I take they virginity
I’m high, I split an O in half, now it’s a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in the air and pass it, yep, that's alley-oopin
Okay now, oh that's yo girl? Well I don’t give a mass of two shits
Okay I’m west side, west side 'til I’m died and underneath them tulips
You bordo like Enrique, I’m too paid, I’m three-paid
I’m looking like I’mma sweep stakes but I treat ya girl like a cheap skate
Cause I need a crib, a big estate, I need a boat and that need a lake
I need some salmon, that need a plate that need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who I’d be widdidy-wid-it, Rose I sippity-sip-it
I’m Quagmire I fuck hoes, my cashflow I "giggity-get" it
Boy, I’m cock-a-mamian, the most zaniest, insaniant
I love girls that Arabian, Albanian, Caucasian
I ride around gettin cranium cause my dick is hard as titanium
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it, bitch

I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I’mma let you live, the world mine
This world mine

The one and only in this mothafucka
Niggas staring like we the only ones in this mothafucka
How could you not know we in this mothafucka
I got my haters looking lonely in this mothafucka
Whoa, I’m sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up nah, I ain't gambit
Shit, I’m wasted-wasted, this looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah-nah, good lordy, whoadie, I just took more shots than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin, the baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing!
Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she towing
I hustle hard like I’m finna lose the crib
And party hard like I’m finna do it big
All I ever do is big, so all she wanna do is Big
Girl, what your name is, I really can’t remember
And Tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I’m up up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I’m Zeus
Bitch stand back watch how a real nigga do it

I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I’mma let you live, the world mine
This world mine



My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don’t earn, best believe I’m gon’ learn
If I can’t do either or, shit it’s none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I f-fill every urn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too
Niggas seven feet, telling me I’m who they look up to
Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up
Don’t invite ‘em to my shows but always still manage to show up
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be voting
So when you step inside my office, treat that bitch like it’s the Oval
El presidente, lord, sensei
Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting riskay
Crazy nigga, they ain’t seen it like this since ‘Ye, yea
Well this the life that I live
Collecting everything overdue, for all the work that I overdid
D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I’m Oprah kid
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist
‘Cause when you come from the bottom man it’s so hard to just get a glimpse
So hard to get a glimpse, so while I’m here I might take a pic
And show ‘em that it’s more to the world than tryna make a living
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it
Okay, como me llamo
She say Ingles, no hablo, man, unless it’s eat me out though
Benihana, my McDonald, all black leather jackets
While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I’m Keanu
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do’
‘Cause I got too many real mufuckas I ride for, die for, uh
Straight out the metropolitan
My city need a hero so I treat it like Metropolis
And it’s a few bad Lois Lanes I can’t name
Even though I’m me, Lord knows that I can’t save
But I’m still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain’t rich
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man we ain’t make shit
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate
Man we was trying to get away, man we was trying to get ordained
‘Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I’m fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suing me and they just banking on the settlement
Never settling, life is too fast just to settle in
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement like damn!




I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was "bye" more, "fuck you"
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine


So don't tell me you love me
Whatever you do whatever you do



Yeah, G.O.O.D

Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping "Ready or Not"
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

Seems life's never at a stand still, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't schools teach more mathematics?
Less trigonometry and more about taxes?
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life instead of lab rat us?
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we could catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speedboat my dad always wanted
Mm, I swear I feel it coming

Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world




Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school, man, right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She asked why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look at what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

What's the noise all about with this rap stuff?
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game
I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm copping stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on
Not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance - I'm signing off with a crotch grab

Thank you man. for letting me get on this record Sean
You the coolest
GOOD music nigga forever
Understand? Yahm




I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne, all the people I plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're on high hills
Tits sittin' high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man

Everything high
It's time to go

I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

Cause the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big and I never plan to downsize
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights with a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna say hi right

Everything high
It's time to go

If you roll one up, I'mma roll one too
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke? Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club, I be up in the clouds
Ooh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the O, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows hidin' it when I travel
In case the police gotta know, rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest, I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna get at this cabbage
My pinky ring a V8, I filled it with carrots
I'm popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high

Everything high
It's time to go

I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

I'm fly, my swell on Priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just write rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a peter pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud, yea it's worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it comes to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fakin', licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L
I need a high class chick that I match up with well
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in Chanel
And you know errthang' high when you livin' swell

Everything high
It's time to go



As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die

Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
"Sean you looking tired", damn homie that’s all?
I’ve been stressin’ so hard I’m surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya’ll, hatin’
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin’ bout computer love
Owe the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag
Make it where I’m from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too, uhh

As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die

If I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this muthafucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
Just don’t wake me up
Don't wake me up
You can’t catch me dreaming
Bout all of this muthafucking money
Cocaine rush, I’m speeding
Cocaine rush

I’m just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I’m accepting the fact that there’ll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I’m just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes’ll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks' y'all can imagine is chatty yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I’m Cali swagging
Huh, my nigga listen, I’m over the fame
You number 1, I’m number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin’ with lames, we ain't rolling the same
I’m the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a check out of this muthafucka
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect
Sean I love you my nigga, I’m out

As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die

I gotta break your fucking heart
I gotta do something that’s innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia’s momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a, I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote
I promise, I know the history of those who died
For the rights for me to survive but those who lied
To the minority will make em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near

As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die



I look up
Straight up
I gave 'em time, time
Time

Now it's back to me nigga
I took my clique turned it to faculty nigga
Took my operation to factory nigga
When I'm in the zone they won't tackle me nigga
I touched down in the city, a fuckin' walkin' target
Still man all my bitches miss me, yeah they miss me but not misses
If you ask me what my interest, all my interest involve interest
I guess you tend to over do it when you come up underprivileged, look
I came to my senses, I can never count on people
I can't even trust the senses in this world full of venom
All I need's my spider senses, my short temper to cool out
Yeah sometimes I need woosah, time to get paid by the goo-ghaas
My office on top of that rooftop, for my mama Myra Anderson
Tell me who gon' be set for life, Myra and her son, fo' sure
One time for the fam, they don't eat, I don't eat
I can't rest on my feet till they all on they feet
They say rest your eyes, I'm just like why?
Bitch I ain't never seen Ben Frank asleep
But I do need that paper like sheet after sheet
I got so much drive ho, look both ways in the streets
When I heard 'bout all these singers and all they naked pictures I'm like "Did my email just leak?"

Hol' up
Lemme check, oh nah nah nah
They fake, we good, we good

The stock goin' up, makin' all the right moves
You would have thought these niggas fell off a skateboard
I got a rich girl, I swear to god dawg, man she's like a walkin' ATM
Except she ain't come in with drawls
I know you've been having G.O.O.D. Music withdrawls
I can not deal with the fuckery that fake shit you be in
All that bullshit that you rappin' honestly just makes me cringe
Money doesn't grow on trees, okay someone explain to me
Then how the hell does my whole team just keep on rakin' it all in, hah?
We stressed on, we pressed on
Met with Hov and Bey they told us we next on
We dream that, been slept on, we kept on, we left home
Mama earlobes is VS stone
Her earrings so big she can't even fuckin' hear nothing nigga
Don't give a fuck, no I can't spare one nigga
No I do not have five wheels, I can't spare one nigga
Talkin' like I'm on the last cigarette because I had to take it back to square one nigga
Sometimes to win the war man you got to lose a battle
But if I lose a girl just know my next one gonna be badder
When I pulled up to the church, ooo, they thought it was the pastor
Heaven sent, raisin' hell, same time, what that's the rapture?
Didn't go to class for a second I swear I woulda failed everything
My passport was the only thing I'm passin', flyin' overseas turnin' dreams into habits
Turnin' coach to first classes, mom I'm never movin' back
And I put six years in the flow, okay, no wonder it got mastered
The flow need a dam, why it's doin' too much damage
God damn it's good to get it, even better with ya niggas
Call up my dog who been in and out depression
Said boy how you living, don't lie to me 'bout your feelings
On the outside you look fine but on the inside could be killin'
You act like a comedian but now you're Robin Williams
And now we cryin' rivers that nobody wants to swim in
When one phone call coulda been the one to prevent it
So I'm there for my dogs till we forever on
Till we hit the dealership and cop the Megazord
Nigga that's the red range, white range, black range, green range, pink range
I learned that every bad bitch comes with mood swings
Just like Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang, so true man
G-5 down to Mexico, G.O.O.D. Music familiar man
We back at it to let you know, I figure it's best you know
In the middle of recordin' we got caught up in the news
About what happened in St. Louis
We midwest kids that shit coulda happened to us
I looked up the flight tonight
Then I realized man I got a grandma now that's half alive
And honestly what happened in St. Louis probably happened in Detroit like twenty times
I hope we finally see the signs
Puttin' gas off in my Benzo, I ran into a youngin'
The same age as me except he in the trash huntin'
Asked me for some change I gave him like one somethin'
Man to keep that shit a hunnid I wish I woulda gave a hunnid
Cause if you ask me how I'm doin', shit you could do the math
I just bought a five bedroom, four bath
Three story, two car garage, I'm one man
I just did it for my mom, finna do it for my dad
And I ain't even sell my soul, imagine what I coulda got for that
I made something out of nothing, it's like I pulled it out a hat
Man when I'm done they gonna statue me, I turned my clique faculty
Operations to factory, in my zone they won't tackle me
Touched down in the city, the fuckin' walkin' target
Still all my bitches miss me,  yeah they miss me but not misses
If you ask me what's my interest, all my interest involve interest
Nigga
Straight up



Yeah yeah

Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this crossed
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like "we don't got time for bullshit, dawg"
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the "um, you owe me" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
"Oh, you owe me likes"
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?
But what about now? 313
515-8772, bitch, call me




Hands up in the air

And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All, all up in my face, like, "You remember who I am?"
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eatin' all the Wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rockin' Sean john
Man, I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doin' better than what everyone projected
I knew that I'd be here, so if you asked me how I feel

A-a-a-all, a-a-a-all
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all

D-Town! G.O.O.D.!



Thanking God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

This the feeling know that I've been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday
With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb
Mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan
Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah
Lately I've been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it is you always act like you knew
You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we always used to dress up as a family
And go to Sunday service, and being in church singin'
Ain't been to church in awhile
But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building
It's about how you praisin' him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone
Or any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet
Who was jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise with me being away
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of you until I see you myself

Praise, so many times I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise, for all the times that you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried and all the days I coulda died
Because of you I survived, because of you I'm still alive

Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah




Like, whoa, whoa
Sean Don, whoa
D-Boys

Look, all I gotta say is what a year, what a year
I decided now that every year is our year
Aw yeah man, that's 'til we disappear
I'm focused on the near and never what's in the rear
Recently I swear man we've had so many accolades
I realized I ain't sat down, not even on a Saturday
Yeah I'm going overtime, O.T like it's TNT
In South America rocking Rio with RiRi
You know that's, stadium status
When you started underground, you gotta make it to the attics
So I'm up in addict Focus, money is the only time I ADD
Boy this shit ABC's, shout out Detail, 7-11 we on the road
I'm on the sixth record off the album going gold
Last one woke they ass up like the morning show
I'm tryna make next year the greatest story ever told
Like, shit, goddamn, standing next to Jay and K, like man
Never took an L and I'm out there from where it's hard to make it this far when you this tan
I'm sayin' I'm Lil B with the right wrist
I realized time make money, it's priceless
So don't gas me up bitch, I'm a hybrid
I know you like it, I see the job's done before I see my eyelids
It's getting better every single day, that's what they told me
And I already wasn't fuckin' with the old me

It's like I hit the light switch
Woah, yeah
It's like I took my family into a new crib
Then I hit the light switch
Hop out and roll on 'em
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life
Hop out and roll on 'em

Look, what's life without risk?
If you take none, that's probably what you gonna get
This year I'm done with crazy hoes
If it's one thing I hate it's lazy hoes
Goddamn, if it's two things I hate, it's greedy hoes
One time for my girls that turn theyself into CEOs
Just know that you the finest
I like older girls that realize they got time left
I like young girls, but not girls young-minded
Ones that shine with you but they won't get blinded
We just went around the world in twenty-eight days
Shows selling more tickets than the matinees
Sold out everywhere, bad bitch cheer
All I gotta say is "What a year, what a year"
Up late, two, three, tryna get the mic skills
Riding 'round ATL, shout out my bro Mike-Will
Making sure the fam straight like they like they up in Mike will
Every Mike, Jordan, Tyson, Jackson
Need the, uh, Washingtons, Franklins, Jacksons
Got the crowd packed in, front in, back in
Like oh, please stop comparing me
You starting up a new whip? I'm starting up a charity
While you got new chains, my family out of debt nigga
Yeah, respect last longer than a check nigga
RIP for my ones who couldn't see the day
I really wish they would have saw me get a VMA
I know my grandma ain't here but it's cool cause as long as I'm around she gon' be here in my DNA
I went from broke to breaking records in the city where I live
While I was breaking that down, they broke into the crib
But they can't break the dream shout to the ones I dreamed with
I ain't rich 'til the whole team rich
It's like...

I hit the light switch
Woah, yeah
It's like I took my family into a new crib
Then I hit the light switch
Hop out and roll on 'em
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life
Hop out and roll on 'em

I got your bills
Pull out the 'Ville
You got the healing
You know you bad ass
I got the light switch
Baby you know, I got the light switch
Woah



Yup, yup
I look up
Cause I can't look down on you bitch niggas no mo, man
If that casket ain't 24 karat gold when I die
Then I ain't made enough fucking money man and that's real talk

This my roll weed time
Don't turn it into dead in the street time
Her legs do the peace sign
Know the hood so well don't need street signs
Young rich and iconic
Big titties I'm signin'
Burnin' benjies and chronic
Big white smoke clouds every time I talk, does it look like I'm in a comic?
Everything I rock I designed it, realer nigga, won't find it
Okay, I be stackin' that cheddar, bet that shit won't expire
Got me ballin' so hard, I need me Jerry Maguire
I made a mil before twenty-five, man and I ain't even no lie
Bitch I ain't sayin' that shit to brag neither, I'm sayin' that to inspire
I'm like, damn boy, fuck you sayin' boy?
Hatin' on me, knowin' that you is a fan boy
When I'm around you call me Cuz like we fam boy?
Rappin' like me let's me know that I'm the man boy
Okay, Hennessy and Bombay is a real nigga entree
I gave her my grande, my food is picante
My girls is Beyonce, your boyfriend beyond gay
I seen him hang with Deandre and they was lookin' like prom dates
One time for my hood 'til I go in the ground
I'm throwin' it up cause they holdin' me down
I'm perverted as fuck, got a pole in the house
Got your girl and your girl and they hoein' it out
But you standin' outside cause no hoes is allowed
If you work like I work, you would throw in the towel
Once you get in this life, man, there's no comin' out
And haters look at me like snow in the south
Surprise nigga
Man fuck it, I'm on, you off and I hope you die nigga
Why you alive nigga?
I'm stackin' dough cause my momma addicted to spas
Yeah I'm the one that these hatin' niggas despise
You better take off your fuckin' disguise, nigga
Bitch-made is in your eyes nigga
Lies nigga
Shut the fuck up, everything'll be fine
Cause this my roll weed time




From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size
From where the judge is the only thing that's courtside
Chasing money in the city of crime
Cash back so then it's black bags under my eyes
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on
Mama had 2 jobs I know that she was working for me
Ten years later, Hired to working for me
Hired the whole family like mobsters
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' yup!
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me
And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!

And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go

Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher
I keep it funky with my misses, fuck these other bitches
And this ain’t biblical but this sermon is spiritual
‘Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few
The upper percentile
Whipping whatever I, 460LS you
I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle
Know that it’s God working
Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles
Yeah, Maybach poetic genius
You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a seven Beemer
I’m trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it
A fly nigga, I keep having a gravity grievance
And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features
That’s like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus
Riding around without a fuck given
Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten
The best in my position, I’m passionate with lyrics
And they ain’t fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen
I’m handsome to these women, I’m envied by these no ones
That’s no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us
And even if you don’t drink everybody po’ up
‘Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon’ show up
Never hate on no one, your blessing’s getting closer
Even when I’m open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup



Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go go go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know -ow -ow

Well, I’m flyin' over, literally, flyin' over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa guy, I stay high like Pluto

I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue
I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee




Finally Famous in this..

It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back
When
I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had
It all figured out


It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times that I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lying and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all triggered out
Even when it.. all of it... when you still ain't got....

Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it




You know what you do
You know what you do
You know what you see
You know what you do
You know what you - you don't know what you do!

How about we pretend all these niggas not around
And get fucked up like we was out of town
Woah, then get fucked up and go get out of town
Swerve, swerve
And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me
How fucked up you down to get?
A pound? A zip? A thousand sips
Red cup yeah that college shit
Free liquor got it on scholarship
Bitch act like you don't know what's up
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up
Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up
One time for the set, please go throw it up
It's Finally Famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced
But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight
Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing
Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella
All she tell me is-

You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
You don't know what you-

I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up
Heart breaker, young heart breaker
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it
I must be doing something right if every mill comes with a spare I guess
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, ohh
Do it for the city, that's the 313
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary
Ass and face is hereditary, her momma, shit, legendary
You don't know what you do


Go, go, go, go. go
Can't let that high go to waste I feel high on
Supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed
Man, watch your back I swear man some of these niggas be
Hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes
But I'mma live this like I swear that's all I know
Know, know, know, know, know, know



Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life’d it!
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch? I’m moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’mma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

Are you willing to give up what you love for who you love
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great?
How many missed calls before you considered fake?
How many dreams before its considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes, you don’t know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say “in memory”
I’m praying that he make it, wished we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories…

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I’m stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can’t purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I’m focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I’m marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I’m huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner’s circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan’
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal $20 bill right out her purses
No I ain’t perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories..

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo



Whoa
Oh God
How I look, Tell me how I look
Exactly

Mona Lisa, Lisa Moanin'
Got some drinks and some motherfucking reefer blowing
I tell her fuck with me and you could be something
Yo girl so bad I want the threesome
Threesome, trying to have a threesome
Look at my watch 'bout three somethin'
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Fuck with me and you could be something

I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers
And if you bring you friend then we got to fuck her
That's what I'm down for no convo, my condo
And if I answer this phone call don't make a sound ho
My life is my odyssey my dogs to the right of me
I got the girl you can't lay a finger on right here massaging me
Like Yeah....I'm the nigga I know it, I'm the nigga I know it
My Momma say I'm a poet, you hating praying I blow it
But this the life I made though
I show a bad bitch what she made for


Freaky

I'm eating lobster with my shrimp hand
Feeling on her with my pimp hand
I'm talking to her like her Daddy do
And bet she give me everything but attitude
Mathematical, radical
Twist my fingers up and rep my avenue
Penthouse altitude, being broke is not compatible
Get a fine girl, Patron that
Get a finer one, and then clone that
You cuff your wife like I want that
When I got freaky women tongue kissing
Marijuana lung lifting
Give long dick then I'm long distance
You in the club bromancing
I got her homancing
Face in my lap nose dancing
No pants screaming


I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers
And if you bring you friend then we

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

You tried to keep me away from temptation
Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him
Mama you know you inspire me
You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy
But I buy that new crib, you look right in it
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in
And play my song every single time you drive in it

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

I know it's hard to get me on the line
I'm busy like every other time
Since I got a house in that other town
You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, "Don't worry 'bout it"
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me


Look, mama, you know you inspire me
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama you know your son shine for ya
I'm Sean for ya, my lady
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy
Anything for the fam, how you raise me
I'm yo baby but you still my baby










Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright

Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright

Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be

"Might not make it this time"
Is what not to say at this time
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
And you tell them they alright, knowing they need a cure
How I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
Around the same time my mom said "Sean, you need a plan
Miss Freeman's son, across the street got shot, now she need a hand!"
Traumatized, God oh why's his momma cry
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, gotta tell this momma lies
Like, "It's gonna be alright," knowing it ain't alright
And I know it's so much pain, and there's probably more on the way


You know I love you momma like she mine
Whether we together, or we trying
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
"This can't be my mom!"
Got me thinking, "whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again"
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out
POOF! Disappear, God make an out!


Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be



I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rocks, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
G.O.O.D music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than Day-Day, no off day just pay day
Boy, since I was a baby I swear I was OG, you was a no G
Textin' these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not gettin' that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped "Control" just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearin' the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talkin' with the same hoes
All day about how Em ain't the same Em
And Hov ain't the same Hov
Some niggas never grew up, boy, they only grow old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
Fuck with me and you Detroit food
End up on the fuckin' Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
Fuck am I sayin', man, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright though, if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10
Sean Don...

I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

They done fucked up now, ha-ha
Mastermind...

My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bilingual
Some call it trickin' cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherfuckin' die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Comin' through and I don't fuck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said "fuck a nigga"
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought
16's of coke, all my verses be dope
Fuck XXL cause I'm the source to these quotes

I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

I done work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem
Nigga please!
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, oh god, how you do that?

I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline



After God, after my family, I ain't gon' front
Ain't nothing more important than this success, than getting it

Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
I'm with my shooter and a preacher hallelujah
When they view ya fucking around
Me and my niggas we come in your town
Busting them bottles and fucking your bitches
And when they start hating we gunning them down
Don't fuck 'em around, boy I get money all day
And I ball hard like Tim Hardaway

Let her ride this dick cause I had a hard day
And my dick even harder, you whippin' the charger
You put your rims on and you think that you're balling
I'm whippin' a Bentley, I can't even call it
And my shit so retarded I handicap parking like SKRRRRRR!

Yo fuck federale, I smoke medicali
B-I-G Sean don, Juan Perion
Bitch fuck with me, I bet I make it work

Fuck with me get a room for daisies on the dirt
I prefer brown liquor, brown ladies, brown Louis Vuitton
Condom on 'fo I go to work, that's my uniform
Nigga I used to eat mayonnaise sandwiches
By candle lit, and that’s cause the power’s out
From barely managing to mansions
Where ho’s call me Mr. Anderson
Command a bitch, no I don’t own the pussy I just sample it
I got a couple marbles missing I know
Now there’s marbles all on the floor
On the bathroom, kitchen and stove
I got bitches on my cellular callin' and confessing
But I don’t reply cause thats the clearest way to send a message
Paper running through my jugular
I’m blowing loud, throwing thous, getting drunk
You know my style
And my momma still say she proud, that’s mula


I'm winning, I don't owe nann nigga shit
Came in this motherfucker by myself
Smoking on strong, and holding on my dick like AH
My gold on, I'm the bomb, I'm talking goldmine
Nigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline
And I touchdown, goal line, y'all ain't killing shit
*Brrrraatttt* Shoot every nigga in your clique
I'm on one, let me jog your memory
Me and Nells on the milerun, uh, shawty gonna need her drawers done
Eat her pussy til' it's all gone, uh
And I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me
Two niggas with guns, snatch yo' wallet
That's pickpocket, want my I.D
And I spaz on em'
Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'
Got a new chopper and that bitch still got a tag on it
If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
So I'm about to be, dumb as fuck, cause' God blesses fools in badges
When I was fifteen I was felon
When you were fifteen you were yelling
Mama come get this nigga off my fucking melon, DAMN IT!


Gotta get it my medula
Nigga hula-hoop with the mula
Everyday that I wake I say grace
Hallelujah welcome back like Mase
Bitches only fuck niggas with the cream
A nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date
Ay, they say we can't maintain
Only real niggas remain
'Ye say that we the new slaves
I need to ball with a chain
I got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month
With some twins so big she can put em' in a bunk
Ooh I love it when she drop it and spread it like 
When I see the camel all I wanna do is hump
Okay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name
Got a mural on the wall I'mma legend
Okay, I'm from the motor city and been have drive

Okay, we all in the game and we ballin' the same but
Home team nigga thats a blessing

So good it can get me into heaven, nigga




Every time you call
You know I'm gonna come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya
Every time you call
You know I'ma come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya

At the same time
Put you on a ride of your life
And meet you there at the same time
Same place, same time
Every time you call
At the same time, same place, same mind
At the same time, same place, same mind

Who overdue for a night off?
Left the crib, I get you right off
How soon is too soon?
I see you every full moon, blue moon
We never did the relationship, it gets too messy
But if we keep messing with the wrong people
At the right place, at the right time, we might let it
You remember when you came to Sweden
I came too and we treated the hotel room
Like the Garden of Eden
Chill, I won't tell all your secrets

Look, we in tune, we in sync
Eye to eye, don't need to blink
We been here, don't need a drink
I bring my A-game
And put you right where you need to be
Look I fuck you, touch you, tease you
Have you learning things about you
No one could teach you
I see in you seein' me
Tell me what you see in me

Every time you call...




There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah

All I want's 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

Only real niggas so I know that you still gon' be absent
I feel like I'm the black Brad Pitt when I wake up to fuckin' an actress
We just shot a movie last night on the couch and I swear that that shit is a classic
If I want it, I need it, I need it, I have it, hit so much it's a habit
I'm greedy, I'm greedy, man fuck it, I'm greedy
Her titties so big that I nicknamed them DeeDee
I know that the devil is callin'
Man fuck that weak-ass nigga, let it keep ringin'
Right now I'm connected with Jesus, on threeway with Yeezus
We just signed a treaty, I'm on the couch like "Free my niggas!"
But niggas cannot get a freebie
If I'm in the field then you know that I TD
Overtime, all the time, man I repeat it
I need some good pussy and Posturepedic
Stressin' so hard think my hairline receded
I say how I say and I feel how I feel
And I won't take it back, it's no need to recede it
You stuck on a bitch?
Well I stuck to the script all my life, ain't no need to re-read it
If you got my email, you's a millionaire
If you got my cellphone, you's a realionare
I ain't been home in months but bitch I'm still the mayor
That Detroit nigga gettin' married but I'm still a player

I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh



Cool cool cool cool
Yup, finally famous nigga

Ok, I get lost in the night
Faded off of that brown
We can take shots of that white
Realest niggas around
Tell me would you like it, would you like it if I let you call me Big
Take it to the D, I can show you where I live
Take it to the penthouse and show you how to live
And treat it like it ain't shit

Now ask me how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
Yea tell me how it feel, how it feel, how it feel
Man, to be around a nigga this real
You know I came up, came down
Turn every dream I had real
So tell me how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
Man to be around a nigga this real

You know I need everything in plural
That's benji's and euro's
I just came back from that Paris
My life is moving in turbo
My pinky ring just dingling
Look how I'm sipping my merlot
Look how I'm hittin' my herbal
Praise God, church ho
What the fuck is you saying?
B.I.G, I'm the mayor in the bitch
Ol' fur coat looking like a bear in this bitch
OH! fuck is you wearing? that's embarrassin shit
Man and to my new girls that's hearing this shit
You fucking with an OG, you should cherish this shit
Man they tell me that they love me, I ain't hearing that shit
They trynna get up in my will and inherit that shit
That's why I'm faded, I'm wasted
I'm living life like it's no jail
House bigger than a hotel
But these hoes tell
So I still take their ass to the hotel
And my ho tell
I got a bad bitch with that body
And a badder bitch in that lobby
Boy that's just how I got it
When I..


Bad bitches that came through
I'm hitting all that I aim to
So stoned I can't move
So stoned I can't move
She go either way like it's game two
She look at her phone praying it ain't you
Living out all the rumors
Then afterwards, say it ain't true
Man I'm daydreaming while sexing
Her screams remind me I'm in it
And all this champagne that I'm popping
Reminded me that I'm winning
I know we shouldn't get so high
Yea, remind me that when I'm finished
But this the life we chose
It's the only life that we know
Reminiscing when I had no job
Back when I woulda robbed yo job
Me and my niggas on the streets dog
Throwing signs up like we roadside
Now the suits and pasta both bowtie
My Greek girls scream "opa"
My Spanish girls scream "no más"
And all the Black girls scream "don't stop!"




I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

I do It
For the city, man

Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free-throwed in ice
Debating with the Reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I've lived a couple lives
Like why? Cause I stunt? Bag the tree like it's fall?
The girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river
They never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card
Nigga riding low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said "Me and your grandma proud"
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Man, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs


But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve
Throwing West side up like Pac up
Where they pop your block up, b-blocka big poppa flock off
You holy lil whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it
Rockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded
I'm in the Obama suite, you one below in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?
20k for the fit because it's 24 carats
I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-town repping
Making all these niggas who second-guessed regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie
And when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man, she almost cried when she see me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy


Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene
Every week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's angel, I even got red wings
Headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
It's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring
Tell me that wasn't the verse of the year
Man, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible
And what these niggas could barely see into optimal
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
Said I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication
And I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'mma be the man til my fucking expiration


BIG, I do it, this goes out to my muthafucking city of Detroit
Westside to be exact, right over there on Northlawn



Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga
Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas
Back when Iceberg and Girbaud
Was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas
Spending my last on the shit that won't last
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass
Overdress to undress that ass, god bless that ass
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer
Riding around like we dumber on dumber
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer
What happened to those days? I really do wonder
When all I did was safe sex, latex
The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade AIDS test fuck
But I ain't flunk once
Back before I got drunk once
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze
My homies would call and say, "nigga, come roll"


Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile, they call that the better mile
Tryna get a house up in the woods off on 11 Mile, bet it now
One time for the D, Girls that hold me down Corretta style
Free Juan, let him out
And everything I want off in the world is a must-have
I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking "fuck rap"
Cause there's niggas in the streets
Getting money under my nose that I must stash
I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit
Ask "why the attitude?" cause bitch, you deserve that shit
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain
A sane brain and mind in a city of AKs and K9s?
When only language they know English and gang signs
Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll


Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?



Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

Tear your ass apart when you swim with sharks
Honestly, I'm over her and her lies
Ok, me and Lil Metro, rockin' new retros
Take off your dress, that's the new dress code
Fuck the professor, I'm too professional

I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang

Dior on my suit, I'm the troop

I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas love to the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck

I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two now what have I gotten into
Trying to cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking my mental

Big blunts of that kush, ducked off in that Phantom
Can’t no nigga do like me, this life I live outlandish
Bunch of hoes in my mansion, get trippy of them bars
I don't do no handcuffing; toss 'em to my dawgs
Bout' to start a bank, all this money that I make
Sour diesel smoking, Memphis nigga getting paid
Bunch of bad bitches, beggin' Juice to fuck
Drinking 'til I throw up, smoking 'til I'm stuck
Loud kush, you can hear it when I walk by
The room is moving side to side, I'm feeling hypnotized
Getting faded in the Phantom, ain't no stopping a riot
These niggas smoking dirt, actin' like they high


Rollin' weed while I'm sexin', rollin' weed while I drive
Rollin' weed while I'm rollin' weed, gettin' high when I'm high
I be gettin' high when I'm hot, gettin' high when you not
Gettin' high, on the low, gettin' high, oh my god!
I just ate a edible, edible
Swear to god I feel incredible
Swear that my texting is no longer legible
I got the pussy you put on the pedestal
Tell her to leave and come bring me back revenue
Gettin' paid down down down to the decimal
Medical vestibule, I'm so professional
My life's a fesitval, I'm just so messed up though - in the mental
I feel like I just jumped out the window
Rollin' OG, kush, purp and indo
Right here, outdoor, in the endo
Weed is my crescendo
Okay, so now we rollin', and she just popped her a pilly
Got her feeling all silly, rollin' paper from Philly, whoa


She asking me questions even though she know I don't know
Her pussy the best and she give the best blowjobs on blow
She love the way that I dress and the way that I stroke
She said she never sipped lean, I said I never did coke
I'm good, I'm smokin', I'm leanin', I'm trying to stay focused
Got my loc's on the chieffin', hope these mollies ain't bogus
We got hoes in the front, got lean in the back
Gettin' head in the back, got fix in the 'Lac
Got Xannies on deck
Bitch, take these shots to the neck, we gots to connect
We off in this club, purple Sprites like it's nothing
Bitch just told me she ain't coming home with me less we fucking
And she got a friend, and they got some mans
Please don't mention yo nigga because I don't care about yo man
Now me and two hoes we on
Let's eat these shrooms 'til they gone
Now we having a threesome in the whip on the way home




Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go on and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life’d it
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch?
I’m moonwalking
And my middle name Michael, ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title, ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’ma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories

Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back

Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great?
How many missed calls til you considered fake?
How many dreams til it's considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes
You don’t know how that shit feels mentally
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say in memory
I’m praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories


Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Mailed one when I heard Unique had died in that crash
Seems like yesterday I just seen her smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, light will swallow the dark
Hurtin' with my Mama looking at cribs we can't purchase
Houses bigger than the Palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles, I'm marathoning
To the money and you just running off in a circle
I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purse
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first then I have the memories



Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs

*someone knocks at the door*
*Big Sean singing*



Uh huh, Rob Got Beats on the beat
We Ready? Yeah
Man this like one of my favorite Beyonce songs, man
What up though, Bey? Yeah
Sean Don

Man, this one for the ones who hold me down so we forever on the rise
Long as I got charts, it's never me, myself & I
Straight up, champagne
Man this one for the ones who cop the album and they ain't need a receipt
All the internet plumbers, you know looking for the leaks
Been trying to find middle ground, like yellow lines in the street
This show is just getting started, don't worry man take a seat
I got mom and bro around like whats better than the family
Did a show at House of Blues that shit was better than the Grammy's
On the phone with my dad trying to handle whats out of hand
Funny man what all those times meant to us
Girls ask me why they call me big, that shit ambiguous
Rappers who was killin shit, lately I can't feel that shit
Ya'll used to didn't feel my shit and now ya'll like "you hear this shit?"
Detroit niggas, say whats up doe, where I be
Fresh as my nigga IB, what up to Don C
The most improved player, watch me turn that I to a V
On my third LP but by the time its IV
That's the fourth, don't be surprised if I'm in first with high leads
We came a long way from having hands together like God Please
Do I really gotta emphasize, my mind spaced out
Yeah I call that bitch the enterprise
I hop up on the song with Em, Jay, and K, watch me hold my own
Bitch it's Sean
Oh boy, I spit that spiritual
Yeah I'm the underdog but Underdog was a superhero too
And my city going through hell, they need a miracle too
You're more about showing off, I'm more about show and prove
Ya'll braggin about so and so, like "Oh, he really it?
The new nigga in rap? Well, can he really spit?"
Or do he just hide behind his skits like half of these rappers do
And then ya'll fucking go and praise him and his bitch like they savior of this shit
I'm like "Aw, man. Here we go"
I'm not the same man I was a year ago
I learned that life could be a merry-go
Moving at a stand still is the scenario
I also learned some girls can fit the stereotype if they got a stereo
Crazy what a cold bitch'll do for palm trees
Type that can't hold my hand even if they palm read
Got a good girl at home, yeah that's all me
I gave my number out on the outro I'm like "call me", real nigga
Since they cut my umbilical, I pass weed in my physical
Yeah my woman is vegan, she got my ass trying different food
I got her listenin to music that she wouldn't listen to
Got her vibin to Nas, she like "Man, This what I been missin, boo?"
I'ma do what I didn't do, all the ridicule is just fuel
I'ma take this little profit, I gotta flip it, no reciprocal
Nigga, fuck open arms, nigga open the safe
Respect in this bitch like  a gun on my waist
Rappin like I got a gun in my face
I treat my life like I be runnin a race
Supa Dupa flow, up up and away
You at the top, well I'm on the way
I'ma come for your spot then I cum in your face
I been trying to make I gotta have it to a habit
Addicted to the mathematics, I'ma add-it addict
Beware of the niggas who abandon when your shit was abandoned
But there for the mansion
Then hit after hit after hit
Somebody tell me what's the fuckin batting average
Dark Sky Paradise, you niggas can have it
Clique rainin so hard, you can white water raft it

Man, we just fucking around, man
Just off the top, on the spot, just fuckin around
We was in three different cities today, man

Hey the album out tomorrow, man I can't believe this shit
I can't believe it
Hey waddup doe Detroit
Man waddup doe to my family, my friends, my fans
I do this for ya'll
We put our hearts into this shit
My boys damn near gone
I don't know its like 5 in the morning
We ain't slept in fuckin days
We do this from the heart man
And we did out our way
Boss up, it's time to get it, yeah
Countin blessings over money
Straight up



I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

Tequila glasses, shots to the head cuz some memories they need assassins
Got a quarter pound of purp an eigth of gin and half my friends
Gone, Gone
Man fuck it though, not too good with fractions
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking
Cuz when people give you a hand they want an audience back
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic
Pop pop that AK take candids
I aim for the sky, never landed
And yup
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers trynna get rich off me
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin off credit, these niggas need debit
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first

But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

Fuck nah
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out
They got that work, and thank God for yay
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is


Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin I'm just busy on camera
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance
When it's all finished
Guess that depends on how you live
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did

But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?





Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy

Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas
Hit the club, lose seven Gs, film it all on 7D's
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest of my G's rest with a piece
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team
Same show, different seats, same game, different league
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Bitch

I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown
Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well
I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do

Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy
Use to roll around in that Toyota rolling seven deep, damn

Bitch
Bitch



I swear this life was made for us
All these late nights is made for us
Tell the old ones please pray for us
Tell 'em this Sunday to pray for us
I swear this life was made for us
No such thing as getting paid too much
Going all night, please pray for us
Going all night, please pray for us

I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

I woke up early nigga
I had a dream I died at thirty nigga
Aw, twenty something doing real life
To make a million dollars, what it feel like?
It feel like I need to know her right then
It feel like young Ray Allen with the white twins
Popping harder than MJ with the white skin
I take you way back, I'm talking Tommy Hilfiger
Wave cap, way back
Back when we said we need the wrist rocky, ASAP
I had the Casio, time to replace that
Don't make me snap back, back to the TI$A  snapback
Khaled with the flow, you know, they don't want you to snap, yep
Don't make me get the car seat, niggas know I'm they pap, pap
Boy they owe it to me like Leonardo DiCap, facts, yep
Look fresh out the deck, getting spoiled rich
And I'm just tryna spend it all with a loyal bitch
I been choosing wrong girls my whole life
I hope I don't fail the test again
And have her going through my texts again
Religiously, like it's the old testament
Then end up single alone, and stressed again, saying...

I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I guess I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that we can't try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

Look, thinking to my self what true success is
To some it's to get a job, retire, and move to Texas
I take the path less travelled and give them new directions
I'm still taking more risks than I do suggestions
When I was young I was addicted to the Wrestlemania
Maybe cause I had my back against the ropes
And I grew up Stone Cold just ready to face the Undertaker
I treat my enemies like fuckin' neighbors
Yeah you can borrow the style, and this and that for a while
But trust, I'll be back to fuckin' take it
Then take it back to before it all started adding up
Back when it was happening but wasn't happening fast enough
And the job applications was the only papers stackin' up
And we was contemplating black-masking out the back of trucks, yup
Do you know how it feel, to have no chill?
And love super thick girls with a supermodel feel
And try and do it bigger than everyone around you ever did and ever will
Then put it in your will
It ain't about where you at, boy, it's about where your mind's at
Got my first job and realized I need two hundred times that

I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I guess I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

I swear this life was made for us
All these late nights is made for us
Tell the old ones please pray for us
Tell 'em this Sunday to pray for us
I swear this life was made for us
No such thing as getting paid too much
Going all night, please pray for us
Going all night, please pray for us, oh God



They say I’m too fake, fuck it I’m paid
I can’t even find an empty spot inside my safe
I got Carties on my eyes, Louis on my case
Lobster, shrimp, and calamari right here chilling on my plate
They tell me I’m on time, even when I’m late
Even if it’s a lie they say everything is great
I’m grabbin’ the fattest asses, just to see ‘em shake
I swear I’m too real to be, I’m too real to be livin’ so fake

Look out!
Cause I’m just too fake for the world
I know it’s just a game to me
I’m just too fake you see
I wish I didn’t have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It’s breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don’t like it but it’s true

"Yeah I know Sean, I swear that nigga ain’t shit
Known him for forever and he ain’t on the same shit
It breaks my heart when all the kids be yelling 'You the mayne, Big'
He ain’t no hometown hero, he on that LeBron James shit"
Man I tell them suck my dick then choke on a nut
Cause when they see me it’s "Oh, It's Big, What's up?"
Man for the team, man, fam, or regime
Might knock down any door, open it up
Got on and now you startin’ actin’ different huh?
No really I wasn’t fuckin’ with you from the beginnin’ bruh
Here we are, here we go, my circle tighter than a Cheerio
People want a handle like silver spoons
People want a handout like here you go
Man, the realest nigga I know is inside the mirror bro
And these fools be trippin’ like a suitcase, a shoelace
They too fake, and I’m too real, yeah, boy


Fake it til you make it
What happens when you do?
Friends turn to strangers, so I’m a stranger, too
They want this or that
Boy gotta hustle like a flip or pack
Year a go a nigga wasn't gettin' scratch
When I hit the booth I came up with a sick attack
Oh yes, feelin’ so strong we about to take the game like Conquest
Wish we fail, but they check pre-sales, and a hater gets proven wrong, yes
They just bantering, calls I’m not answering
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
But Chiddy jigga with these girls we be on the next
And they get mad cause we really don’t respond to text
Yeah, they say I, may be just on the shady side
Maybe I, grow so much and I smoke so much got a lazy eye
Yeah I’m too gone, this the new shit to get loose on
The boy Chiddy and Sean on a new song
If you ain’t with it, tell me what the fuck you on
I said I in heads, made it off of Big chance
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implant
But I'm real



Welcome to Hell's paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
Seven, eleven, or a pair of eyes
As I’m looking at her smearing eyes
She yelling “Take them glasses off, yo eyes are the only things that’s not lying”
Not caring to the point that I stopped lying
I tell her I feel the same
She tell me “Nigga quit playing, you the only one that’s not crying”
You said you wasn’t on no steal your man shit
If I broke it off now we won’t be on some friend shit
Man, what goes around comes around, that ceiling fan shit
I broke the levy to your eyes that I don’t give a damn shit

And time after time, it’s the same old shit
Think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes
And I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it’s too late

Well, wake up then, shit, call your ex and make up then
What was no strings attached got tangled when
Fun stopped being fun, and feelings tried to finagle in
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one
You need a good guy and I'm already not one
She said we lost a kid already, I'm already not that young
My biological clock is ticking, I'm not just tryna have fun
Shit's way different from us first chilling
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending
Wish we could fast forward time and reverse feelings
She said you good either way
When it was her last night nigga and me today
You the man, huh? Getting all the TNA
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?
Huh, and so on and so on
And the shit just always goes on
Nothing about us feeling right
But she'll be back before the end of the night

And time after time, it’s the same old shit
Think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes
And I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it’s too late
Cause two can’t be in first place

I love, I love her



Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I’m the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame
I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho
I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in
Call me Ron Bergundy ya’ll the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I’m the new shit
And guess what it’s true bitch

We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it

I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
Its so amazing
You woulda thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine

Ay look
I need less friends more bread
Less talk more head
I’m just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team handed my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I’m the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I’m who they going ape shit over
I’m who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money’s over all
I’m tryna move my momma from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can’t stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit
Bitch I’m living everyday month yearly
Yell until you muthfuckers hear me
We made it




I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

I hope it's not too late
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Riding in a Chevy that shoulda been a Mercedes
Trying to keep my head above water so I stayed out the Navy
I, I made a promise to my girl
So I'mma leave town and bring back the whole world
So I bought a ticket, took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace and the first thing she said was
Like "nigga I got needs too
I found a man that gave me what I need now I don't need you
I barely got a text, a call back, you old lying ass nigga
You a dog, out here chasing paper, fucking bitches, nah
Nah nigga you too late
Live with it, now you got a roommate"
My homie served ten years it's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Riding around doing my thing
Is it too late to be trying to live dreams
And turn them all real, reality is just a technicality
So is being fake so don't tell me that I'm too late

I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak, I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
Well how long would you take
Waiting's got me here in the first place
Another second, I'd be second maybe third in the worst case
Now on display are my word plays
Moving weight - it's such a trap
Move and wait you can't do that
I know I'm dope man but I can't move crack
And it's such a fractured way of thinking 'bout your plans
But I try to bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago-land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the sedans
Ride with Mr. Right-On-Time or stay Ms Another Chance
Man - redirected at the girls
Not an ultimatum just an option in this world
Where things come and go when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot, huh

I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late, yeah
Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls
Is it too late even though I'm the shit
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick, bitch

I do it, too late for what
If I want it I need it if I need it I got it
Finally Famous in this, G.O.O.D



{Young Chop on the beat}

Yup.. money, money, money

I woke up - boy it’s time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up - feelin' like the mothafuckin’ realest
Living but it’s time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

Tryna get it every day
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way

You hit the hood and post up, I’m gon’ get it ‘til I’m filthy rich
That’s stretched out, ‘til I’m in the back, stretched out, drinkin' Ace
‘cause I’m decked out, whole hood with me; need a guest house, yea a guest house
Lately I been getting like mo’ ass and less mouth
Man, when they see this crib, they gon’ start to think about cribs
Been dealt with real life too long, now it’s time to live

Politician, bad bitch, swallowtician, gotta get it
I’ma wake my ass up, get it all back, thank God


Now I been killing shit, I gotta say, my pit blue, my buffs gray
With a hint of white, sipping Henny white, livin' like I won’t see the night
A real playa like Pinky, when I’m in the game, I TD
And I’m all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, that’s 3D
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side
Last night, I was so drunk, I felt high

And go get everything they never gave me

Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake
I’ma do dessert first, I don’t even gotta wait
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray
By the way, my jewelry appraised, it’s a couple K
On the lake, I’m out of the state, at my hideaway
Like Bruce Wayne, I’m saving the day, and I’m getting bank
I’m foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way
I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I pro up
Ok it’s Earlly Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold

Go on, roll that weed nigga, cause I'm stressed out
L-V checked out
Bad bitch, chest out
No wonder why Mrs. Right just keeps on getting left out
Oh well that's everything I'm not concerning, fuck it
I'm on the top floor getting brains, higher learning
Getting higher earnings and my desires yearning
Running through that paper like my attorney
Hundred blunts rolled, you can smell the fire burning
I'm in the fast lane, you can smell my tires burning
Exercise, flex on guys
Model chick
Sex on thighs
Bump a lot
A Lexus drive
I might let Alexis drive
Jesus chain, testify
I over accessorize
Test her out, now she gon' need a stretcher when I stretch her out
When it's time to speak, bet all of ya'll listen
When you up in the party
Why is all the broads missing
And I just drop lines like a nigga gone fishing
Man and I be on them posters like that nigga gone missin'
And I spit that er-retarded shit just call it autism
I'm so Hollywood that I might make your bitch audition
Before we cut
Cut, cut
Movie time, cut
I'ma dick her down, you gon' pick her up
And I'm unusual as shit
I'm Superbad, your girl probably doodling my dick
And it's a couple screws up in my head that could use a fucking wrench
And I'm just looking at the game like
Damn, they could use a fucking bench, bitch
And my name all up in the rafters
She gon' make me cum, I bet that money come faster
Kanye first, then I'm coming after
And Lou' Vuitton shoes ho
Dons and the Jaspers
Who her, I ran through her walls
Made her scream and disappear but hell no my name is not Casper
Boy, what the fuck these rappers sound like
Just a whole bunch of my sound bites
First whip, garbo
Second whip, Largo
Don’t worry bout my niggas Thurgood Marshall
Bank account got me feeling Well, Fargo
Balling til I get a Milicic Darko

These niggas sit down



Ho, I got my cell phone ringin', nowadays it's hard to get me
Nine times out of ten, if you ballin' then you busy
Sippin' Henney, sippin' Rémy like it's Chrissy
And I pop that champagne like it's my birthday, really it's a Wednesday
All about the benjis, I've been gone all year
Came back, I swear you niggas ain't done moved an inch or centi
Mind movin' like a semi, pop pop pop, the truth is
I feel like masseuses when I back off in this bitch, I feel the tension
Ho, you've got your hand out, what that mean, like gimmie?
What you need your ass, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys
I know thug ass niggas that'll run in your house
You lock the door, you lock the window, they gon' come down the chimney
Skinny nigga but I walk inside this bitch like Dikimbe
I'm the Laurent St., I keep a angel face with me
You got your hand out, ho, again, what that mean, like gimme?
What you need you, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys
If a bitch don’t suck my dick, I swear that shit just offend me
Ho, I'm really from Detroit, I went to Cass and not Renni
Actin' like you can't die tonight, what, you gon' come back like Kenny?
I roll up spazzin' like Timmy, hand is attached to the benjis

Atta-tached to the benjis, not attached to these feelings
I don't love these hoes, I'd rather fuck me a million, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it

If I said it, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it

Nigga, I be the most imitated, my crib renovated
My old bitch assessin', my new bitch is waitin'
Just like a doctor with my operation
I got me my check-up but still got no patience
All of these texts and calls I'm not takin'
My phone overflowin', that shit can get drainin'
I signed up with Ye, and he just explained it
How we gotta get it like Jay-Z and Damon
Did back in the year that they came in
Stuck between a ROC and the G.O.O.D. place is where I'm remainin'
Bitch, it's finally famous
What you do in a day I could do before breakfast
Young nigga T-rexing
My old bitch wish that she would've got pregnant
Tryna be the first lady because my wrist just won a presidential election
Bitch, and I hope you offended
I said it, I meant it, I hope that recorded
I just broke a Guinness
I flew in from Italy through the Pacific
Shout out to Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Scott Disick
When you see my pretty face, shut the fuck up and kiss it
And just know that my hands


If I said it, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it

It's goin' down, down in the earliest round
And baby, we'll be goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
I've got a loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
It's goin' down, down in the earliest round
And baby, we'll be goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
I've got the safety off, cocked back, ready to pull it



I done fell asleep fucking last night
That’s how much I don’t sleep nigga
Finally famous nigga

And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
Let’s get it

Today is a good day
I wish a nigga would day
Ride through the hood day
Ride through the hood where I would stay
If I wasn’t me, wasn’t committed
I told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
You ain't alive if you ain't living that’s the motto
And imma’ probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin

And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
Let’s get it

Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga
It’s the motherfucking world nigga
Getcha some time to just do it how I done it
First up on the first cause’ first of all you gotta want it
Re-up time for every penny, never fronted
Showroom floor, paid every penny then I stunted
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman
TS4 with 23’s I’m talking jumpmans
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush
Just don’t get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken
If them niggas think I’m riding with that, them niggas tripping
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause’ imma’ grinder
Told my O's, "I'm hiding you here, so they won’t find you"
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?
Bet you one thing, I ain’t talking no marijuana
That’s whats wrong with these niggas they think it’s about shine
You niggas get back to your grind, I think it’s about time

And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
Let’s get it

They say it’s my time according to my Rolex
I’m bout to fuck the game, then your ho next
I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch
Press the fast forward button, I’m pushing a foreign something
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
It’s time for a new crib, it’s time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie that’s just loose change
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood you’d say that nigga is blessed
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though
The hustle’s who I represent, Dough Boyz we in this bitch

And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
Let’s get it

Detroit, once the backbone of this country
Now it’s the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million
To under 700,000 in a matter of years
The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together
To make it through these tough times






And it's falling off the side like back fat
Giving girls rides to the crib not a rat trap
Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps
I want all these snapped in his back in the day
Like a tall tee tag
I need that whip clean G
What's the weather gon be
Drop top, no drips on this upholstery
Supposed to be headed downtown
Carwash like blaow
And my girl drive the chevy while I break this tree down
Roll the window back up
Good, turn it back up
Ugh, UGK
Diamonds & Wood
Hold up, yea roll up
That's tight, that's right
You do this right, you might have the time of your life

Coming from the Westside but my fitted say Sox
Where you get banged on if you in it or not
Looking like Cain cause I watch Menace a lot
And I'm tryna fuck your friend so is she with it or not
Shout out to ATL cause I'm in Lennox a lot
And I dont like looking, I go in there to cop
Houston High Rollers, I go in it a lot
Spending money with the strippers you go in there to watch
Blowin on L's, smelling like Chanel
You say you the man but dawg these bitches can't tell
But ladies love Dom cause I'm gettin that mail
To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail
Put the tens up and start breaking out the twelves
Bet I have your girlfriend shaking out her heels
We shaking all deals
And chasing all meals
I'm popping all over how you haters all feel

Smoke good, fuck better
Count money, what's better
These lil niggas can't hang
Big shit popping bitch and big my first name
I'm a Westsider, Detroit player
Fuck around and I might bring back gators
Everyday I leave the crib with no money
And come back later with that muthafucking paper
Finally famous over erything thats just how I feel bitch
They trying to stop my shine
They yellin hit the kill switch
Wrong nigga to deal with
Less you doing a deal with
Grind hard, thats how I was built bitch
Whoa there, whoa there
I'm who everybody know here
I come through in the club and get more money than promoters
Oh thats your girl
I see her at my show there
I be off in the hood I bet you dont ever go there
Ayy so slow there boy
Don't go there boy
It's people you dont know there boy
Young nigga that's addicted to the Polaroids
And I gave these niggas more lines than corduroy
And my bitches be gorgeous boy
Showtime I hope you record em boy
I'm out here

Let's reel half of a brick and bring it back to the kitchen
See the crack its fizzing
Then bring it back when its finished
Jimbo put that on a dish
And Chizzel will bag it and sell it
Then boldly factor the digits
To know the cash that I'm flipping
Six gonna get stashed in the ceiling
6-O's in traffic I'm pitching this o
That one get split and broke to halves
And this one his o
And that one is his
And this o I'm bagging and this one
This o the last
The nigga Ro is a crackilitician
Rolling the ave cause I'm getting dough in that slab
Cause I'm getting over, they mad
I just grill 'em bro, with my mag on my briches
Know I'll blast if you tempt him
Bro you will crash in your whip with holes in your back cause you hit
Going as fast as your engine go
When you smash in the strip smoking a bag with your bitch
Choking, gasping for breath holding
Grabbing your chest from boldly magging that tech
Unload it faster than Vick's concreture school craft to the the sick
Bomb as a brick

I be frustrated with the way that shit's been aging
And I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation
Like, maybe Malaysia to escape the meditation
I'll just eat, pray and wait for my day of revelation or I'll
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only grow weed
Cause this, Naomi flowing show gets pretty lonely
Don't nobody ever know you
Everybody call you homie
Mony Mony they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low they won't be picking up the phone
And when Im on the microphone all you wanna-be's can blow me
So, take this boner to the dome you little bo-peeps
That may be inapropy but Im certainly no sheep
See, I only lead in this game of entertainment
Roth and Big Sean
We on Finally Famous

Yea, now roll ten of em up
Fuck the rules we Auntie Anne's pretzel bendin em up
Don't give a fuck/Word to your daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Regular White Owl Cigarillo, no Flavors
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
Smooth, like a baby's ass
Mercedes pass
The ladies ask can they be next cause I'm kicking their favorite raps
Life is playing 2k and kicking raps all day by the lake
Smoking truth till I collapse in broad day
I'm surfing, radical
Gnarly, far out
My stoner chicks gather round soon as I break the jar out
Ay baby girl pass the blizz-ard
Your woman chose me so I had to jizz her
Don't be sleeping or taking no cat naps
We leaders of the new school with these fat raps



You're kinda large
My pussy almost jump out my drawers ooh shit
Ooh I wanna ride this big pig
Ooh I wanna put the dogs on the head of this good motherfucker
Ooh now look at here baby
Don't pay that no mind, it's just that my pussy done got nervous
And a dick like that will make any pussy excited



Shit they got a picture of that shit?
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now

Hell yeah nigga high right now
That's the reason I said "hi" right now
Come have the time of your life right now
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now
This shit classic, they ask "where your outfit from?"
Plead the Saks Fifth, first class
Only culture games and practice
Oh you athletic? Shit, show me on the mattress
Cause it's already night time
And I feel like the right time
Twisting up my fingers
Like the young P-A-C, B-I-G but she just call me D-A-D
I do it

Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night

Fancy things...
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..

Hell yeah, nigga gone right now
That's why we should get gone right now
I'm trying to get you home right now
I bet I could turn you on right now
Really I can't call it
Stress turned me into a weed-head
And parties into an alcoholic
And money turned me into a workaholic
And money turned her into a twerkaholic
Yeah do it, do it, do it with no hands
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches
Ain't about the cars, bout that nigga who is in it
Start it up, guaranteed I'mma finish
In the nighttime, I feel like the right time
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
Make sure the muthafucking ice cold
My jewelry is ice-cold, stone is albino
Cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno
Let's give em a light show

I ain't Paul McCartney or John Lennon
I ain't buying Beetles, I'm buying Benzes
They mad at you mamacita
Cause them bitches look like Bobby Bonilla

I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

I play the keys, handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet like cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once, trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, Argo shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tippin' strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talkin' shit but I can get her titties lifted
My new crib got its own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor, wet as salt water
Underboss I'll just play the holes like a golf course

I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

One hundred keys, one hundred please
My gesundheit could make a whole city sneeze
Walked the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves
So they swarm to my honey comb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sound like, money counters' sound bites
Machine gun fire, name ringin' through the town like
Church bells ringin', know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees, I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
The Iron Man Audi, let the top striptease
My life's in slow motion, but the watch screamin' freeze
Ugh, young nigga gettin' money
The feds' dragnet couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em, wrapped like a mummy

I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

B.I., boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
Baguettes lookin' like a hundred lights
Man when Blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred tight
Every wrong I do I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got her for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they rob Pintos and could afford Enzos
Cause everybody knows keys open doors, but bricks open windows
Counting a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I'll send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4 by 4s

I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony



The best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
And that's what you gon' get anytime you fuckin' with us
Finally Famous, what's up?

I'm on the west side of my city
Ridin' round like a tour guide
With that white girl she got a tongue ring
That might as well be a bullseye
She half naked walking 'round this bitch
I almost thought I was poolside
Like her tubes tied but that's suicide!
One time for my niggas who made something out of nothing -
Cause you could lose it all my nigga look at David Ruffin
"You could lose it twice as fast as you got it"
Got it - that's what my grandma told me
And you've got to be a dumb dumb dumb motherfucker
Not to listen to what you hear from the OG's
Rollin' OG 'til I G-O
Yeah G-O, nigga, add an O-D
That's what I rep, nigga, 'til I O-D
Collecting everything that this world owes me
I told my Momma grab you any kind of car
Girl cause you my shining star, I love you everywhere you are
Back to it - to the game I am committed
Workin' overtime like we get paid off commissions
And my wrist bliss, work
Ms. Gliss, man I ain't got time like my wristlit
No bitch fit, just a fit bitch
Who's only job is to make me feel terrific

Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on

I'm on the east side of my city
Ridin' round like it's "Doomsday"
And if you keep pushing my buttons
Might fuck around and be a "Tomb Day"
Don't let go of her hand
Or it might be "Big-Sean-In-Her-Womb Day"
"Congratulations, dog!" man, that's what the whole room say
I want money and security for all of my descendants
We up in Hollywood, tryna get our hands some "in it"
If you don't fuck with my songs
Man, you gotta fuck with the intention
Tryna get my fam and friends-es
Behind Benz-es, and cartier lenses - woah
I believe I can fly, I believe I'm the man
I believe in God
Man, they sending shots, shots, shots, shots
Like they don't believe I can die
Man, fuck whoever used to tell me to stop
A legend in the making -
Fuck whoever told me I'm not

Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on



Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I’m all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it’s not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need

Understand, I am
The renowned, newest talk of the town
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkin’ about
Westside! Tellin’ girls “You should call if you down”
And if my phone doesn’t ring, then leave it after the pound
Cause I be up in the air more than I do on the ground
You’re now rocking with somebody on their fuckin’ bidness
See, I done seen nights turn to days
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades
‘Cause when it turns real, that’s when everyone turns fake
Instead of saying "fuck all of y’all" and turning away
Man, I was cool enough to say “Fuck it” and let ‘em stay
Fuck, I hate to say I told you so
So buying rounds is my way of saying “told you, ho”


Now, I can’t tell what’s a better accessory
My new watch, or the chick that’s standin’ right next to me
Killin’ niggas at rap, but being the man’s my specialty
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Double shots, then reload
Let’s toast to the interns that made it to CEO
Boss player, collectin’ every single check that’s owed out
Puttin’ on a show until everything is sold out
Man, I’m chillin’ with Jays, ‘Ye’s, and Common Senses
It’s crazy when legends are peers and your competition
I would hate to be a almost nigga
I call ya that, ’cause you gossip like y’all almost bitches
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get ‘im
Y’all niggas make me realize how good almost isn’t
Would hate to look back on my life and say “I almost did it”
Fuck that, reflectin’ on the last chain I bought
They on my tracks, waitin’ on the next train of thought
Visualizin’ how the crown might be
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me


This dedicated to my ex girls, both of ‘em
It’s also dedicated to everybody who be talkin’ shit behind my back
And then when I see y’all, y’all act like “Awww, I’m so happy for you”
That’s some bitch-ass shit, nigga

Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go

Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best



Yup, I've done worked too hard

Getting sloppy toppy while I’m rolling kamikaze
Skeet, skeet, swear I made the pussy fire hydrant
She up and down the pole like she, like she firefighting
Bitch I’m Finally Famous, I do, I do what I want
Money, money, sex and money in the air with an aroma
Swear I got her head banging, banging, might be in a coma
Walk up to the baddest bitch and tell her that I own her

Baby do what you got to do, do what you got to do

Two hoes, score them like a fucking fill up
Asian bitches, Wu-Tang, give them RZA
Oh really, Milli Vanilli, faking with me
Bet she lift that ass up high like she hit a wheelie
In the club, be in the back like a Bentley
Niggas pretending to be me, that shit don’t offend me
I’m about my business and this bitch is temporary

Money committed, swear this shit be married

Do what you got to do, what you got to do



I say
I'm still dreaming bigger than I'm living
And just sleeping long enough to dream
Spent long enough in the sheets
It's time to turn it to the real thing
And turn these ideas to milli's
Business into buildings
No girlfriend, you're looking for some feelings
Find a dentist
Me and my crew toured around the world
Shook a million hands
I never made the crowd fans
I made 'em all fam
And came back to the city
That made us all men
Except we kings now
Reflecting, trying to take it all in
I put the city on my back
So that way if I fall
I'm crowd surfing the map
I turn mistakes into lessons
Dead ends to exits
On the journey of my life
So I'm inviting ya'll to get in
Let's go



Yeah, Finally Famous gettin'.. yep
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the
Intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go-go-go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know-ow-ow
Ow-ow-ow {*8X*}

While I'm flying over literally, flying over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto

I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue, I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one; you got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee


...Yeah
Ohh, yeah
...Ohh



Catch me running to the money until my feet lose feeling
Stack it wall-to-wall 'till it's leaking through the ceiling
Man, all fucking hundreds so whats that like a zillion?
Working graveyard shifts cause were finna make a killin'
Went from intern to the owner of the building
To be seeing what I'm seeing
After I've seen what I've seen
It's like acting out a scene from a dream of my dream
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality
And pride that's worth more than a salary
And a text from the girl I love I stopped calling
Sometimes I feel I'm working just to work harder
And then work harder then who worked the hardest
Man the life of a work-a-holic
You either on your work or just working on it


Man fuck it kill'em all we gonna need a ton of flowers
And if you need impossible give me 'bout an hour
It's time to turn a Polaroid into a portrait
Rocking street clothes getting money like I'm corporate
Youngin' getting it isn't life gorgeous?
Bet the crib on 'em and you'll end up with a fortress
And Ima need that new condo, town home, brown stone
Should I fuck with the Dow Jones?
Or maybe I'll put money on the block instead
There's no need to save
I could get change off the street next to the meter maid
Cause I need a main house with a piece of shade
Butler doing such a good job that they need a raise
Bad chick with an Angel ass and an Aalyiah face
Tryna show a little TNA
Hell yeah I'm tryna see the day
Man, life is so bright when you don't see the grey
The new school appointed me to lead the way
A real nigga to the DNA
Me, Mike, Grace, and Dilla
Sticking to the script
And what's-her-name still licking on my tip
Go ahead and tell these bitches who they're fucking with
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Her mouth lookin like Dannon
Because of me and Cannon
And to get where we at she had to suck a hundred dicks

Man I got on Versace shades, Versace belt, Versace shoes
I might've fucked around and been the freshest nigga in the world today
You dont understand man I came from nothing
This what I dreamed about, this what we dreamed about..boyyy
B.I.G. Sean Don nigga, G.O.O.D. Music

Tried to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I could think of was our last fight
I was going to play it on piano
Have the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballot strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sanged
Piece of paper I started with I thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why, cause you made it that way
You made it that way
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you just
A lame who's shit outta luck, crazy ass bitch
I almost wrote you a love song

She threw my watch out the window
Chain in her hand
She running through the crib finding anything she can
Our relationship is not the only thing thats outta hand
She even called my mama like you need to get your man
Cause your son lying on me, I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club tr-tr-try and find a man
Bitch you headed to the club tr-tr-trying to find a man
What is you saying had hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagine in white gowns
So where ya left hand you should let me add a ring to it
Because mr & ms anderson just has a ring to it
She like why you act like that to me and walk right back Mike Jack to me
Every time we fall out I'll throw yo ass out
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me
What the fuck


I think you crazy, crazy, you need medication
You should calm down, you need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations
About how I'm wrong without any explanation
At all before you say another nigga next up
I should call a maid down cause I messed up
But gave you what you need even on them shopping sprees
She said what if we reversed roles
And you were front row cheering at my first shows
And a couple dollars later and some Louis Vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinking that you wouldn't know
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought I'd never do it it even hurt more
And I'll lie about it and you'll find out from the source
Whose word was more truthful then yours
What would you do

And I was so glad I didn't ever pen it
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would've did it would've probably stay with ya
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling you did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I got a new guy thats turning me on
And the big ballot strings are about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote is about to get sanged
A song about our love is going to see the light of day
Why?
Cause you made it that way
Oohhh yeah you made it that way
Ohhhh oh yeahh I was going to write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you're just
A lame who's shit outta luck
I almost wrote you a love song



Yo! It's money time, nigga!
Yezzir, whoa yeah, hey

I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

Okay, "B-I, B-I", bitch I do it to death
If I come with half, bet I leave with the rest
Okay, you might be cool getting 50%
I'm like "fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent!"
Got a million on line 1 and another mil' dialing in
Momma on line 4, telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line 3 telling me how we 'bout to win
You on hold tryna get conferenced in
I ju- I just gotta have it
Imagine and make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see who could get it the fastest
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go

Whoa! The sky never seemed so low
Looking at her like "you never seemed so close"
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, you gotta fake an accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
All my wants into haves and then divided it by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Bigs, greatest of all Seans
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go



I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

And I'm in love with the lights, the love
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old
Table full of new hoes, champagne nuvo
My mind is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend
You know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I'm in Cali
But I just hide my face doing a Errol Flynns
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in em
She got no companion, she's Jenifer Aniston
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend
And again, and again
Pass it to my mans and them
Fucking all the baddest bitches in cities we're landing in!

What happens when it all falls
And the success is all gone
And is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!


I'm in love with the money..
They say that it's the root of all evil
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us
But he will pass around that collection plate
Til it's heavyweight as soon as his speech through
Then hop in that Benz coupe
Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!
But how is it the root of all evil?
If it could take my whole family out to Rio?
No more repo
A depo, just speed boats
Jewelry all gold call me C3PO
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3PO
Cause I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the mics like T.O
So I hate to lose my Mike like Tito



I do it for, everything in life for love and meaning
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next
LA Reid sign checks right after the contract
I always have a crazy flow pockets was on radio
Active cause I guess I was active on a radio
Way back in high school, yeah nigga CT
Where I met my nigga Tone, Pat Piff, and CT
Came out of the slump nigga way before T3
Giving hoes the run around, we just call them track meet
It's funny now when I look back
Cause them times gave me the inspiration that the track needs



Yeah
G.O.O.D Music, ay!

Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker

Skip the jewelry store and grab rocks
Of whatever's in your account
So take that into account
And you best get to count-in'
Before you gets to bounc-in'
Bitch

Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
That she was crazy than a muh-fucker
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
She was crazy than a muh-fucker

This. Bitch. Crazy
Man I must be crazy too
Cuz crazy as she is I couldn't leave her if you paid me to
I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to
D-d-dick her up and now she walkin' like she 82
She get it from her mama
Headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama
Man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money
Not from you?
Believe that, fuck you get my password?
Readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first
I know I should leave her
For damn sure don't, don't need her
Every time I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first

Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
She was crazy than a muh-fucker
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
She was crazy than a muh-fucker
Do it!



My life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string
Clique full of Gs and some bad-ass bitches
Oh, your ear to the streets? Okay, well, holla if you hear us
I keep it G, I keep it G
I keep it G, I keep it G

My life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string
Oh, Jesus, they love me to pieces
Got up in the game cause I was tired of the bleachers
Get rich, repeat it, taste it, I'm delish
Lookin' so good she put me on her fuck for free list
I turn her on 'fore I go in
I swear that pussy keyless
I might let her ride the mic and let her friend come get the remix
Rollin' rich nigga weed, with a rich nigga bitch
Ridin' 'round the city, in a rich nigga whip
Yea a nigga paid a grip, for all this rich nigga shit
And all these bad hoes, they want a rich nigga's dick
O God, this life is such a blessin'
See I smoke 'til I can't smoke no more and drink is no exception
Man these crazy niggas crazy, nigga when you gon' learn yo lesson
They won't talk shit about you plaques, but they gon' talk when you arrested


10 Ben Franklins, nigga, that's a G homie
Flash the pinky ring, baby you can ski on it
Put it in your uterus, U-Haul, I move the shit
Baby I'm a shark and these rappers taste like tuna fish
Look at this, movie with no movie script
Just bought an old-school so that's my newest whip
Cartiers on, I can see all through the shit
I spell southside with an F that stand for foolishness
Fuck that shit, fuck with us, we'll have you in some luxury
I need a stash pot for a couple keys
When I'm in the Gucci store, I spend some G's to wear some G's
If you is a sucker, I'm a charge you ass a sucker fee
Luckily, smoking on that vote for me, Presidential evidence
Truck so big, I can't park it at my residence
Wallet so big, I can't put it in my back pocket
Soon as her ass dropping, the cash dropping


I just turned my old car into a new
My basement into a presidential view
One into two, a milli into a few
Niggas want to see me fall, ah shit
I'll fall off and turn into you
Fuck around, turn this peace sign to a piece
I feel like slappin' a ho
Keep a bad bitch at the passenger door
Never ever break these broads off a lil
Once you give 'em something they be askin' for more
If I run out then I'm snatchin' up yours
Man I remain a quadruple-triple OG, triple OG, triple OG
And that's not a maybe either, nigga, that's fa-sho



Man I got my dark glasses on, cause I'm ready for the big lights
All my money counted, all my rubbers skintight
Me, I always fit out, you was more the in type
I never follow suit, you was more like pinstripes
Riding in Ye's Maybach, smoking so it's cloudy
With three girls who spent all day doing Pilates
Getting money, niggas think I joined illuminati
Throwing west side up, I'm feeling like Killuminati
Now isn't it ironic that I'm in a big body
Paranoid cause every rapper named Big got bodied, boy
And my bitch got body
But I sit her in the back, cause my nigga called shotty!
And I'mma G-O till I'm a OG
Rocking something high end, like a fucking OD
They feel a nigga from NY to the OC
If we down in the 4th quarter, I take it to OT
Take it to 1 and 0, just take it it's on me
Chilling in the hot spot cause I never get cold feet
Nigga, you on the sidelines praying for an audible
Cause when you're legendary everything is quotable
Priceless is affordable, order what you can't afford
Matter fact, order more
And I think I'mma have the same thing
My whole team getting cash, I just call it gangrene
Big is on the track, Ye be on the track
Since when Kobe and LeBron hoop for the same team
Could live my life blindfold
Cause every time my eyes close
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing
Yeah, I just tend to see the same thing
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with GOOD, and been living a changed scene
I'm trying to turn these gray clouds to Vanilla Skies
Camera in my face, I guess the future will be televised
And I'm as underrated as can be, bitch
Fuck it if I'm underrated, I stay on some G shit
Nigga, I chief up, it's December 25
Three hundred and sixty-five, forever puttin' reef up
And your girlfriend forever want to meet her
Tryna see what is in common but my dick is what's between us
Man I break her heart every time I change hoes
I make a new style every time I change clothes
Man they jock my rhymes every time I change flows
One of the few getting change but won't change for it



I say that shit again, I said it once before
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all
I glisten and shine with misses' fine model chick, big behind
Bad enough to skip the line but to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double-0 you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch I am a monster, I belong in District 9
Catch me in my office, office, doing business
Fuck you doing, bullshitting

I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arrivin'
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran
I guess they on son, cause my neck look like horizon
Just a million people behind me and I don't have Verizon
Man I'm chillin with my niggas nigga, and a couple cool bitches
The fuck you doin', bullshittin'

Me and my niggas say it ain't Ton
Hundred pretty girlies singing our song
Yeah I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
And I be blowing on that reefer you can't say that it ain't strong and
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a conehead
When I'm done go ahead, what the fuck this is
The fuck you doing? Bullshitting

I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm looking in the mirror
By the time y'all over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time you riding what I'm riding on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flier miles is in the thousies I'm outtie
Somewhere chilling in Maui, swimming with the scuba fishes
The fuck you doing? Bullshitting

Nigga I be splargin, I beg my pardon
Cause y'all niggas is starving looking for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yea I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be running through them trees niggas call me Tarzan
What you think? We won't stop! Gone stop? Silly ho
I'm living out my dreams, don't you dare hit that alarm clock
I'm laid up with your girlfriend You knocking like what u doing nigga?
The fuck you doing? Bullshitting

I hit you with an AMC, my nigga that's a full clip
And you could be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit



Oh yeah you guessed it
Finally Famous in this thing we finessin'
Cartier lenses on me, ain't no questions
In and out of town I ain't slept in
Weeks, you ready?
Look, I've been in and out of town
Still making plays even when I'm out of bounds
Automatic champagne popping never out of rounds
Tell me where the throne, that's where I be sitting down
I run up in your city, run the spot, run the town
Even run that motherfucker when I'm not around
Only time to fuck, not to fuck around
I got weed, bad bitches, and money and they all 100 pounds
God damn, I am, from pots/pans
Turn that shit straight to hot sand
Yeah I got the blueprint these niggas try and trace
They tell me slow down but I'm in the human race
And I be damned if I ain't first, never living in reverse
I just hit it from reverse, swear that shit so crazy
Man L.A. girls so crazy
How's it sunny if them hoes stay shady
And New York bitches screaming "Fuck you pay me."
In ATL they be eating all the gravy
In Detroit man those girls so gangster
In Philly I've seen some pretty faces
Look, I love it when she up and down the pole
Make me want to take your ass up and down the coast
Have you ever been Annapol where they champagne sipped
Then fly across the border to the 416
Then go up to Philly where they know that shit legit
One time for the hood man you know that we the shit
Come through in the city and you know I eat Philly
And you know I'm repping Philly man shoutout to Meek Milly
I be going in this bitch until I'm silly

Dreamchasers what up though?
It's that finally famous boy
You know we out here repping since day one
Look, I got a lot on my mind

If I ain't going to get it
That day is going to waste
I'm trying to move in my safe
Like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the steakout
Oh you know it's official when I go bringing that Bape out
I'm looking through the magazines like this the girl I'm about to take out
One time for Detroit, yeah you know that's what stay out
Yeah you know plotting up in there to find a way way out
Find a way way out we had to fire way way out
Music been bumping man we just waiting to break out
This the player you've heard of
The young and assertive
I came from the dirt up and
Did the unheard of
Hoes say I'm the man, uh-huh I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment, what the fuck is the purpose?
No calling my phone unless you the fam or my girl I'll just say it's no service
Stay connected as cursive

Live life, get high, change the world
Man do it all before you go
In Europe riding Europeans so it's not a foreign O
They like show me the moves, no time for a tutorial
They're is levels to the game, like who put this shit on story mode?
His story historical
Mr. Anderson, I know Sway ain't got the answers so I'm looking for the oracle
All my favorite rappers told me life's a bitch
So I'mma fuck the world through the glory hole
So that bitch can't take me to the Maury show
If she don't smoke weed, pop pills, suck *Tss*
If it's one thing that I hate, man it's boring hoes
All my girls love me
So if I die today it be like 5,011 something freaks at the memorial
Lil bitch
I hop up on the beat like it's the 08 me
When we was riding for D boy no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now it's courtside at OKC

And all these singer girls know me like do-re-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but doe come first
No late fees
Kool-Aid smile, colgate teeth
The bigger that I get the more I need shrinks
Woop-woop got a couple screws loose
You was in the winner circle you just trying to get off in the fruit
Fruit Loop
Turn nothing into 2, something into new
I could write a best seller out of alphabet soup

Try me, try me
I'mma get this whole motherfucking family
Looking I ain't playing with nobody
I come from 6 mile boy I ain't a Cosby
Understand I came up nigga yeah that's all me
The world is in my palm motherfucker I need palm trees



As I hop on this red eye flight with all red eyes
Hoodie over my head, recognize a Jedi
If I go too fast down this road I end up like Left Eye
I’m wondering would it be better if I left life
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I’m gonna find hoes
Sneaking in my iPhone, looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her what she crying for
I’m so fresh I’m wondering "why didn’t I design clothes?"
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Meetings at the label saying they gon' make Sean blow
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean? No
Man please do not gimmick me, put me on the shelf and not remember me
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they tonsils
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
It’s clear now, I'mma focus on my career now
You taught me to create a process
Saying that you changed my life dog it’s me being modest
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour
Put you in the studio so you could focus more on my shit
And I don’t mean to sound selfish
But I am not an artist that's selfless
I’m feeling like a crab in a bucket
That’s just tryna get it crackin'
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish

And it’s a dream come true that you signed me
Big Sean, G.O.O.D. Music signee
People asking me how it happened, man I tell 'em
I Rolex-ed the situation and just had perfect timing
And you already know where to find me
Bitch I'm connected to the D like Siamese
So if you see me out of town getting money
Know I do it for my city and I be back very promptly
So say what up if you see us
And the D is burn rubber and the Sean man lead us
Like being undefeated, feeling undefeated
Dick so big I bust a nut for a fetus
Glad to do any interview or dope feature
Come holla at a nigga as I’m trying on sneakers
Niggas making diss records in efforts that I see it
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it
You are not half of what I am and can’t be it
You are just a hundred-and-one percent bitch
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance
And I don’t want fans, I want believers
Race to success so I'mma keep pedalin'
Cuz my mamara man she deserve everything
So if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her
Then best believe she gon' get a wedding ring
But I don’t know if I believe in love to be honest
Cuz every girl love the headliners
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there
And best believe they gon' give us all a hair line-up
And that’s why girls wanna leave us
Tell 'em where we are but they never gon' believe us
Won’t stop till we end up on that show Cheaters
But I bet you couldn’t spot me if a nigga wore cheetah
And I be in the strip-club Teasers
Giving all the girls what’s needed
Honest dog had so many problems dog
I could hand 'em out and be labeled a fuckin' teacher
So respect my hand gesture
I dare any nigga try and come test us
You a mothafuckin' act dog, a A.C.T. that’s why niggas try and test ya
A-Dub how the hell we gon' make a mil
Pay the bills man, I ain’t tryna waste a deal
If you could make a deal believe you could break a deal
And if you can’t keep your promises then don’t say you will
Nigga don't say you will



Shit, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
They told me a nigga wouldn't amount to shit
Nigga, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
But you don't know nothin' about that, shit

Yellin', whose house is this? Huh
Bitch, Do I even gotta ask now?
Who the fuck are you? Do you even got you a pass?
I don't know why you cuffin' yo girl, she ain't even got her no ass
Middle fingers to all of the nonbelievers
Not only did I beat the odds, I also got even
Took a spot up on the throne, I see myself see myself
Said it twice cause history repeats itself 'peats itself
Man I can't even lie, I be high I be high
Mother fuck drinkin' and drivin', I'd rather get high and fly
I'm out of here, like outer wear
We are not the same, you are not a player
My house is somewhere off in the woods, girls in my bed like I'm papa bear
They say hard work pays off, wrong it pays good as hell
You the man huh? Sorry I couldn't tell
Claimin' that they BIG, well I really can't lie
From the top they all look the same size


I start my mornin' with the paper
Bitch I'm rich free press, hundreds on all the pages
And you can't slow me down, I'm sorry there's no delay
Me and my committee run the city, you just tryin' to join the relay
Leader of the new school, reportin' from the PA
These niggas call me cuz but I don't know why, cause we can't relate
I got yo sister doin' thangs on camera I can't replay
But she's a waste of time, fuck I could've had a V8
I turn thousands to milli's, it's time to renovate the ceiling
I'm turning houses to buildings, hustle while you out here chilling
What's the wordy I'm certainly getting rich in a hurry
I swear I fuck 'til I'm tired, I'm getting high 'til it's blurry
I'm from the dirty glove, where hammers turn crews into jurys
They'll make you sit down, but as long as you with me ain't no worries
Man I'm puttin' on for my crew, never for these hoes
I'm puttin' on for my city, she puttin' on her clothes




I feel good
I feel wonderful
And it's because
You made it that way
I feel super spectacular because of you

And now I'm flying
I think I'm floating
I feel so high
Your love leads me to the sky
And if I fall I won't care
Cause I'm safe with you

And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
Cause I'm in love with you

Now baby you the truth so I'm just being honest
You treat me like a king so that's why you my highness
That means queen
Seems I known you for the longest
And I know it ain't as deep as it could be
Or as it would be but that's how it should be
Cause overtime we gonna be fine like wine
I never put another over mine
See difference between you and them is they just wanna shine and
Well you
You just want Sean
So tell mama sandy, mama myra and that family
That when I get that grammy, they gon' be a granny
And if I see that reaper before you see that reaper
Beaker

So promise that you'll keep me
Promise you won't lead astray
You promise me forever you promise me to stay
So I keep you with my laughter
We're so complete

There's something bout your brown eyes that gets me lost for days
Your touch is like an angel lookin' down with heavens grace
And that's why I'll keep you sheltered from the storm
I need you here with me

And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' I won't stand in your way

Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
Bitch, you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homies
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short change
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag

Hol' up everybody, don't worry, man, I got it, I got it

Boy, the sword just got sharper, nigga
This ain't war, we just sparring, nigga
I was on the rooftop with my nigga Mike Carson, nigga

I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches rant and rave
I hope I never have to go back watching
Everybody Loves Raymond
Eating ramen, nigga, this paradise
Life's a fucking paradox and pair of dice
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites nigga
I had that vision, it was ClearSight, nigga, Sean Don



I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Man that shit you talking raising my sodium
When I step to the podium
Like they bringing the trophy in
They like "Aww, there he go again"
I do what I got to do to ride up in that European
I knew back when I was playing Little League down at Bobian
That, that boy had that glow like he ran off with plutonium
Back when I had a crush on every girl on Nickelodeon
Man I knew I had to be in and out of Fallopian
Bank accounts at Wachovia
I can't be no custodian
Just imagine how the drama felt
Imagine how my momma felt
Swimming in the debt boy I was hungrier than ever
Ya this must be how piranhas felt
I had to put my G-Shock back on just to go remind myself
When we needed all kind of help
Back when we was all alone on our own
Now they on my phone brrrr Sean Don Corleone
Fuck every OG who passed up on my and put me on a song
Except for Ye so I'm forever repping foot up on the throne
You was popping back when I was wearing pow chains
Now you back at home, how mane?
Whole squad come together killing shit like the Power Rangers
I stay in tune and out of danger
Lady on the way Mercedes on the way
Album on the way
Rapping like I got a baby on the way
I'm like Baby with the pay
Pay me when? Today
Bitch it’s do or die, seven days a week and holidays
Ho ass bitch

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Hammer in and out of court, nigga don't get trialled up

I'm ripping clothes off
Car's so big

Muh-fucka might rip them toes off
I said B-I-G, I'm that important
You spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking, what
Ridin' low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to -uck it up now
Texts from my mom say
Me and your Grandma proud
Came way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me
Get a job, save up for 401k
I'd rather be young as hell counting 401k
I'ma probably die gettin' some head
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs
What
But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch I better get the debit if I don't get the cred
That I deserve
Yo, I say
From the Westside
I look like pocka
Where they pop your block up
A block up
Big Poppa
Flock off
You holy little woahdy holy Kenobi, Chewbacca

Regret it like half the -oes I smashed in the sheets

Y'all gotta go get the album
That's just a couple bars
Big Sean in the building, oh man



Trying to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I can think about is our last fight
I was gonna play it on piano
Had the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballad strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sang
Piece of paper that I started with got thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you're just
A lame who's shit out of luck
I almost wrote you a love song

She threw my watch out the window
Chain in her hand
She running through the crib
Finding anything she can
Our relationship is not the only thing that's out of hand
She even called my momma like
'you need to get your man
Cause your son lying on me
I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club trying to find a man'
Bitch you headed to the club trying to find a man?
What is you saying?
Hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagined in white gowns
So with your left hand you should let me add a ring to it
Since mr and mrs anderson just has a ring to it
She like 'why you act like that to me?
Then walk right back, mike jack to me?
Everytime we fall out I throw your ass out'
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me


I think you crazy, crazy
You need medication
You should calm down
You need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations
About how I'm wrong without any explanation at a ll
Before you say another nigga next up
I should call the maid down cause I messed up
I gave you what you need
Even on those shopping sprees
She said 'what if we reverse roles
And you was front row cheering at my first show
And a couple dollars later and some Louis vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinkin that you said I know
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought id never do it, it even hurt more
And I would lie about it but you found out from a source
Whos word was more truthful than yours'

I'm so glad I didn't ever pen it
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would've did it I probably would've stay with you
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling
You did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I gotta new guy that's turning me on
And the big ballad strings about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote about to get sang
A song about his love is gonna see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

That came to check you

Hit once and it was new sheets time


Mami I realize that I'm mannish
Speak a language of love like Spanish
"Quero Fugir"
I'm so obscene and know what I mean?
Yeah sorry that was Portuguese
And I speak with ease

It was all good just a week ago
Worst problem that I had was that my speakers blown
In my whip, fuck it I got me a job
I feel rich I ain't gotta sell weed I'm legit
Shit I seen her pull up in a parking lot first
Thought I had was hotties, hoes didn't find where I work
Then her friend, "Hey go girl go tell 'em"
I knew she was mad as hell when that bitch said, "Tell em'"
All because I hit and stop textin'


She like I ain't try to argue with it, I know you got bitches
I just hit you back because I'm moving forward with this shit
Really my mom and my aunt was my father figures
I just figured with fathers it might make all the difference
I'm sayin', "Is it mine? Do we gotta get Maury involved with it?"
"How many niggas you think that I done had all in it? Stupid nigga"
I don't even know why I'm sayin shit
I hate to be on that all-nigga's-the-same shit
But shit I'm saying girl it is what it is
We talking kids with a kid and a crib with a crib
But I ain't tryin' to leave believe
I would be a good dad just like my dad was to me
And I can't tell you to kill that shit my mom had me
And I can't tell you to keep a shit we ain't ready
Now I gotta tell my family to pull up a seat
Cause I planted a seed and about to extend the family tree
And we so stressed out that I called a weed man
Cause I prolly gotta bout a whole family tree


Granny called my mom sayin' I have demons
I heard my parents talkin' in the next bed
What the hell they teachin' these kids in sex ed?)
Everything that I forgot while getting the best head
I know couples who took classes cause they couldn't
I know ball players who pay strippers so they wouldn't
What really make me feel like I ain't shit
Is that I still gotta tell my main chick


Fuck, there go our little secret
She gon' have it
She gon' keep it
9 months later shit we gon' see it
Damn, aww shit



Ok I think I think I think I think I'm the baddest
We got all the bottles they got all the glasses
I'm prolly with yo girlfriends cause they got all the asses
Burning all this paper you should try and catch the ashes
I'm in my section poppin something off
In the bank or a bitch droppin something off
Wo-wo-work ho make me throw this paper out looking like a paper route
Dick her down lay her out didn't have to take her out
Thinkin I'm a do her right look left and fake her out, haaa
Cause I get back to the money
If I ever leave boomerang back to the money

All I think about is money and sex fuckin and checks
In this life time you need to run and get left
M m money and sex fuckin and checks
In this life time you need to run and get left
Now I'm finnaly gettin rich proly in ya bitch
And if I there I'm proly getting rich cause all I
Of is money and sex fuckin and checks
Money and sex fuckin and checks

I say I feel I feel I feel I feel I'm the best
Got the game on bubble like the vest, piece hangin on my
Chain chain hangin on my chest chest
The game is on lock money power and respect
I started in the streets choppin rocks in a gravel pit
Went from not having to having it
From dreaming to grabing it
With only top ramen noodles up in my cabinet
Now I'm killing this motherfucker, beating and stabbing it
Speaking of stabbing it where ya bitch she just text me
She say she in the room rockin something sexy
No disrespect g cause I ain't even trying to but send her to my room if you see her before I do


Bitch I'm on a money making marathon
Welcome to the terror dome
Journey of my life, The whole world is my carry on
I took I vow that I'm forever getting payed
Always heard that lifes a beach so I'm forever getting laid
If money equals power then I'm a fucken generator
Man that spotlight bright
So watch me center stage it and do it
Yo girl wanna do it
Damn I look good
But you already knew it
Can't remember the last time I seen my bed sets
Or the last time I had bed sex
I'm in the backseat
Getting my dick wet
I fell asleep getting brain
That's a head rest



OK, I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not fall
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm an avatar
I pick up a O from, my nigga Ralphy
My bro and me, but he is not alphy
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy, Damn, if you ain't know
I made these girl night, smoke a paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch you getting brain if a nigga not learning
I be spending money if a nigga not earning
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring
And I be rolling up if a nigga not burning, boy

I got five on it
Have your bowl and get beat
I got five on it
Nothing with that endo weed
I got five on it
If you got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Now let's go hop outside

You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed
Why speed, no need, I be just taking it slow
I be so clean, diesel over powers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blazed on shifting this way
Y'all just some white belts, with leaves I am the sensai
Now bow to the bag never, save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack, let's cop a quarter pound now
What the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five


How wired, 6-4 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys, I was high partna'
Fuck you want? This the raw paper not a blunt
You must, got me mixed up with Chip cause, This Spitta
Zig zag a whole zip up, shit strong shoulda' came with a bed pick up
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa'
That weed you smoking brown, fake weed to much make up, clown
Get real smoking green, strawberry fields
High standing up feelin' like I'm layin' down, couple bugie Judy's came round
Actin' all stuck up, now they just stuck from smokin' with us
Had the hallway smellin', Is my windows opening enough?
I hear walkie talkies, Is security coming up?
Fuck




Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

Three percent tint
I can clearly see out
But you can barely see in
The end and on the end
We blowing Indonesia
And I'mma let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy the haze got me hazy I'm lazy
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive



Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter ho

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter ho

Stack that paper
Stack it stack it stack it up some more
Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more

I'm smoking up on that tropical jolly green, yea Galapagos
Rainbow chain and my necklace look like a pot of gold
I'm who these girls is tryna know jumping off Jeronimo
They tell me I'm the best and I ain't even trying ho
See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes
So now I'm in two hoes, real shit boy
You don't drink? more for me
We chillin out where niggas can't afford to be
Look baby girl you better act accordingly
Cause I see bout ten more of you but sorry theres no more of meeeeee


Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can
Cause I might go from plane to whips
Cause money is hand to hand
And I be shining neck to wrist
And your girl want mouth to mouth
And I make her get neck to dick
Cause she just want connections with a nigga that's connected
Bitch, I'm who they want see, want see
Used to tell me everything I won't be
You gon' be, fucking with piranha's and they gon' eat
But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry
Oooh, and now my life is beautiful
I'm a boss bitch you should come and grab a cubicle
Look and I remain until my funeral
Stand up nigga like I'm in front of the urinal




I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not far
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm a Avatar
I pick up a O from my nigga Ralphie
My bro and me, but he is not Alfie
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy
Daaaaamn, if you ain't know
I make these girls nice, smokin' paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch me gettin' brain if a nigga not learnin'
I be spendin' money if a nigga not earnin'
Catch me in the back seat if I'm not stirrin'
And I be rollin' up if a nigga not burnin' boiii

Grab your fo', let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin with that endo weed
It's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got five on it
Patna let's go half on a sack

You know a nigga like to stay at that cruisin' altitude up in the sky
Tried to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
'Cus the shit I blow can be smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans everything you need is in-stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo when you see me blowin' on some weed
Why speed? No need, I be just takin' it slow
I be so clean, diesel overpowers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blaze are shiftin' this way
Ya'll just some white belts with these leaves I am the sensei
Now bow to the bag, never save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack let's cop a quarter pound
Now what the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five


High wired, 64 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys I was high patna
Fuck you want, this a RAW paper not a blunt
You must got me mixed up with Chip 'cus
This Spitta, Zig-Zag a whole zip up
Shit strong, should'a came with a big pick-up
Bitches callin' me wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa
That weed you smokin' brown
Fake weed too much make-up, clowns
Get real smokin' green strawberry fields
High standin' up feelin' like I'm layin' down
Couple bougie Judys came 'round
Actin' all stuck up
Now they just stuck from smokin' with us
How the hallways smellin', is my windows open enough?
I hear walkie talkies is security comin' up? ...Fuck




Motherfuck my opponent, started with a vision and a nigga got on it
Met success and a introduced it to my homies, now every single girl in the room gon want us

Hell yeah I hope they hearing us
Imma want the beef, broccoli, and asparagus
Tell them rich folks they can couple up a chair with us
They can sure brag , but I know they can't embarrass us
Remember when a nigga barely had a pot to piss in, now I'm on my paper
To me that word is non- existent
And he sound like uhhhhhhh
Quit comparing me bitch
Fuck you with a Ron Jeremy dick
Hell yeah I'm apparently pissed, sonnin' niggas
I could give a parenting tip, I'm too good to really care about shit
Cause I'm young with money like I inherited it, biotchh



Get a buzz, champagne and club in the dusk
Wonder on top of the drums before the ambiance
Trying to get the sun involved, reflect on these hoes
No mirrors, my vision is simply through carrera gold
Synopsis flow

Legion of Doom the superheroes have entered the room
Everyone move, everyone move, except for the Betty Boops
I'm Coming for you
Reservation at pussy pool, let's make it for two
Amateur addict get this long dick stamina
IChat the camera
Screw faced and hammer her
Can't touch it if it's funk

If Young Metro don't trust you I'ma shoot you

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the damn job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I’m homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that chick off like an edit
I heard ya new, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time mane

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
How dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything expect worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
They change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Look I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Look I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Yeah fuck what you know
Look I’m takin' back control
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Aaliyah taught me that if first you don’t succeed
To try again and bounce back
The harder you hit the ground
The higher you bounce
Facts, it’s physics
So many problems systematically we call it the system
Drug dealers and drug users, they both get a sentence
Do the time now every job interview cut to two minutes
Even if you overqualified
Living in a cardboard box
They go bounce you right back in it
Got me wondering what politicians do we got politicking
It concern me
Presidential debates is sounding too personal
My bro reached over like
Man damn what happened to Bernie
I guess primaries wasn’t his primary to get it in
Come November lets see if it happen again
I decided that counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
I decided for the first time in my life, no second guessing
I decided in this moment in time right now who the best is
I’m the best



Shit, you want my shoes? You want my shirt? My jewels too, nigga?
Well you need gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

You can't afford the price, so why the hell would you ask it?
These faggots try and snatch it, get they ass in a casket
Ya honey love me, she admire the fashion
And I call her baby girl, just like her dad did
There's 100's on my paper like a smart ass class kid
Because I'm on top my route, like an ad lib
And you should holla mamma, Dolce and Gabbana mamma
Gotta a whole lot o' mamma, Fendi and the Prada so you need to
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
But to get boy you gotta be rich or something
And my attire hard, hard like my dick or something
I made more then ends meat
My nigga BIG told me he was bout the Benji's
I'm in the lime light 'til the point my skin green
And living my dreams 'til the point you should pinch me to convince me

Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

If I told you where to get it, you niggas still wouldn't grab it
Just to pronounce it, you gotta add an accent
And they ask, can they call me grocery store?
Cause my pockets full of paper and plastic
Man, you not avoiding my Asian persuasion
Excuse the lil Ape in ya face, it stays Bathing
And when the heat blaze on high beams
You scream, I scream
For some cold ass ice cream
You need to gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Pose for the hoes, they might wanna take a pic or something
Hop up in the ride, they might wanna let me stick or something
There's some things, I don't like, I love them Nike's
But not the white on white's, forget the price tags
Cause I get what I like, and your girl looking for me
Because she like the pipe, ya dig?

Now its gon be a problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr. Christohper Wallace

Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Shoulda said it

Never slowing down that's why I'm gettin' paid fast-forward
Smokin' medical, sippin' chemical I need a labcoat
From where they livin' off food stamps that's past poor
Thought about it as I got a stamp in my passport
Yeah I made it out, made it up, and I'll remain makin' it up
Never satisfied what I make, no such thing as makin' enough
Bitch I'm livin' like its monopoly
Tryna dodge jail and I'm buyin' up the property
Yo wifey was down with monogamy, til' she started massagin' me
But you can't have a dollar ho, blame it on the economy
A young player at the tip-top
Bitch niggas hatin', bad bitches wanna liplock
I could show you the ropes, since I got the game in a slipknot
From a city of G's I'm just the one that was picked out

Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper paper paper paper
Ya might pass out and die if ya try and match my labor labor labor labor
Bitch I'm tryna build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper scraper scraper stackin' my paper

See I got so many shows, think it's a season of Lost
Get money uniform, you can see I'm on my job
Ah damn, bitch you better stand in your lane
All my jams are so insane, you just Danity Kane
Straight pussy, and no balls
Rockin' jeans and thug sandals, that's a faux pas
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve
They evolve into a Gotti, was illa then you thought you was
Now we in Bugattis ridin' shotty when we shoppin' for some good shit
I don't claim no hood shit
But I guarantee you I ain't on that Hollywood shit
Hey, unless it's chilling up at Holiday Hills

Say Say Say

Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper paper paper paper
Ya might pass out and die if ya try and match my labor labor labor labor
Bitch I'm tryna build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper scraper scraper stackin' my paper



On the come up
On the come up
Sun up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up
Come up
Gun up
All my young niggas on the come up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up

All my niggas live Italian
Eating spaghetti and salad
Last night, she just fucked a stallion
Inside of a palace
All my niggas live Italian
Loyalty is all I'm askin'
My whole squad run the atlas
Look, I feel like I was chose to the take
Care of the ones I'm close to
Kitchen looking like whole foods
Got the fam around like it's soul food
Damn, I do this shit for the set
Working all year till we set
Quick to check a bitch, yeah, I check her even though life's a game of chess
Cause I'm living play by play, day by day
No time for her honestly
And her face looking like a young shawty
Cause I gotta get it a hundred ways
But you know 'bout being down and out...



Man I wish that I could kill her
I wish that I could still feel her
Now I'm at the club lookin for a feel up
Bartender make sure my drink stays filled up
Man look at this mess I'm in
In my darkest hour I can't see the horizons
But I still remember her sizes
Thirty-four, twenty-two, thirty-five it, and
And I'm the man to these broads
With one glance I could get 'em to minaj
Through all of the screamin and all the applause
I'm Mr. Big Shot, but you was my star
Hey Juliet, I guess our book's done huh
You know I ain't book smart
Cause I just thought it was a bookmark
And we coulda picked up where we left off

There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way


Man I wish that I could shoot her
I wish that I never knew her
Man what I'm sposed to do huh
She my backbone how I'm sposed to manuever
And I know I said it last time
But I swear last time was the last time
But now she say it's all past times
And I feel like I see my flatline
And I'm supposed to be a man and all
But when you get That involved
You gotta start thinkin with ya head
Nah ya real head not the one in your pants and all
Man she was sposed to be my baby
Man we was sposed to see a baby
Man I woulda gave her everything
Better life, wedding ring, everything we never seen


There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way


Man I wish that I could stab her
Remember when I used to grab her
I wish a nigga still had her
It's gon' hurt to see another nigga have her
When I call it's no answerin
She ain't love Big Sean she love Sean Anderson
Man you could probably feel me dyin
And you could probably hear her cryin
She killin me from the inside out
Took everything in the crib that was inside, out
She priceless and I can't afford it
You want space baby and I gave you orbit
So come home, Home is where the heart is
She said whenever I'm here I feel heartless
So it's time to part then
I beg your pardon won't be back tommorow, nah


There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way, Outta your way, Outta your way, Outta your way

Why are you so Paranoid?
Don't be so Paranoid

Aye, Aye
Now baby I can tell you want more cause you put less out
And every time you stepped in I could tell you stepped out
Your girlfriend said I remind her of the rest, yea
But tell yo girlfriend that she remind me of the Press
Just talkin' and talkin'
So maybe we can sneak to the back then
I know you heard about the freaks that was back then
So last week, we so right now
They so hyped up man tell 'em pipe down
And you can tell from the watch and chain
They been in and out my jeans like pocket change
Just be real, man I wouldn't be real
If I ain't have my fair share like the stock exchange
And if today tend from your past relations
Aye yo you either let go or you go lesbo turn around and date them
So maybe we should head to the exit
Cause they caught a case with they ex-es
They mad you'd a leave while a nigga ex-stressed
But we know what it is right?
So we gone let 'em live right?
You know why they call me Big right?
Tell 'em look left while we get right

Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you anyway
They don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights that are long
So now you here with me stressing about it too
Leave that attitude way back at home
Yea you see 'em look dirty
Let 'em give you cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk and the world lost in the world
Can you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed
Baby, Don't worry about it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor


Baby don't worry about it
Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing




Okay I say that shit again, I said it once before
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all
I glist and shine with Miss Fine
Model chick, big behind
Bad enough to skip the line, but to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double O, you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch I am a monster, I belong on District 9
Catch me in my office doin' business
The fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arivin'
Bring out the Rozay and the Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran

Just a million people behind me and I don't have Verizon
Man I'm chillin' wit my niggas, nigga
And a couple cool bitches
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
Me and my niggas, Say It Ain't Tone
Hundred pretty girlies singin' our song
Yeah I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
And I be blowin' on that reefer you can't say that it ain't strong and
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a Conehead
When I'm done go ahead
What the fuck this is?
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm lookin' in the mirror
By the time y'all over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time you ridin' what I'm ridin' on, I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flyer miles is in the thousies I'm outtie
Somewhere chillin' in Maui swimmin' with the scuba fishes
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
Nigga I be splargin
I beg my pardon
Cause y'all niggas is starvin'
Lookin for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yeah I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be runnin' through them trees, niggas call me Tarzan
What you think we won't stop gone stop?
Silly ho I'm living out my dreams don't you dare hit that alarm clock
I'm laid up with yo' girlfriend you knockin' like what you doin' nigga?
I'm like fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

I hit you with a AMC, my nigga that's a full clip
And you could be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit






I do it, I do
True players what we is, man
True players don't dissolve
It's B.I.G. Sean don
Oh God!

Now give me everything I ask for or end up in a cast, ho
Never slow down, that's why I'm getting paid fast forward
Smokin' medical, sippin' chemical I need a lab coat
From where they're livin' on food stamps, that's past poor
Thought about it as I got a stamp in my passport
Yeah I made it out, made it up, Butler remain makin' it up
Never satisfied what I make, no such thing as makin' enough
Bitch I'm livin' like it's Monopoly
Tryin' to dodge jail and I'm buyin' up the property
Wifey was down with monogamy, 'til she started massaging me
But you can't have a dollar ho, blame it on the economy
A young player at the tip-top
Bitch niggas hatin', bad bitches wanna lip-lock
I could show you the ropes since I got the game in a slipknot
From a city of g's, I'm just the one that was picked out

Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper
Paper, paper, paper
You might pass out and die if you try and match my labor
Labor, labor, labor
Man every time they see me they say, "Boy what you doin'?"
"Boy what you doin'?" "Boy-boy what you doin'?"
Bitch I'm tryin' to build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper
Scraper, scraper, stackin' my paper

Bitch, unzip my pants 'fore you try and take 'em off
Open wide, say, "Ahh" then you cough
See I got so many shows, think it's a season of LOST
Get money, uniform, you could see I'm on my job
Aw damn, bitch you better stand in your lane
All my jams are so insane, you're just Danity Kane
Straight pussy and no balls, rockin' jeans and thug
Every time we showin' off
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve
They involved into what Gotti was
Iller than you thought you was
Now we in Bugatis ridin' shotty when we shoppin'
For some good shit, I don't claim no hood shit
But I guarantee you I ain't on that Hollywood shit
Hey, unless it's chillin' up at holiday hills
And rap sixteen bars, all of 'em ill, what

Say, say, say, say







If you trying to come over
I can keep leave the door open
And naw I ain't with the bullshit
So let me know if you fucking, girl
See you been running around my mind for some time
And it's the way I feel, for real

I'm the one the bad broads report to
So every time we leave the club my whole car full
Buncha bitches in the back; carpool
They all wet, so now I'm riding in the car pool
But I could never take 'em where I live
Gotta be my baby if you laying in the crib
But they all get the hotel presidential
But to make it there swear you gotta have potential
Face like a model, waist like a pencil
Treat my dick like an eating utensil
She said, "I'm tryna do what you do"
I told her that I do me
She said, "Well, let me do you"
Plus you know I'm rapping and all
Now we finna cut
I'mma prolly need some alcohol after all
Me and my niggas all up-and-coming
So they gon' try to get us up and cumming
We all running


Yes sir, yes ma'am, had a thousand fall outs and one night stands
And dawg when it come to night stands I done had more night stands than the fucking Art Van
So partin' when she's in my apartment
I'm trying to skip from part two all the way to part ten
She's in my pockets like she tryna get checked or something
And I'm just trying to hit her back like I left some
Smoke some, drink some, lemme spank some
And I don't mean the time when I say threesome
And bet I her make her walk with a limp
Gold 'round my neck like a motherfuckin' champ
Rock Bathing Ape like a motherfuckin' chimp
And bet I cock tail like a motherfuckin' shrimp
So yeah I'mma leave the door open
All night pokin' till my dick broke in, bitch!




Ass Shake, Ass shake
Yeah, I like that ass shake
Ya'll bitches won't show me love
I know ya'll hoes ain't that fake
A real G believe that
Feelin like Outkast
I'm already big now I'm fin to be a ..
She on that superman
Blue and red cop car
Can't sing a lick now she fin to be a pop star
Pop off
And I can't feel shit but my dick in your bitch
So guess what, there's only one thing left to pop off
Feelin like a vegetable with sexy hoes and sexy clothes
They best dressed
Yeah I guess they recognize who they dressin for
She step in the hall to call her man and say she just at home
At my hotel it's valentines all they see is X and O's
And I can't feel my cardio
Motha fuckas walkin in with shrooms
Now I'm fin to feel like Mario
Man I'm livin with these niggas fantasizin life and I'm prayin that I make it through the night
Cause a nigga straight rollin



Straight up
Look
The album droppin', they gettin' nervous
I cancel my Uber, it's time to lift the burden
Know if I take a pay cut that you gon' need a surgeon
I don't want the top spot, I deserve it
All I do is show love and it keep reversin'
Detroit, stand up, you know I'mma lead the resurgence
And prove so much my old shit sound like another person
You know how the story go
Never stuck to the script or storyboard
I just left a four o'clock appointment with the oracle
She told me I got more to go, her boss workin' like I'm fresh off the unemployment though
And I'm celebrating like they told me "You are not the father" live on the Maury Show
It ain't over till a nigga overdose
I heard your new shit and I fell asleep
And wasn't even sleepy, that's how I know it was weak
Look, respect someone who came from the D
Was able to eat, put his friends and fam on and we speak
Who inferred that anyone who skin color this deep
Who still hasn't peaked
Who gets better every verse and word that he speak
Sheesh
Flex let's go
Settin' the tone?
Yeah, we settin' the tone
You lettin' them know what it is?
Yes, sir
I Decided tonight
Look

I know 'Ye proud of me, he took me out of debt
I know Jay proud of me, he put this 'round my neck
And I might just kill ISIS with the same ice pick that I murder Donald Trump in the same night with
Lyrically I'm prepared for the worst
Spiritually I'm prepared for the best
But somehow I ended up in the middle
The exact place where me and destiny met
And I'm still findin' perfection in the imperfections
Tryna go the right way in life's intersection
You're now fuckin' with the most impressive
The most requested, you're witnessing the underdog's interception
And fourth quarter when you thought it was all over
I'm doin' the touchdown dance breakin' they hearts and records
And I probably wrote this shit down there in Austin, Texas
Livin' a life that'll turn my girl to a detective
I'm livin' a life that'll turn my dogs to some executives
I'm livin' a life that'll turn my dreams to some perspectives
Speaking of dreams, I got new dreams and new goals
My new vision is two-oh, by two-oh, that's 2020
Just tryna get that old money, young and find a loophole
So we don't gotta look back like we missed that boat
I got old niggas dissing, ex-girls missin'
Tell me, when did life become a game of tic-tac-toe?
I'm celebrating everyday like I got misdiagnosed
With terminal cancer, but it was just that cold
Oh, shit

I keep it anchored for you, rain, sleet or thunderstorm
Loyalty nowadays rare as a unicorn
I dedicate this one to stories that never get told
Ones who been offered the world for they souls but never get sold
Those are million dollar offers but chose another road
'Cause you realize stayin' loyal to you is always worth more
In tune with the universe, like it's angels singing backup, man
Niggas ask me what's my backup plan
I look at 'em and say, "Does God have a backup plan?"
I'm sayin', look, I ain't God but I'm godlike
God don't like ugly, so I must one of the ones God like
'Cause I been at the right place at the wrong time
With the wrong people at the right place but still ended up here on time
Still ended up on time
Look, I guess it's hard not to get spotted when you livin' in the spotlight
I got my clique poppin', but I hardly live that pop life
Mighta popped a popstar, had paparazzi pop lights
But don't get it twisted, I'm in L.A. livin' that Pac life
In New York livin' that Big life
I'm in Detroit livin' that Don life
I left my last bitch and got my mom right
And I'm still carvin', killin' niggas, dearly departed
Workin' the game like a nigga blew in the cartridge
They know my name in Denver like I'm Eric Cartman
I put granny in the crib like I'm her father
All my neighbors went to Yale and Harvard
Captain of the squad forever startin'
Check the highlights, no yellow markers
I'm deadly switchin' Rollies onto ice like I'm cooking Crystal Light
My role model Walter White, my role model Walter White
Man fuck gettin' indicted, boy, riots gettin' incited
The team the tightest, I touch her and she wet beside it
When I get inside it
But honestly, I can't get even too involved
Phone full of numbers, but ain't too many to call
Contacts on contacts, I hate we lost contact
I know I got more exes than a contract
But I wish it was you and me, remember when you were roofin' me
I wish there was one me for you, one for my family, I mean a group of me's
Goddamn, had to take a breather
Shit, can you believe it
Hold up, I ain't done my nigga
Need another?
No, hold up

Ha ha ha, yeah of course we here
Where else would we be at?
Okay, let's go

Okay
Shout out my nigga Esco
Yeah
Look, real ones
Look, all I ever did was figure it out
Back when a nigga used to have to live on the couch
And had to brainstorm this shit just to get through the drought
I strategized it in my head and started livin' it out
Man, these niggas want to purse what I do on the work
Drag my name through the mud without doing the dirt
I put your face on the shirt like I'm doin' your merch
You love to talk, I'm 'bout doin' it first
Look, I see no change, you can keep the refund
And all the reruns, I seen it all before
Man, I haven't been satisfied in a row
That's one time, two times, three times
From where there's more pieces than piece signs
And gang signs and street signs
Hard times, but you pay your fee to be a phenom
I pull up in a car so busted that I'm hidin' in it
Don't want that Kia even if LeBron is ridin' in it
Psh, I'm offended
Knowing soon as he leave that commercial he pullin' off in that Bentley
Feelin' like the ninth inning, got a home run hittin'
Stone cold spit it, I'm too in tune to be inconsistent
And I done been through the ups and downs
And stay down and waited for ups to come around
You woulda thought we robbed a bank how I'm tryna run the town
And how cops hunt us down as our time runnin' out
I pray that karma doesn't get confused with
Somebody who didn't put the hours and work in and who's useless
'Cause I'm God's MC, like Jesus produced it
It's time to make it work and not make excuses
What are you sayin', my man?
Askin' me about my own
What you tryna do what I do, boy, what, you want be my clone?
You ain't been through what I been through, you can't put that in songs
What you tryna prove me wrong like the banks that put mom on loans
You better watch up your tone, like you talk on the phone
Damn, look
I'm tryna take the greatest story never told and make it my own

Flex
I Decided out right now in this motherfucker
Man, I ain't slept in two-three days
I'm on beast mode
Whatever niggas say about me, fuck what you sayin' if it ain't love
All I do is live my life and love, show love
That's what you supposed to do
That's the way that Jesus do it
If you hatin' on me, fuck you
You know what I'm sayin'?
Flex in the buildin'
G.O.O.D. Music all day
Detroit all day
You see the chains?



Now I'm gon' make a million and one dollars and do it again
Just wait 'til tomorrow, we won't borrow ever again
I can't wait 'til the day we wake up, wake up, wake up
And we all gon' be paid up, paid up, paid up, just wait, wait

Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
When I was supposed to be asleep
I was in the studio like "Y'all, make some beats"
Man you can ask B Right, you can ask Earl Mac
You can ask Pat Piff
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Wanna do a fight club, nigga call me Brad Pitt
Tryna get the whole world to know Sean
I'm the only thing getting better with time besides wine
So somebody gotta find me
Cause Sean be cranking hits like Bons B
Man I swear GOOD Music wanna sign me
Yeah right B, naw for real nigga


Man, I can't give you all that man
Right now I wanna get into an exclusive produced by my dawg 88 Keys
Man, featuring Mr Bentley

--------------------------------------------
*Finally Famous 2*
Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
But there always was girls on my penile
And I fell victim to the vaginal
But when it comes to the ass chase
No thank you, rather run in the cash race
'Till the world knows Sean
The only thing getter better in time besides wine
Honestly better than all these asses
With no practice, for real just as is
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz
So I can say I have it, iff not I wish I had it
I do it with a passion


And we just started, we ain't nowhere near the outro
I'll tell y'all what I'm about though
High ends, high spendin'
We just tryin' to end life on a high note, Soprano
And I was supposed to be on for a minute
Man I've been writin' songs for a minute
And you can ask Kanye, you can ask G-Ro, you can ask Don C
Hip-hop where the hell you find a nigga like me
Snotty nose lil' nigga, used to tear up ice cream
Now I'm wearin' Ice Cream with a chain on my shirt
Call that bitch an Ice-T
So tell me what it takes to go from sittin' on porches
To sittin' in Porsches, take in less fortunate
And turn it into a fortune
And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion


I'm gone make a million, just wait 'till tomorrow, I'm gone make a million
Do it again, we gone do it again, do it again




"Patience is not simply the ability to wait
It's how we behave while we're waiting."


Patience
Patience is the ability to accept trouble, suffering, delay
Without getting angry or upset
I feel like if you could master patience, you could master anything
To sit and plan out your goals & dreams, strategize
Understand how the universe works
How things manifest
The time it takes is part of your own learning process
It's hard to realize this when things aren't coming fast enough
Whether it's a check, a job, a loan, a dream, a goal -
It all takes patience



To be in L.A., to look out that window and see that view

Always remember, with the proper attention, from the highest place
The purest place, the highest vibration, you'll always get what you want
There's no point in rushing
If you rush too much, you might not get where you going
Usually when you rushing, you stressing
It can effect the quality of any and everything you doing
You might have a thousand strikes before you hit a homerun
To see the bottom means that the top is just as real
And just as obtainable
I realize patience is key for happiness
It allows you to be happier
To always see the bigger picture in everything
I feel like wisdom is priceless
And patience is a major part of that
There are certain things you can control
Some you can't
When you approach a situation with patience
You bring your best self to that situation
Giving yourself the best chance at success
At whatever is at hand
I learn there are lessons in patience
It could teach us a lot of things
I could give you a hundred stories
About how I wish I could go back in time to talk to myself -
Tell me to calm down, relax, don't let this throw you off
When I graduated highschool I decided to focus on music
It was one of the hardest things to watch all my homies at school
Especially the schools I could have went to
I felt like everyone around me was progressing
And I was at a standstill
Man I was doing a lot of reading
I realize you have to recognize your own process
And it can't be measured by anything but happiness
Just remember your journey is the most important part of the story
Not the trophy
The time I spent frustrated, depressed
Afraid of what might happen or not happen
Was the worst things I ever went through
Worst feelings I ever felt
I didn't get anywhere thinking, feeling like that
It was when I came out of that way of thinking that it all started turning around
I realized that a man who masters patience is a master of everything else
To make it to the top of your game
It takes patience



Ay, Big!
They say they want something real
Thats what I’mma give em
And if I keep it real how could they not feel it

Hey yeah
Can you say GOOD music?
Can you say GOOD music?

Let me tell you about a bad ass chick
Everybody wanna grab her
Tryna climb on that looking for a ladder
Niggas wanna stab her, dag her, dag it
Everybody want it
Ain't too many had it
Beauty and brains, went to all the classes
Graduated too even went and got a masters
Bad ass chick probably could have been an actress
So what she do?
She want to be an actress
Moved to Manhatton, shit got real
Took acting classes with Denzel
Leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills

Commercial money baby, ten thousand and a mill
Yeah, plus she had a baby boy
And the nigga she was with she couldn’t love more
Still want more, shit, she on a roll
Move to Hollywood, she could probably get a role
And she did, but realised the nigga wasn’t shit
Addicted to the broads and on top of this she pregnant
With another boy
Honestly thought abort but still had the boy
Lets name him Sean
Honestly probably after Connery
One of her favourite actors but acting ain't promising
Ay yo I know there was certain things that was meant for you
And thats why I’m giving you

This whatever you want
Just tell me
You deserve whatever you want
I won’t stop till you get whatever you want
All the lights
For your baby boy
Hold on, I'm on my way



That into it, spitta so intricate
If they ain't feeling him they get the boot like Timberland
They still hating, I reboot 'em like computers
And let them know that your boy on the ball no hooping
But from downtown like a three-point shooter
To uptown they feel a nigga deeper than masseuses
The truth is I does this, spitting like I was toothless
Coming to you clearer than blueprints, I move in
They sleeping on me man and I ain't sheets
Bloodsuckers so I'm calling 'em leech
I gotta eat and I'm hungry like I skipped breakfast, where's the ketchup?
I'm tryna cop the Benz or Lexus for winter time
So I ain't gotta go head up to Enterprise
Just to get my ass up in a ride
But nigga's can’t see me like they born with tinted eyes?
To me you little so to see you I got squinted eyes
And I'm just tryna show all of y’all I'm a soulful dude
Compared to me you got about as much sole as shoes
And soul is food, to prove this ask your chick
She all on my dick cause I push it like a pool stick
Who is this you’re asking?
He’s cold as Alaskans, I'm on point like assassins
Y’all as common as Jasmines and Ashleys
And if you ask me you’re never gonna pass me, sheesh, I’m good

Yeah, you really wanna talk about good I'm good
You r-really wanna talk about good I'm good
Just a nigga out the hood
With dreams of being, dreams of being, dreams of being rich

At a instant, fresh out the trenches
Putting competitive nigga's back on they benches
I make that money my apprentice
Cause it lift me up like benching
Your baby girl wanna trap me like a prison but I can see through her like prisms
After I'm hitting I'm dipping, banana split 'n gone
And I'mma throw it to you harder than a quarterback
Working with a dime I'm just tryna get a quarter back
Whipping up that crack music, you should order that
Every 16 is a quarter that you need to hit
Well that's cool, I'm the number one pusher
If a nigga want heat I'm the number one cooker
If a nigga want beef I'm the number one butcher
I-I-I wrap around that green like a Swisher
My intention of ends getting is hella high
And y'all ain't getting your groove back like Stella di'




Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I’ve been dreaming ’bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world

If I ruled the world..

If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I’m addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I’m addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hard top
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up, Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise
So my dog can quit wearing a 44 up on his waist like it’s his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not
Who was just trying to do it Big, but wasn’t Ready to Die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive


Is this a dream, well that’s how it feels
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it’s real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I’m a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet the young Dennis, the menace of society
Check my sobriety fuck hoes in varities
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I’m getting doe man these flows ‘gon retire me
Style on Nadal, I’ve been serving ya’ll lately
Cheddar on Federer
Ball ’till I fall, et cetera, et cetera


Grey walley black stitchin on a train same slang plain Jane
The strial is crispy
24 Karats gazelles clear..
Im so fly real year
Price so la fill weary
Besides killin gear
Its sniffin plain white lines
But jumpin off phenomenal missions
Yep drugs sellers that was in '88
Learnt how to true
Shoot through my coolers
Escape my Uncle huskie karate nigga
Die who stayed in jail
He did a twenty piece
He came home, block movers still know who he is
To us we was kids he said get rich and love life
Dont fuck with no pigs yo
Those days are hazed
Now we in chronic mode
No more plays
Runnin up a rob a clothes home or what
All we had was us and its sucks
Fly niggas is broke
Smoke coke, weed, and dust
I changed for the better
Brand new Beretta
Slappin a nigga face at the steal give me your leather
Through it all I learnt a lot
Plus I burnt a lot
The chronic now returned the clock







Sometimes my mind wanders away from me
I know
I light my dutchy up puff maybe one day I'll fly

I wish that I could be what I want to
I wish that I would do what I don't do
I need a miracle; I hope it come through
Cause I don' 'bout had me enough of not havin' enough, slackin' and stuff
Mama on the phone not braggin' or nothin'
Cause her son ain't really got shit happenin' much
Saw my bank account like where is all the "O's" at?
Hit the club like where is all the hoes at?
Get a little change you gonna see how shit change
You gon' be up in the crib like where is all her clothes at?
And ask your girl she know it easy to say no to a nigga that's broke
But somebody with dough that got a little more?
Shit...I don't know


And I always had drive
Get's where I'm going if I ain't got a ride
And when they ask, "Do you do what you love?"
I'mma say, "I do" if I ain't got a bride
And I always kept Faith like B.I.G
Tryna do it big until my crib on Cribs
Man my girl ain't got to worry about shit
Cause our world is going be the shit
So she can tell her mom I'm a keeper
I am a dreamer, I could of been a king, huh
I'mma put my hands together like an applaud
And look upward, like what up Lord
I know if you try to you can turn these gray skies back to sky blue
Was made for the give and go like a drive-thru
Give us opportunity and see what we do with it




Whoa, Oh
Same ol’ me, but everything around me new
Made it to the roof and still stuck to my roots
Livin’ out the dream
Well, it might be a dream to you
But I do everything I dream, so to me it’s déjà vu
See everybody wanna go to big deal from no deal
To make it to the top you still gotta go uphill
Rollin' up J's, to rollin' up here with J
Crazy how my life just went from surreal to so real
Back when rapping, school was a main contemplation
‘Ye took me to the Grammy’s, we had that conversation
Say, “You don’t make it this far doing no kind of waiting”
And a few years later it’ll lead me to my nomination
And that, that, that's worth more than a diploma
Sometimes being your own boss is worth more than promotions
Chillin’ in a spot niggas kill to get inside
Spilt so much liquor on the ground, you’da thought my niggas died
But we inside!



Got goals, got dreams, Im infatuated with nice things
I love money, it might seem
This is my desire want and need

All I do is eat shit and think about success
Cause man,I done have enough stress
But I beat every obstacle they put up
Im back against the wall like a stove so I cook up
I've always been the best at every single thing I took up
So I feel extra bad for the challenges they hooked up
If I ever up in court best believe I plead the fifth and they headed to the club bartender bring a 50
These niggas bitches swear to god they PMS'ing
Im just chillin' with my family, Mr. Peter Griffin
And my girl look better than yours
And Im the only thing lookin better than her
Yeah, and Im just tryin to make a million off recordin'
Psychic read my fortune, said Id be worth a fortune


I learned at a young age you gotta grind for it
We been waitin' all day n night for it
It seems like we've been waiting all our life for it
Some niggas will take a life for it
But Ima say it I did it all legitamate
Then put my niggas on it just to say I was considerate
Race to success and Im like where the competition went?
The musics runnin' bitch and it never tore a ligament
Niggas comin up to me like Sean I beg your pardon
B-I-G, but how much is you chargin?
Runnin' up to me for they buzz like a barber
And all that weak shit just make mine sound harder
And Ima live this life till Im gone
Only people that could give you life is a judge and God
But the only one that judge me is my God
So Ima live life like fuck what you thought


This is what I live for
This is what I die for
This is what I stayed up every single night for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I live for
This is what I die for
This is what I stayed up every single night for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I waited my whole life for




Alright, c'mon
T-To me, girl, oh it's you

No matter what they say you do you know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you
And when the kids get big they gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you

Now it's a lot on my back like J-Lo
Heaven on Earth, all I'm missing is a halo
Won't stop 'til I am the greatest on my label
When I'm all GOOD music, that's the greatest of the labels
It's hard tryna build a palace out of legos
19 got it in early like eggos
Never did anything illegal for a payroll
So without Cain I was always Abel, get it?
You dumb with it if you ain't able
And life is better with bread like mayo
So I was young like "How we gon' get paid bro?"
Now I'm on rodeo, fresher than a day old, you know
And I know the whole world is gon' see me
Mamma do I look better on TV?
I know them haters irritated as a STD
Man tell them niggas be easy, man be easy


Man I be better, than whoever, for forever in a year
I put it on my ma dear
I love the limelight shine bright, ha bing
19 living out a niggas pipe dream
I'm so legitimate
It would be ignorant
If you were not to consider this, from a true lyricist
Unless they hating on a nigga like Jena 6



Full lyrics will be available upon release
With my best friend
Seven-'leven
We go legend
We go legend
We go legend
We go legend
We go legend
We go legend, yeah
With my best friend
Seven-'leven, yeah
We go legend
We go legend, yeah
We go legend
We go legend
We go legend
We go legend, yeah
With my best friend
Seven 'leven
We go legend
We go legend
Microphone legend
We go legend, yeah

In my house
Yeah, alarms
Got 'em goin'
But you know it, never run your mouth

I don't want the head unless your mouth is real clean, yeah
I create the energy that they keep stealing, yeah
Microphone legend, yeah
Sean Don Legend
My bro is John Legend, yeah
Skrrt out that Maybach, I'm just fresher than the reverend, yeah
Oh my God, oh my God, you cockblocked
Bitch I sock you out yo' socks, me and all my inner circle
We gon' go legend or not me I got no to other op-tion
I go so hard I might wake up with a concussion
The way I piece this shit together, man, it's...



All night, yeah

Batter up, forget the sign, here come the wind
He swing away, I knuckle up
Been in the clutch, he drive a stick
No not bat, you missed that, I'm not in fifth gear, switch
Six Bent, chopped and screwed
I ain't talking 'bout the beat, I'm talking 'bout my suit
Keep four hand not like bi-fon-du
When I move they telling me they loving my colours
All that talking 'bout the clothes, I'm talking about the under
Huh, ground sonic kings I rap while pimped with a wease
My audemar maid bring me green tea
Tell foreign election girls, I massage her feet
And she love me long time, my woman stay on her knees
Use the head for prayer only, Bible to say thank you
And now you know for sure that I'm not like you
I'm not shallow, watch out, I just signed a tape
You can't catch a fish unless you got the right bait
And though I have a stable with the best milkshakes
The booty pass, formaldehyde
Abstinent like ebony in fashion league, why? We different
You complain that there's not enough metaphors
I complain that there's not enough candy for us
We got different tastes, you get hot when you're not getting enough green
Uh, some more collard greens? I got enough pepper sauce
You hear things and let 'em go over your head
I write 'em down and Google 'em before I go to bed
'Nough said, pays the parallel park, rim brand, let the driver take a day, Big Sean got the big Benz instead
Yeah, and if you got all that, the result tab, points are factual, red

It's on, roll up, post up
Here come the pig seats and pose up
And tell 'em that we going all night
Cause we know what you like
Bentley know what you like
Big Sean know what you like
88 know what you like
So tell 'em that we going all night, alright?

I miss Cherie Amore I see
Won't you come be my Cherie Amore for me?
Oui oui, baby I can make it better for we
She got that baby phat fat, not Kimora Lee
I used to be underground like the pipeline
Now I'm everywhere like Wi-Fi
So long on to a Don Corleone
Who was known to be known off performing his songs
And that's honest, I'm from a place that's so unprotected
Need more than a condom
But now a nigga label mates with Common
So how them haters feel? Shit, no comment
You like Kanye? He cool with Hov
Oh, you don't like Hov? Well I know you like Beyoncé
Ain't looking for a wife but, maybe a fiancé
The man on my team from the D like Chauncey
Billups babe, mhmm, and we could leave
I'm tryna beat like 88 keys
High living like we smoke 88 trees
Hot shit baby, I might radiate heat
Excuse me if I don't come all cordial
I don't mean to put you through this whole ordeal
Baby I'm more real
Coming from a city where the niggas keep it popping like Orville





Yeah, Aye, Aye-o At Night I Can't Sleep,I Toss And Turn
I Get Lost For Words,Its Like I Lost My Nerves
It All Started With My Chick About A Bitch That I Hit
That I Swear Ain't Shit,But She Swear I Ain't Shit
Awww Man Lord Help Her She Can't See What Im Sayin
'Or Hear What I Tell Her
It Feel Like Im Talking To Helen, Keller
I Wish That She Could Understand Me,Like A Shelter
I Called Her Up And Said Im Tired Of Beefin'
Told Her Im Leavin' And That Shes Not Needed
She Said Oh So You Just Done With Us, I Love You Doe
Yeah Well That Makes One Of Us And Hung Up
I Got Tired Of My Living Room Decor
Then Headed To The Liqour Store To Get Liqour
Swishor And A Stickor,And Then Pull A Lift Off
Til I Buzz Like Clipors And Pose Like A Clip Board
I Then Go Somewhere I Had No Business
Er'body Hands Up So It Wasn't The Question
I Started To Dippin' , It Take A Man With A Wooden Cane In The Air
To Reconize A Stick Up
Hell Yeah The Niggas Tried To Hit Me
But Off A Whole Round Swear To God They Just Missed Me
Then The Police Sirens were Roarin
They Took What They Saw Then Went Out The Back Door
Shit I Hoped Off The Floor Tryna See Which Way They Went
Mad Than A Motherfuckin' Bitch
Walked Back In To Make Sure Er'thang Was Cool
Looked On The Floor Saw Blood By The Pool
So I Asked The Clerk Dude Whats The Trouble
No Response but His Face Seemed Puzzled
I Walked Towards The Huddle To The Front Of The Crowd
And Thats When I Saw Myself Strecthed Out
See It Wasn't Til I Say My Own Body
That I Realized Them Pussy Ni***s Shot Me
Man I Couldn't Even Tell My Bitch I Love Her
Man I Couldn't Even Kiss My Mother
Ain't That Some Shit Homie?
My Mind Is Playin' Tricks On Me



Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

L-O-V-E M-O-N-E-Y
Cop the True Religion tee
And threw 300 in the sky
Polo shoes on my feet
And my pants are saggin’
Looking so pretty
You would’ve thought I was a faggot
Watch the hood get it
Cook it like chicken
And I got the combo
And it came with biscuits

Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..


Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Why everything green is good for me?
I'm what these bitch ass niggas couldn’t be
6 miles that’s just the hood in me
Peep my ghetto poetry
Is that a green carpet? Now the whole floor a tree
I swear to God ain't no ho in me
But I'm in hoes
I'm probably in your ho
Aw shit there go a staple
At least you know my bitch centerfold
I belong in the Guinness
From most style I rented
Don’t fuck with these niggas
Im fuckin they misses
Im stacking my money
My money get interest
My interest get business
My business get bitches
B-I-G Bitch, I do it, Boi



I think I’m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window

Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn’t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" The question is, "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window


You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
This one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you



Who ya'll talking to man?
Its Big Sean, ay check it out, check it out Ay
This song is dedicated to all my niggas, who be hittin' mad hoes
Thinking everythings sweet nigga
Better watch out, before something creep up on yo' ass.You know?
D-Town what up?

B.I.G is, se is on this beat-is
Why is they in my shit?
I guess they used to being nosey like Kleenex
Cleanest, as the cleanest
Head-toe to penis, thats why she on my dick
Petiteness but that ass fat
So I grabbed that, and we would kick it like hacky sack
And yup and she was all mine I had the ass cat
Made her my girl and my world might I add that?
And its sad that
The love was real, thats what my hearts feelin'
And even though we split, was no hard feelings
I ran into her though a few months after
At the, corner of Main St. and Fith Ave
Asked her, how she was, hows mama and papa
She said "Aw boy you know that you all that they aska'
'bout and I'm proud you doin' good as a rapper
Its nice to see you off the ground like NASA"
And then we started kickin', and reminescin' bout' times past when I smashed
She said "remember in the rain I giggled when it splashed?"
She came twice, I came last on the grass
So I invited her back to my condo
Pronto to continue this convo, cause I know
If I hit that ass then, shit I could probably hit it again
So, then we back at my place
And it was no time wasted, she was in my face
But when I reached for that magnum
Shit, that's when she got mad and
Said, "Sean I wanna feel you like I used to baby and not this plastic"
I said "Bitch it ain't like how it had been
I don't know where you had been, I won't end up like Magic
I promised Mama I would never end up like Magic
And I dont care how good that ass is
And since I wanted to dick her out
It just hurt much more after I kicked her out, damn
I need a model chick, where's Tyra
Or maybe Eva, she fina'
But then my nigga Tone hit me on the phone
Like "Dawg pray to God you didn't bone yo' bro
I was talking to that chick I hit, You know Symone
But I guess she ain't know you was my nigga
To make a long story short
Last week on the 4th, they both got tested
Got the results, she tested positive for genital warts
And, for all them times you made her life depressin'
Grab the weed, grab the cell
Call up my niggas, got a story to tell




Uh Man verse by verse
I'mma make these weak niggas disperse
Man I swear verse by verse
I'mma make these weak rappers disperse
Man I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
Watch me get 'em
I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
Watch me get 'em
I'mma get 'em

I'm very instrumental, to any instrumental
You ain't on my level my nigga, even a little
You at the bottom, not even at Malcolm in the middle
Now hop up on the rainbow try to reach where I hang though
I'm a little further up then and near the angels
So at your highest point you still wouldn't reach my ankles
And the people show love like a bear hug
I'm here to last, they temporary call em' haircuts
Fair enough I stand behind my balls like a felon does
If you a boss, meet the executor and when it come to paper, meet the editor
A little better brah you need to step, step it up
I'm on my business that's my forte, you?
You beat around the bush like foreplay
And they anticipating me like a court date
So for the bars Im'a charge like the court say
Then im in the next city like a tour date
There ain't no I in team but it's in I in win
Ain't no "I" in lose but there's an "I" in him
Meaning me meaning moi, so beat the repertoire of the upper echelon
I stand out from the rest like Yao
But ain't gotta play ball to have you cheering
Perform so well I might as well take a bow
Shitting on these niggas' like a movement from my bowels
People wanna know how if feels in the clouds
But I guess they'll never know cause im never coming down
I started with a dream, added a little faith in
Mixed it with adversity and let it marinate
Call it food for thought, put it on your plate
A friend of mighty Motown, home sweet home
Where I roam like a phone in the unknown zone
My niggas roam like a phone in the unknown zone
And we condone a tone a money hoes and clothes
And my record sell like a boat load
Fam you couldn't fill my shoes like bozos
Coastal, man my nickname postal
Why they local like they old schools
I should beat them like pro tools
Will Farrell nigga started out Oldschool


Note to the world, I made it
I promise I'mma change it
Thank god to my Momma that I'm finally famous



I told my city I'll be back, but for now
I'm leaving, tell em I'm leaving
Promise I'll be back though, at least once a season
Tell em I'mma get it, I'm who they can believe in
I'mma bring it back like I kept all the receipts and
My hood show me love, I'm there to receive it
I know I run my city because I'm there to see it
It's hard being a citizen settling up in Michigan
I'm trying to make a name like a fucking birth certificate
Aww! Now a nigga on
And the DJ playing my song
And she wanna drink a little Dom Perignon
With Sean!

I pray that it ain't temporary
I've seen it in my dreams though
Mr. Visionary and I told them what it is though
Mr. Dictionary - they fuckin regular, I call em
Missionary like

Aww! Can't wait til I get back home
And I'mma put all my niggas on
And we gonna be the ones on TV, everybody
Gonna see me, you'll see man, Aww!
Can't wait til I get back home
And I'mma put all my niggas on

I walk up in this bitch like
Do I need an introduction?
When you living out your dreams
Sleep's an interruption. Man, I made
It out the city of corruption
With no concussion or a toolie tucked in
Yeah, we paid or we laid, no
Minimum wages. Yeah, what else can I say?
We ain't no bed or a lie but we made up
While they was all sleeping and laid up we stayed up
With drapes up like, Aww!
And I'mma be home soon as I get the crown and throne
And the name across it is my own
Who would've known that we'd be paid off
This musical grind. Unusual I, me
And my beautiful mind, that's why my niggas
High-class like a school in the sky. I spit
The heat, you might see a mirage but no facade




G.O.O.D Music in this bitch

Man I was up early in the A.M., legs will be achin'
Feet will be achin' from dreams I was chasin'
Was always told "you won't see nathan just waitin'"
Like them hatin' ass niggas that just sit around hatin'
Pussy ass niggas they shoud sit around thinkin'
Walk around in aprons bitchin' and bakin'
I'm sayin my city like "we need another hero"
I'm tired of playin' the background like Tito
Jackass niggas, remind me of Steve-o
I put em in their place so I remind them of debo
Ay did you see that award show where I got my close
Up? Its all good I got it on Tivo
'Ye called me and my mama said "I think its time to sign"
Got signed 'round the time Common said "its for the people"
I'm tryna make it better for mines without a kilo
Made it out the D, boy and he ain't a d-boy
No, and he ain't a d-boy
Man these other niggas decoys

Now mama I done grown up too much for you to try to have me babied
And lately, I realized that I was needin' a lady
We eatin' bout to have a perfect season I'll be damned
If I get Randy Moss and Tom Brady-ed
I made a little change I can't truly complain
Datin' with a chick that got beauty and brains
But when them bitches come around talkin' bout sex
She gone say that I'm a dog, well all dogs go to heaven
My grandma used to talk about how college was so needed
Signed for a half a mill, now she like "who need a degree?"
At our family gatherings like "who need a CD?"
Everybody hands out like I said "who need a freebie?"
Man what's up? label said "he next up"
People said "he next up" man let's get it pressed up
I'm glad I never listened to y'all and let up
Stuck to my roots, call me Questlove
Call the radio and they gonna request us
So I'm headed to the bank cause I'm finna check up
For real, I'll prolly buy that tomorrow
Naw for real, I'll prolly buy that tomorrow




Now we gon' get it like we should...
And we livin' real good...


Black T, fitted jacket
CD's stackin'
See what's crackin'
Just imagine he ain't packin'
Now it's a joke like he ain't mackin'
If your girl ain't trying to go
GLC remarkably;
Exercise is pimpin tactics
She gave me easy access
But she needs some assets
Her friends informative; I call them "Readers Digest"
All up on the internet
Everything I do and say
Immaculatin' I guess
Having goals, getting close
What's too close for comfort...
It's difficult up in the 'Go
When you got no sponsor...
Trying to get my bankroll...
Beasts have heard me; Monster
Paper stacking up to the ceiling
What a feeling, it's so appealing

Now we gon' get it like we should...
And we livin' real good...
And I bet that my bitch look better than just...
And we gonna be doing this forever
And ever
And ever
Alright...


Now they gonna say that nigga B.I. on top of his B.I.; Business
Got signed like petitions
Committed to commission
Im gonna get it till' my chick got every pair of high heals
All my cribs on high hills...
This is how I feel
On track on top of tracks
You can ask my nigga GL
Hop on tracks with me; fuck around and get derailed
I come from where that cash is more important than the people
If it's prices on your head, then you're gonna get retailed
Come through in the spot...
Bet they give me props
Like a broadway show
Now who them broads waiting for?
Man who the D applaud for?
To keep goin', they pourin', supportin'
And that's why I do it for them
B.I.G



Hold up Sean, roll up some
And let me talk
I didn't crawl to get wet
I am dog, now let me walk, it out
All across every hood
All across the map
All across the global...
And I just need a thick model chick to come home to
Teach her how to work pro tools
Therapy for my vocals
Living good in South Beach
Smoking tree with the locals
Fuck you Mr. Middle Man
I'm so glad I cut you out
Now I'm about to show you what this stunting on them really about
Show you what my city's about
Even though I'm chilling up in the Chi
We just hop on planes and change the time...
So let me set my G Shock
Sean tell them my state of mind




Before I pick up the pace with some shit I'mma say
That's gon' ruffle some feathers but bitch, I can wait
I'm already broke, so what difference it make?
Well to tell you the truth, I don't listen to y'all
Cause the lyrics you spitting, them niggas is fake
I talk about shit that I did and I saw
Cause all of you niggas got bricks in the A
What is this shit now, the Wizard of Oz?
If you ain't no killer, don't get in the car
Trust me, you wouldn't wanna live in the walls
And if they get caught for the million they tossin'
They coming to get every nigga involved
Now you Michael Vick, thinkin' 'bout killing your dog
Told you, you should've just listened to me
And your mama is cool with his Mama?
I told you my nigga, this shit could get deep
You can't murder your foe, but for your freedom
Your heart'll get colder than 30 below
Say if you caught that case when you 20
You wouldn't get out till you 40 years old
Your alibi faded, I heard it before
All of your family is hurting and nervous
And cold that we're back to the verdict to show
That you were found guilty of murking your folk
It's hard to be a street nigga
God put me here to teach niggas
Who never graduated school
But they'll probably catch their first body in the first degree, nigga
Y'all glorified the trap
I don't know what's wrong with these niggas
Cause like Barry White's voice
This shit can get deep, nigga



Cosmic Show, Cosmic Kev
Big Sean in the building
Part 2, right back at it baby

Straight up, Philly what up though?
Detroit

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah you guessed it
Finally Famous in this thing, we finessin'
Cartier lenses on me, ain't no question
Oh in and out of town
I ain't slept in
Weeks
You ready?
Look I been in and out town
Still making plays even when I'm out of bounds
Automatic champagne poppin', never out of rounds
Tell me where the throne at, that's where I be sitting down
I run up in your city, run a spot, run a town
Bet I run that motherfucker even when I'm not around
Only time to fuck, not to fuck around
I got weed, bad bitches, and money and they all a hundred pounds
Yea I got the blue print, these niggas tryna' trace
They tell me slow down but I'm in the human race
And I be damn if I ain't first, never living in reverse
I just hit it from reverse, swear that shit so crazy
Man L.A girls so crazy, how's it sunny if them hoes there shady?
And New York bitches screaming fuck you pay me
In ATL they be eating all their gravy
And Detroit man them girls so gangsta'
In Philly, I seen some pretty faces
Look, I love it when she up and down the pole
Make me wanna' take your ass up and down in Khol's
Have you ever been in Napa where they champagne, sipped in
Fly across the border to the 4-1-6, then go up to Philly where they know this shit legit
One time for the hood, man you know that we the shit
Come through in the city and you know, East Philly and you know I'm reppin' Philly
Man shout out to Meek Milly, I be going in this bitch, tell 'em silly
Oh god damn, we should pop a wheelie

Dream Chasers, what up though?
It's that Finally Famous boy, we out here reppin'
Since day one, look
I got a lot on my mind, I got more on my face
If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste
I'm trying to move in my safe, like the safe was a safe house
I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on a steak out
I'm looking through them magazines like this the girl I'm a take out
One time for Detroit, yea you know that's what stay out
Man you know, plotin' up in there man to find a way way out
Find a way way out, we had to fire our way way out
Music been bumpin' man we just waiting to break out
This the player you heard of, the young and assertive
I came from the dirt up and did it ya heard up
Hoes say I'm the man, 'uh huh I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment what the fuck is the purpose
No calling' my phone unless you the fam or my girl
I'm a just say there's no service, stayed connected it's cursive

Hold up, we about to switch it off

I was just finna go off.. Quill what up tho

Live life
Get High
Change the world, man do it all before you go
In Europe riding European so it's not a foreign though
They like "Show me the Moves", no time for a tutorial
There's levels to the game like "who put this shit on story mode"
His story; historical
Mister Anderson, I know Sway ain't got the answers so I'm looking for the oracle
All my favorite rappers told me "Life's a bitch"
So I'mma fuck the world through the glory hole
So that bitch can't take me to the Maury show
If she don't smoke weed, pop pills, suck d***
If there's one thing that I hate, man it's boring hoes
All my girls love me, so if I die today it'll be like 5,011 somethin' freaks at the memorial, ya bish
I hop up on the beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding 4 deep boy no AC
Heading to the game for OK seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC
I know KD
And all these singer girls know me like 'Doe Rae Me'
Foh Sa Lah Tee Doe, but dope come first
No late fees
Kool-Aid smile
Colgate Teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
Woop Woop
Got a couple screws loose
You was in the winner's circle you just tryna get off in the fruit
Fruit Loop
Turned nothing into two, something into new
I could write a best seller out of Alphabet Soup

I'mma get his whole mothafuckin' family
Look I ain't playin' with nobody
I come from 6 Mile, I ain't a cosby
Understand I came up nigga, yeah that's all me
The world is in my palm, mothafucka I need palm trees

Hol' Up, Hol'up
This is a special record ... I may need to go on this for real

Finally Famous

Now when they see you getting change
Don't you dare change
I'm saying you got big and ain't ever act the same
Don't you dare act Hollywood
Don't you dare act Hollywood
Now when they see you out of town
They see you in the streets
They say you act funny
Man, you can't even speak
Don't you dare act Hollywood
Don't you dare act Hollywood

Big, man I knew you do it big. New grid
With a house up on the hill
How I feel next to the sign that say, "Hollywood"
But I don't mean to act Hollywood
But my bitch is the baddest, ass is bigger than Jurassic
She moved out West, now she talking with an accent
Had a good doctor, now her titties look like plastic
Used to go to college, now she like, "Fuck a master!"
She gon' date an actor, rapper, lawyer, or a doctor
Somebody who could cop for her, get a ice rock for her
Maybe get a ring, she should date a boxer
And her friends don't even recognize her


Ooh, little mama, you so primadonna
Why you treat your Honda like it's a McLaren
I know you like nice things, Tiffany's and ice rings
Seen you down in campus
March is colder than that ice ring
Finna get your shade on, with your supermodel
He ain't gotta spill up though, I know he's super hollow
And I know you shallow ever since you hit that lotto
While you play in roles, you in movies, you got Emmies
You got Benjies in your Fendi, does your Charger have a Hemi?
If no, let it go, wait a minute 'til you blow
They're gon' say you're Hollywood
They're just trying to steal the show


Do it



Incredible, incredible
Incredible, incredible
The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible

I hear the people yellin, so it's time to get my save on
Bet that I could do in one day without a cape on
All I needs my Nikes, chain and my Bathing Ape on
And bet that I could clean this mess up without an apron
With no hesitation, got so much drive
All I need is four wheels and I'mma reach my destination
From where they on that cane like they need a hip replacement
Got on and got out, I even made a bitch replacement
Now she gon ride my dick til I need a dick replacement
Mr. Incredible, she still in amazement
Underground money safe in a dark basement
And I flash more than Powerpoint presentations
But with great power comes great responsiblity
The ones who don't cheer for me is trying to get rid of me
Im trying to make history, they trying to make me history
So I'mma see which one is really meant for me
The story of my life

The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible

And I check my highlights every time the news is on
Still stand out if we wore the same uniform
And my chick is finer than them models, but only five four-a
Idolize Kimora and in love with my aura
But love seems to be every hero's downfall
So even if she treats like me a king, there's no crown for her
Bitch recognize this power in my punchlines
See me as a meal ticket, but I'm not a lunch line
Crying for my help, but I can't fit them in my schedule
Put me on a pedastal, but if I lost it all
Some would flip like they was flexible, fake ass niggas man
Swear to God, eat a dick and everything that's edible
And I can't save everything and all
I would need the world's biggest memory card
When I die and my grave says in memory of
I hope somebody else will rise above and become incredible

The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible



As the crowd dies down, screamin' and appalause
As a bad broad opens the envelope
Lemme straighten up my tie that I worked so hard for
Already got my speech, cause this is my award
Like, thank you for the love and every look I get
Thank you to my last girlfriend cause she a bitch
She never held me down, so thank you for the lift
Cause I know she lookin' out like
Since before I got big, before they shot B.I.G
Thank you to my grandma for keeping me in line
Thank you to my momma cause she never stopped tryin'
Snatched me outta public school to keep me outta trouble
Paid for private school and picked up another hustle
Thank you for every wrong turn I made in life
Just remember, 3 lefts is the same as goin' right
As I'm goin' down this, thank you cause this is very long
Thank you for this award, that I've just won
If you goin' me you are only with some important
Hah, oh yeah I stretched out, stretched in
Checked out, checked in, sexed out, sextin'
Hey, I always was the best man
Could never had a bride cause I'm fuckin' all the best friends
Last but not least
Thank you for the rappers who all let me share a beat
Put their verse on it, thought that shit was sweet
Then I put my verse on it and I made 'em sound weak
I'm living off recordin', I hope that they recordin'
AV watch be worth a fortune, Ferrari Lambo Porsche and
Livin' dreams out of proportions, yeah bottle after bottle
But I never left the cork in, and you can't have a portion
Thank you to the devil, for tryna' bring me down
Thank you man to Kanye for bring me around
And tryna cut me off short, and run me off stage
So if you didn't hear your name, it doesn't mean I changed
Thank you to the metropolitan colleges I was rockin' with
Means more to me than oxygen, honestly, on some honest shit
Doin' them shoes, wasn't gettin' money
Still got by though, puttin' in budgets
Hell yeah, nigga, full of Benjamin hundreds
Niggas die young, Benjamin Button
I'm gone




On the come up
On the come up
Sun up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up
Come up
Gun up
All my young niggas on the come up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up

All my niggas live Italian
Eating spaghetti and salad
Last night, she just fucked a stallion
Inside of a palace
All my niggas live Italian
Loyalty is all I'm askin'
My whole squad run the atlas
Look, I feel like I was chose to the take
Care of the ones I'm close to
Kitchen looking like whole foods
Got the fam around like it's soul food
Damn, I do this shit for the set
Working all year till we set
Quick to check a bitch, yeah, I check her even though life's a game of chess
Cause I'm living play by play, day by day
No time for her honestly
And her face looking like a young shawty
Cause I gotta get it a hundred ways
But you know 'bout being down and out...



Abstain
You got to abstain
Yungboyz

"Civility is not a sign of weakness."

I'm just trying to let y'all see the way
Abstain and y'all will see some better days
Don't mess with drugs or try to creep
Unless y'all want to end up six feet deep

Big Sean 'bout to claim the game
When it comes to sex and drugs I stay abstain
I saw all my momma did for an easier world
I'mma mess it all up for a sleazier girl
Don't listen to these fast girls bringing drama
Cause they don't even want to be a baby momma
Listen, let me tell y'all 'bout Percy
Hustling on the corner selling coke and Hershey
Geared up too, straight down to his shoes
He had an E-class Benz on top of 22's
In his own head he thought he was lethal
Until he bumped heads with the wrong people
Now Percy was pissed, a push and a shuffle
A couple cats try to knock P for his hustle
To make a long story short, the gang got to his head
He heard a boom, he was dead
Shot, found under a bridge
Worst thing is he had a baby girl and a kid
Man, now how that sound to you?
Had a wife and a kid then his life was through
Caught up trying to make some money
For real, sex and drugs ain't even funny


I'm a dozen years old, keep my ... froze
Abstain the game, I fall to thugs ...
Avoid the drugs, stop girls from pregnancy, stop boys from sex
All I know's the whole world's correct
All the pollution, stop the confusion
People killing each other for no reason, everyday of the season
Who's looking at the face of the Earth? - Uh
Who's looking at you smoking a blunt? - Uh
Who's looking at you doing bad things? - Uh
Who's looking at you flashing a ...

I run this beat like my name was J Hova
Don't do drugs it will blow your mind over
Don't follow people when the streets dealing weed, it rude
Because your peeps looking straight at you


R-J-98, it's great
"Civility is not a sign of weakness."
"Whatever hater."



"Hurry up nigga, swear you taking too long
Spring break already passed, you been breaking too long
20 year restaurant shit, we waiting too long!
Hall of Fame on the way? On the way too long!"
I know, I been, saying the, same to myself
I treat the studio like I'm laying in the cell
Trying to raise the bar, staying to myself
Is it an oxymoron; niggas praying on my hell?
That don't make sense
Time is money, nigga tell me how your day spent?
Mine is doing business with people who got paid
And been paid since, "Sean changed since
He broke his high school girlfriend's heart
You know how niggas are"
Really? Shit, really?
That's hurtful seeing from your friends and fam
And the internet, even Necole Bitchie?
How many of you made it with your high school romance?
I made a visit to the school, role modeled to the youth
And had the teachers and the students hold hands
Yeah, I guess
Fuck it I'm not a good person just to get the press
Like how he used to smoke and drink just for the stress
Being blessed, made a Lex on some Detox shit
Lately I'm reading books on some Deepak shit
Still rocking more Adidas, less Reebok, bitch!
We want songs like "Memories", "Desire, Want & Need"
Motherfucka you can keep "Guap", bitch!
Take it back to the old Sean, before you had a Rollie
Man when you was wearing that G-Shock shit!
Saying
"I'm gonna make a million... Just wait till tomorrow"
Went from sleeping on floors, to making them marble
And to make it out my hood, is harder than leaving Argo
You got all the drive in the world, but your car broke
You up so late, the motherfuckin bar closed
But you need a drink "why you work so hard bro?"
Its for moments like this!
Moments for interview sentences is
How close you, Royce, and Em is?
How big is your mom new crib, and
Stupid shit like, is G.O.O.D. still your imprint?
But this for the ones that already know
Who been working all month just to save up for the show
Who paid the babysitter extra so they can go
Who paid a little more, to get early front row
Like "I'm your biggest fan, I can't believe I met you
Can we pose for Instagram?
I'm the one who knew every word, then "swerve"!
Drove eight hours here, I swear to God
This well desereved", Man, this one for you



I promise we gone live how we want
I promise we gone get all we want
Split the bill, naw forget the bill, look
We gon' buy the whole restaurant
Remember way back when we had said back then
We will be the ones to have arenas packed in
Livin' big time
Yup big time
To the point where my name could've been Big Ben
No matter what they gave out I never gave in
Without sunshine I never caved in
I'm Finally Famous 'til the lights is faded
Then the crowd is jaded
When I hop on stages

You don't live for life
So live your life
When you live and die
Look back and say you did it right
When you get it right
I hope it lasts for life

Last for life
Last for life
Last for life
Man I wish that this could last for life
Who woulda thought we'd get this far
You search your life for Heaven on Earth
When you get it right hope it lasts for life

I promise they gone all try and be me
I promise they gone know who we are
I promise we that gon' be successful
With or without the college degree
Remember old head use to tell my momma
That boy gon' be something that there I promise
So they should not expect nothin' less than to see us set like dinettes, I guess
And we all waitin' for tomorrow
Sometimes without acting you gotta deal with drama
Hey to get these dreams I figure it's gon' take more than Nyquil and pajamas
But they know what's up
We hoppin' out, and they know it's us
When we get it right
Look back and say
That we did it right
And hope it lasts for life

Last for life
Last for life
Last for life
Man I wish that this could last for life
Who woulda thought we'd get this far
You search your life for Heaven on Earth
When you get it right hope it lasts for life

Yo I remember I used to ride to school with my dog Tone
And we be like listening to Kanye, Jay-Z, you know like everybody, basically
And it's crazy now cause I do business with them
You know people always ask me like you know, "Why you ain't go to school? Why you ain't go to college?"
It's like man, I didn't go to college cause...this is what I want to do, you know what I'm saying?
This is my dream
You can ask Nigo who Big Sean man, and they know
I'm 20 years old man, I done been around the world. I done been around the world. I done been around the world doing what I love to do
Like, what more could you ask, you know? And that's real



Soon as I walk in
Nothing but talkin'
I beg my pardon for not begging pardon
Walk in the store, close all the doors
They know I am a very big copper like the warden
Matter fact you should award him
You should support him for being so important
Shh! Do you hear the applaudin'?
Camera recording? Roll out the carpet
Back in the spotlight, parallel parkin'
And I do not have time for the jargon
I hop on records, tend to break records
G.O.O.D. Music what you think I'm signed to the best for?
I mean I ain't really trying to trip
But what you mean "show'em Jay" you can't tell me shit

So umm, Let my money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Yeah, and times a hundred that
See I'm just trying to let me money stack
To hundred stacks, times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that

Beast
Got his bread up without yeast
Man the least I could do is not lease
So I paid of a bill
Imagine how I feel
Say my graces to the bank because I'm working on the mill
The hotels I check in with hoes I will check out
And I'mma get to sexing until a nigga sexed out

So let my money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that

Bape shit? Got it
BBC? Got it

You keep countin' that money, I'mma kill these niggas

Addicted to weed, bitches and big chains
Car so big Id crash if I switch lanes
Sayin' you the man nigga, quit playing
How you winning If I ain't switch teams
Bitch I had the same dream since I was sixteen
Rippin' life out of the plastic
Turnin' everything to platnuim
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson?
Meat Earl Mac and bunch of Tony Braxtons
Fill your cup to the f-f-fullest
Tell them if they actin' up and p-p-pull it
High off money, weed and, p-p-pussy
I didn't studder, so girl just d-d-do it right now

I used to seem to wonder what it feel like
Now I do what the fuck I feel like
Forever Reppin' When Im gone
I promise I'mma bring it back to home
And have my mother fucking weed rolled up and my champagne popping
I can't forget the girls, all around the world
Reppin' for my city, puttin' on with my crew
And I'mma keep this money just to blow it with them too

And when I see you and the last time
I never lead a state where bags climb?
And this my city when Im in it nigga stand down
All of my niggas, a lot of money and bad broads
I stunt hard like I got a fucking sad car
Money will turn you evil, and that weed will have you nervous
But them bitches get you cute, and the pussy more potent
But I dont give a fuck, im stating callin hoes over
Mr. weedman meet me at my shows if you holdin'
A lot of niggas want it, and a lot of niggas chase it
But a lot of niggas die before they make
So while im getting money im gonna blow it like my papers
Where the fuck my bottles, where my mother fucking waitress, sorry darling are we clear?
Im standin' as a man till' im ruined
The worst thing you could do to me is shit I should be doing
And if a niggas fronting I take two and put it through him
Im no killer but I kill for what the fuck I am pursing. for real

Forever Reppin' When Im gone
I promise I'mma bring it back to home
And have my mother fucking weed broke down and my champagne popping

Reppin' for my city, putting on with my crew
And I'mma keep this money just to blow it with them too. Hey



Yeah

Cause dey know, dey know, dey know
Do I really need an intro
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am
Do I really need an intro
Dey know, dey know, dey know
Do I really need an intro
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am

All I get is respect, as soon as I eject the vehicle
I bet you cannot detect, the scratch of a defect
From where the streets feast at, but made it out the belly of the beast without a C-sect
I'm so straight up, I'm so erect
Hype off that action, I'm so direct
I know it's a hundred thousand niggas up in Michigan
Doing it, but where I lack in talent I make up for it in discipline
And go hard, so hard til nobody else is on my sonar, radar, or lane cause I Bogart
Nowadays all we do is classic, Mozart
Outta here, it would be polite to send a postcard
I meant a post heart, yall niggas post hard
So lost co-star, coast off au revoir
I mean look at all we been in
And I look up in the mirror like boy you ain't even finished


Do they really need my info, to show them what they in for
I'm recognized like kinfolk, even when my brim low
I come from where that life talk, where dat where dat knife talk
D-town, be brown, more money than white chalk
And on them nights how we grind til its light out
Grind til the sunset, til my grandson set, yup
Yeah, man my kids gone have the good life
Good days, good nights, and not the wish I could life
Strongest survive it, they see he trying to make something outta nothing
They like damn he Macgyver
Damn he go live, but too good to try and let up
And im better than whoever put together




Do it again and i'll see you tomorrow
I wanna get it, You've got something to borrow
Give me, Give me right of my own
Cause when I throw you on again
I buy it but it don't measure up
What is the missing ingredient

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

Yea, Yea, Aye
I went from no Role Models to onto Road Models
So please do not tell me who the hell I should follow
I used to watch Puff pop gold bottles
Now they see anotha' Sean pop more bottles
Bitch I go full force, Skywalker
You, You Lukewarm.. I am your father
Sometimes you need a new deal depending on your cards
But if you talkin bout' the right cards
My hand is Hallmark
And naw I caint' tell you my secret
Cause if I did then you wouldn't need me bitch

I went and threw away my I.D



Eh everywhere we go, we know, are ya'll ready for this?


Man we going Harlem, Trot around the Globe and go
Places that you ain't know
You would go would that you could go
I be the man if you ever should go
Pull up to the party in my bestest clothes, then pose for the ho's
Good life nigga so we only pop mo, mo
Man toast to the rose
Rozay rose even hop up in the Royce
I'd be god damn if I ever go broke
I made it out the hood, didn't have to deal dope
And I'm on the block like defense, leading, never leaving, for a reason
Believe it


Everywhere we go, we know
Everywhere we go we, know


So now you a rapper, huh?
Your crew spent all day trappin, huh?
You and your niggas all smell like Vagisil
When I was in the hood like Castrol
Not by choice, more like force
Difference between me and you, you dreamed about a Porsche
I spit disease with no worts
Its a shame what you pay to see, It's cool you goin to pay for me
I never let this greedy world take from me
I ain't sleep but my dreams stay awake for me
See we do everything we dreamed we would
Hey say I can't, I say I could, man I should
Send these rappers to their death row like Suge












I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Soon as I walk in all the bad bitches on it

I saw you perform yeah, you put on a light show
I walk up in this bitch looking like a light show
Got a team but I’m by myself ISO
Killing shit lights on, lights on, lights off
On my job bitch, no nights off
And on my nights off, it still might cost

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Your girls on my dick and she trying to sit up on it
She hopped on my lap even took a pick up on it
And I passed her to my niggas cause I don’t really want it

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Brand new whip but I push it like it’s stolen
7-11 a nigga keep rollin’
I’m headed to the top bitch and I dont think you going
And how my checks look, stupid as hell
So tell me how my ex look, stupid as hell

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it

Ay, now every time I stepped in
You could tell I stepped out
I saw your girlfriend only from the chest down
I’m so dressed up but I pull her dress down
By the time she wake up, I’m in the next town

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I met your main bitch and I put my niggas on it
And she bust it wide open, hotel picture phoning
Send it all around the World so I don’t even want it
2,3 I’m in my zone bitch
Where’s the competition?
I need a clone bitch

I Don’t Think They Want It

And it look right, tell her keep going

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it

What you got? nothing!
What I got? everything!
You was straight gassin, I put that on kerosine
I just give her dick dog, you give her a wedding ring
You need her at the alter now that is just embarassing
Let em talk shit though, go ahead, carry on
I just walk up in this bitch higher than a carry on
Flyer than a carry on, sipping on Pérignon
Gripping on derriere, gripping off Derrion
Somebody show these weak niggas where the exit is
Cause they always trying to be where my section is
Why is your girlfriend always where the sexing is?

I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it



It is not good enough, it is not good enough
It is not good enough, it is not good enough

Nah, I was good enough for the shows and good enough to rock 'em
Good enough for people in the projects to college
That bump my shit, say my shit
Not good enough for radio to play my--
Said not good enough for the hood, too hood for Hollywood
Fall back like August, figured he probably would
Not good enough to make it, they figured he probably should
Then a couple years later, a nigga all good
Not good enough for her man but good enough for access
Too good for the racks, not good enough for the actress
Looked in the mirror, saw things more clearer
Said I look too good for my bitch not to be the baddest
I work too hard for my nights not to be the gladdest
A little too good just for trying to be average
And when they trying to do what I did
They trying to be big, they ain't good enough for that
My bad

It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough

Still waiting, scheming on my come-ups
Shooting for the stars, the reason I got my guns up
But maybe my aim off of, maybe I came off
Way too fly they ain't like that, they trying to delay my take off
Can't call it and can't ball if
I'm on this bitch, warning, how should I take all this
Say I ain't good, man you can't call, this that
And ass niggers give me no breaks, keep the Kit-Kats
Listen I been all them places you never been at
Made so many moves and all
Even them Jabbawockee niggers gotta ooh and aah, but in fact
There's no dancing but my hustle's definitely intact
Yeah, but let's put this all in perspective
I compliment this game like Lebron with the nets
And a charm with a necklace - a king, I'm not - respect, miss
Making this a long shot but I'mma all net this

It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough




Don't mess with Mr. T
Don't mess with Mr. T
Temptation...


Man I try I tried and I tried again
But the weed and the hoes the Coke and the Hen
All seem to know that I'm gon' give in
If my girl find out — one more 'gain
That I'm fucking around through her or her friends
Then she gon' leave like leaves in the winter
Meaning she cold
She hear about me and the twins that had on the twin skirts
Hit squirt hit the purp
And that bitch had the nerve to call out my name when my girl hit my chirp
"Hello?" Oh — that's just my cousin Kim
Her and her friends stopped by for a min
"Nigga, you over there lying AGAIN?!"
Damn. I know she ain't finna believe
She's fixing to leave
Cause Mr. T



I'm at home where the drama is grown as hell
And I'm still in my mama crib, ain't on no scholar shit
So it's no scholarships, man
But I do want some Prada shit, damn
That's when one of my mans
Came at me with an ounce of that yanz
Like "That's 'bout a grand"
But then I remember Mom telling me
Don't be on no corner retailing weed
Ecstasy or whatever it be
Cause that life ain't straight, like L and B
Hard-headed like working at factories
Cause I got in the game like athletes
Now I'm in the correctional facility

Focus

Focus can be the difference between on and off
Winning and losing
Good and great
Between great and the best

Focusing could be the most self-fulfilling thing you could do for yourself because with focus comes accomplishment
Focusing could bring out your greatest talents and give you true purpose in this world
It can take your natural ability and magnify it to extraordinary
One thing I learned and I'm sure most of us know is what you focus on
What you put your energy into
Is exactly what we should expect back
That's just the law of the universe

Karma
I seen it happen like 10,000 times
It is proven that 1+1 being two

Focus is the key to being successful in any situation
If you focus on the wrong, you'll get the wrong things
There's no way to focus on one thing and expect something different
How you focus on something is giving attention to it
Even if you don't like it and still focus on not liking it, you're still putting your attention to it and will still attract it

For example, if you focus on wanting a new car, you'll keep attracting the idea of wanting a new car
But it is easy to confuse that, because wanting a new car isn't the way to manifest it
You're simply just wanting a new car and not obtaining a new car
Remember, the intent of your focus is so important
There's a difference between focusing on wanting a new car and focusing on a car being yours
We really should be clear on what we focus on

Honestly, I feel like time is the most valuable thing we have ever been given and focus runs parallel to that
Because every second of the day we're focused on something, whether you realize it or not
I for sure am a victim of focusing on the wrong things sometimes
I spent a little too much time on my phone looking at comments, focusing on how it'd feel a little too long
But that's just human

It's very rare that you'd probably focus on 100% of your time on what you need to
But the biggest advantage is to quickly catch yourself and be able to reset your focus
For me, there's no way I could focus on something I don't love
At least not for long

I'm just not content with my spending my life miserable and I just personally can't live like that
It is not a party of vibration you could tell how you feel
Your inner guidance system
Your feelings
If I feel good, I'm doing the right thing
If not then it's not what I'm supposed to be doing

How does what you focus on makes you feel?
Remember, it's never too late or too early to know what makes you happy and to make that change by any means necessary
I went into my last album focused
I wanted to focus on making music that would change people's lives, help lift their moods up
Music that I felt that was undeniably great to me and talk about what directly affected me
And that's what I did
I never focused so much on executing these things while making music and what'd you know?
My first number one album and my most successful one yet

You can't measure success by anything but happiness
I say that all the time
And if you focus your energy on what makes you happy
What do you think will happen?
Exactly
It always work out

Rewire any thoughts you had prior and know that you are what you focus on

Focus



Paper Chaser
Paper Chaser
Yeah
And Whoever's on your grind and got a swag like mine
Say "I'm a paper chaser"
And I'mma keep getting money
'til you haters just love me cuz
I'm a paper chaser

Yeah and I know she can't say no, all she see is green so she ridin' when I'm sayin' so
And if it's mulla I got handles like a dino
I won't loose control, now why don't you loose control
Chasin' this money i think I'm gonna loose my soul
But fuck it if it move my momma to a better home
Cuz I'm a paper chaser, I like baithin' apea
And even G's get shocked like my watch was a tazer
I am an ultimate warrior with this cheese grater
That means I go hard, chasin' this..


GOOD Music, yeah, yeah, BIG
They said it's just not fair, conquer competition
And they could never match my commitment to commission man
I ain't trying to gas you up nigga I ain't ethanol
Bringin' home that bread and bacon
I got high cholesterol, my nigga I get it, what about you
I promised mamma' Benz and a new house too
And man I'm addicted to that good pasta and that cooked lobster
Paper chasin' I'm gon' probably need a foot doctor
LL I'm in love with the label boy
Bitch I'mma dog I wake up and chase the paper boy
But do you niggas really know about paper?
But do you niggas really know about paper?
GOOD Music

Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hard top
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up, Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise
So my dog can quit wearing a 44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in piece while he alive
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
Seems life's never at a stand still, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't school teach more mathematics
Less trigonometry and more about taxes
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life, instead of lab rat us
With a mansion that's about 5 floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got 5 more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we'd catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speed boat my dad always wanted
I swear I feel it coming
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
Is this a dream, well that's how it feels
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise Hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace of society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varities
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough, man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy, switching lanes in the range swerving all crazy
Style on the dial, I've been serving ya'll lately
Cheddar on Federer
Ball 'till I fall, et cetera, et cetera
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world







Yeah


I bounce back in this bitch like a reflex
It’s obvious they trying to stop Sean like an eclipse
I’m laughing out loud to the point I might cry
Cuz nobody blocking mine like a nigga 9-9
See I am a phenom, you are a feline
You are a bitch, boi! Sweeter than key lime
D-Town
The bullets and the people seem to ménage
Hit you in your shirt, now your chest look like a collage
This is not a fairy tale or facade
Niggas tripping to the point, nowadays I’m yelling “Bon Voyage”
So in and so forth, I go in and go hard
And when it’s time to go on, bet everybody go off
Yeah, I know you niggas can’t stand my city
How they feel to hear a “Big” this good still living?
I came from the bottom
Remain at the bottom
Yeah it floods when it rains at the bottom
But my dynasty reign bitch, rain till we drowning
And you’re broke until you realize something
I’d rather keep coming in the set and see nothing
They like how he make something, when they ain’t give him nothing


Label full of stars like the fucking flag or something
Everytime we do a show it’s like a hip. hop. summit
You hang with niggas draped in Louis Vuitton
I hang with the niggas who make Louis Vuitton
Ima bring it home, designated driver
And all we want was money and power
Till they see our money rose like flour
Just call it Creflo Dollars
My grandma say I’m reckless
Big cars, big cribs, big bills
Always was a big deal way before the big deal
And that’s real

Perpetrating wack verbalation
Percolating like he ice skating

The fake work he making
Like he really put in work to make it
His chain hanging I should take it
But I ain’t like that
Just introduce me to the right track
And say fuck it like we naked
I don’t ever feel disrespected
Cuz I know I’m on the right track
Doing what I can to make it
From the heart I can never fake it
From the soul and I hold it sacred
Intellectual vocation
Unite the whole nation
While i'm on an international vacation
Holy carnations

One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long

Iraq in this bitch/Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch//Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch

Now why why why/Would you compare me to you
If you think we're equal/Then bitch, you are remedial
Remember who you're speaking to/Call it egotistical
But I am one of one, Yup and there is not a sequel, sequel
Soon as I approach in/Please do not approach him
Please try and test us/One hand gesture
We'll fill they ass with lead like standardized testing, testing
And you already know where I live
How could I make it out that bitch being a bitch
Bet a stack I'll make your bitch come over
There's diamonds on deck like a nigga playing poker
I hear them niggas talkin' but bet all they do is look
See, to you I'm Mr. Big but to him, I'm Mr. Bush, Bitch. Look, bitch


Success brings envy
I gotta watch out for these jealous thugs
So I am working with these mags like editors
I went from trapping to rapping to make a extra buck
But now I keep that shotty by me like a Elmer Fudd
McFly shitting, I know the haters smell us
I make it hard to breathe they need oxygen inhalers
I'm so froze I need a double sweater//I got two softball hoes
And every time I run home, they give me double headers
You can't come to my city talking absurd
And don't take it from me, just ask Young Berg
So if I snatch your bitch, you better get to walking
You think you cute? You probably look better in a coffin
Flight leer ice gear, Phantom, I just must steer
Little nigga just build a buzz/You just had a light year
And I am sick of all of this hating shit
Had 'em dumping like a bad ass relationship




Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way

5,4,3,2,1 blunts passed off
Pick your planet, roll it, toke it, smoke it, then we blast off
I'll probably be on mars when I light up
Clean up, then head down to Venus to get wifed up
The nigga in me wanna go to Pluto to get iced up
Race through space
Damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without the luggage
But there's baggage cause I bagged it
If the police see I have it
Flash the badge and they'll try to



Man you already know

Big Shan I see you, we made it

It’s good music baby, still finalizing it
It’s all good, it’s been Finally Famous

You know me, a few hundred for the tee on
Same for the jean on, shit you don’t be on
Man I ain’t Celine, but I’m finna put the D on
Went from doing talent shows to a colosseum
I’m on deck like a shipwreck, damn
Man I get big checks like my nights with six X
That’s high sixty
And I’m busy like bone thugs with more buzz
Than four cups, that’s mo’d up and showing up
They talking ish again, you too?
Man I was on the road with bands like U2
Other side of the globe with the flow doing shows
Man I could give a damn about niggas on YouTube
And I’m from the hood around the boulevard
Funny now ‘cause I’m on Hollywood boulevard
So when I drive by, there’s camera’s shooting at a nigga
Call it Hollywood’s drive by

I got the D on lock man
Streets gon’ watch man, man, man
I got a few stacks in the knock
Can’t fit ‘em in the sock like, like, like
And the girl’s come with dollars now
So they all follow now, now, now
I’m the man with the facts
You can check the stacks
Look, look, look

You know me, you know how I do
Mink on the coat, alligator on them shoes
Buffalo tux, Cartier with the jewels
But enough about me, homie what about you?
You ain’t gotta adore me
But you’ll surely, T-C-E-P-S-E-R me
Spell it backwards since you try to reflect me
Try to be me in the mirror
You’re reminded, respect me
And if you got a handkerchief
Go and get it out dude
Money talks, and I’m talking with my mouth full
Uh, so excuse me for spitting
I got the Gucci grip so you won’t catch me slipping
I got a dumb swag but I’m rather intelligent, hmm
I went to college just for the hell of it
I came in, took a look, then I took it over
I barely went to class
And when I did, it was over
I was coming just for the hoes anyway

I got the D on lock man
Streets gon’ watch man, man, man
I got a few stacks in the knock
Can’t fit ‘em in the sock like, like, like
And the girl’s come with dollars now
So they all follow now, now, now
I’m the man with the facts
You can check the stacks
Look, look, look

Rollin' with my crew
And them
Cruisin' in
Oh is that your man?
SIKE!
Choose again
Hold up, hold up
Stop
At my outfit
Everybody waving at me
And who all I'm out with
Damn he bon voyagin'
Ladies show me love
La-ladies show me love
And all my niggas
Give me pounds and
D.J. play my song when
I start standing on
The couches
And I bet, I bet, I bet
My shit is the loudest
Sippin' like a like that bitch
Come straight up out a fountain
I'm crazier than a motherfucker
I might need some counselin'
So pour it up, till we throw it up
Roll it up, blow it up
I just hope you legal
You should come to my
Apartment
We could make a movie
And your girls could make the sequel
But before we do..
Could you do it for..
Me and my people!


Everywhere I go
I go with all my people
And I'mma get this money
Just to blow with all my people
You know me ah
Gone like that tree high
And I'm up in the crowd
Like motherfuck
The V.I.....P!
Call me B.I
Told ol' girl in knee highs
To go put down that glass
And grab a bottle that is knee high
And I'm just so important shit
That they might be important shit
How it feel to waste liquor
That niggas cannot afford to sip
She be on that X times 3
Like it's a porno flick
My chain look like a ornament
Touch it
And you'll get that red dye
Like we recordin' shit
Terminator 4 and shit
Drinks pourin'
Now that all the cash pourin' in
Boi!
And I don't live off in no forest
But it's girls off in my bed
Like they aid
Hold, stop, drop,EGO
Before you do
Could you do it fo'
Me and my people!




Got a blank check so Ima scribble what I want, sc-scribble what I want, sc-scribble what I want
Pocket full of money so I’m gettin’ what I want, ge-gettin’ what I want, ge-gettin’ what I want

I walk around laughing but there ain’t shit funny
Damn it feel good to be that nigga gettin’ money
While y’all ain’t gettin’ nothing, I’m still gettin’ money
Since the nigga gettin’ bread, they bound to feel crumby

Watch me
I see you gettin’ money, I be -
I see he gettin’ money, she be -
I see she gettin’ money, we be -
We gettin’ money now got the haters like

Not to sound conceited
But when you see what my bank receipts is
You gon' want to be on top of my sheets like lines to loose leaf
I'm on my green like vegans, that's vegetarian
I see you staring at the new V, Hiccup
Pockets got a sixth sense, all they see is dead people
Mhmm I pay the haters no mind
'Cause I never knew they name
But I know they know mine
Ask any bad broad bet I know she knows Sean
GOOD Music bitch, I know you know Kan-Ye
Yup, he's the reason that I'm paid
One look at you will make me thank God that I'm made
The girls that call me ugly is the ones who wanna love me
So now I let 'em love me, when I'm done I call 'em ugly, yes
If money stinks I admit I'm pretty musky
Eatin' till I'm chubby boy

I walk around laughing but there ain’t shit funny
Damn it feel good to be that nigga gettin’ money
While y’all ain’t gettin’ nothing, I’m still gettin’ money
Since the nigga gettin’ bread, they bound to feel crumby

Watch me
I see you gettin’ money, I be -
I see he gettin’ money, she be -
I see she gettin’ money, we be -
We gettin’ money now got the haters like

We rollin' in the dough, ro-rollin' in the dough
Nah, nah, that ain't all of it man
I can't give you all that neither
Coming to y’all very, very soon
I promise















Uh-huh
I took you to that expensive restaurant, you so picky please
I still ain’t hit this week so next week is Mickey-D’s
Girl no hickies please
I know that she feeling me, so Ima take her back to the crib to come feel on me
Your name is Tiffany?
Her name is Hillary
Together I almost slipped up and called you Tiffillary
Girl is you kidding me?
Can’t meet your mom though, I just wanna take you right back to my condo
And I’m hoping I’m turning you on like a console
‘Cause with that weave in your head you lookin’ like Tonto
So Ima want the breast and thigh with that, like the combo
She know I’m in charge, she callin’ me the head honcho
And baby I’m afraid if I can’t get that skirt off, then Ima probably hop up in the whip and skrrt off
‘Cause playing hard to get nowadays is such a turn off
And you gon’ feel different as soon as you sip on this Smirnoff
You dig?


Listen, I got short ones, fat ones, Indian and black ones
He one hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes
One hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes

I realize that I don’t need hoes, they need me
Soon as they see me, “Oh, I heard your CD”
I know they wanna hop on my peepee
So presidential, I should move to DC
You could ask Kiki, Michelle, and Niecy
They all, take it to the summit like BGs
That’s bubble guts, damn
And I ran through a couple sluts, that’s a whole lotta bubble butts, word?
Periodically like the shuttle bus
And Ima probably order all them hoes some Moet
‘Cause that get ‘em more wet and that mean more sex
Girl, call up your friend, let me come hit the whole set
And Ima probably have them hung up like the coat check
Girl, get on your knees let me give you a throat check
And since they and their friends want some, oh them hoes next
And Ima probably work them all out like the Bowflex
And you and your friends could all watch like Rolex


Listen, I got short ones, fat ones, Indian and black ones
He one hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes
One hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes



I'ma uh

More hotels than I could ever rent
More bitches than i could ever sleep... with
More faces than i could ever know
More weed than i could ever blow
More fans from grow a every show
And we go...

Oh oh off the glow, glow...

Oh oh off the glow
No one pulling me down, me down...
Growing, growing...
We're cheating, cheating
Somebody dreaming
But you just living



When I woke up this morning
All I could think about was you
Cause when I went to sleep last night
All I could think about was you
Adam and Eve don't eat that fruit
'Best believe I'mma eat that Boo
Cause I'm the nigga that told them niggas
That told them niggas, 'Bout you
Chuck the duce, while I'm ridin' through
Tityboi I might sign a boob
Your nigga hatin', tell your nigga that's hatin'
That if he gettin some paper I might sign him too
'Best believe I'm just slidin' through
Put your panties to the side let me slide through
I can see you niggas from a side view
I'm in and out the pussy, drive through
White coupe, with the white rims
I like to crank the top and let the light in
You know she dark skin her friend light skin
Put us together, and it's Ice cream
Sandwiches she can't manage it
I know her man Is sick, she can't handle it
She need some time alone I told her call my phone
And when she call my phone I didn't answer it

I'm gonna smoke till you niggas can't smoke no more
Roll till your bitches can't roll no more
I'm gonna blow till you niggas can't blow no more
Blow till your bitches can't blow no more

I was in Detroit, Michigan after going to go visiting with some friends of mine

B-I-G
Okay I'm in motion, I'm rollin' and smoking
And smoking and rollin' like I'm locomotion
I'm walking outside and I'm causing commotion
Got perp and champagne that's a real nigga potion
I'm burnin' bread toasin' and joking
Cause I went from views of my moms house to views of the ocean
Niggas talk shit, But that's free promotion
I'm living my life like the end is approaching
Man fuck these niggas with a passion
I'm gettin' paid from the cradle to the casket
My Grandma said boy you need to read a bible chapter
Till I bought her ass a house bigger than the Pastor's, Hallelujah
Your now fucking with a bad bitch connoisseur
My ex-girl said man the fame caught up to ya
Baby you don't still think about me, wet dream about me
I swear you use to couldn't wait to k.o

Blow till your bitches can't blow no more



Intro]

Man I remember days I used to get up
Praying like a bishop that this music stuff would pick up
I always tried to haul my own load like a pickup
No ordinary nigga
And if you work harder then success will come quicker
But make sure you don't take it to the head like liquor
Aim for the stars, I’m shooting for the bigger dipper
Nights I used to sit up
Man I could feel the hunger in my stomach like sit-ups
Now I’m eating to the point that a nigga got the hiccups
I get up like, damn
I see the sun shine through the dust clouds
We bought our own cars, no more taking the bus now
And it ain’t bust a broad or hoes that we bust down
You should probably see the model chicks that we bust now
And we don’t chase them ‘cause they wanna chase us now
All my ex-dames say they wanna make up now
Take ‘em to the room and they wanna rape us now
Damn

We never will, we never will

We never will, we never will

Man I went through the cold nights
The wrongs and rights
But I woulda did it twice for the hoes and the highs
The fights, the struggle on the grind, the hustle
But I woulda did it twice for the shows and the lights

Man my city a hell hole like we like with Satan
Tried to make it to Penn State, they throw us in state pen
I’m saying from the rim of the capitol
Concrete jungle where they hunt you like animals
Cut you in half like the sandwich and abandon you
You gon’ need a bit more than a bandaid to bandage you
Damn it dude
And if you turn your back they might stab you in the kidneys
Really niggas known to keep the peace a hippy
But now I tend to spread my wealth around like Jiffy
And the hoes that used to diss me is the ones who wanna kiss me
The ones who wanna kiss me is the ones who wanna quickie
They see I ball hard now, all nine innings
I feel like I made it to the top of the mountain
Rocking designer shit that you don’t be pronouncing
Pissing in fountains
Getting money to the point I need an accountant
Just to count it, yeah

We never will, we never will

We never will, we never will

Man I went through the cold nights
The wrongs and rights
But I woulda did it twice for the hoes and the highs
The fights, the struggle on the grind, the hustle
But I woulda did it twice for the shows and the lights

Man shoutout to me and my crew
Feels good to make something out of nothing, you know
Aye DJ why don't you play some of my shit, man?



D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, im the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover

Big Sean
You can't fight this
With no matches
Im enlightened and im nicest
Call Mastercard cause he priceless
You can't buy this
They wanna turn around and ask me how life is
Its tee-riffic
The American Dream?
He is it
He lives it
He get the people moving like they evicted
I spit C.L. smooth over that beat box
Then get a verse from Piff, now thats Pete Rock
And since i got my advance
And i made a couple grand
I'll never stand there on that deep dot
I guess this life was made to be
I wasn't made for the world, it was made for me
Where everybody feel a nigga like they raping me
But imma be on by the next train home


I'm MC so cozy
Household name like the furniture mane
Shouts to House Shoes and Dilla, all day
I spit crack nigga, i've been dealin' all day
Anybody can get it like minimum wage
So give me that mic let me get on the stage
Vibe with it if you feeling it, aye
If not you can skip it like some of the twelfth grade
Think i've been spittin' since maybe the sixth grade
Wishing these niggas would listen is my aim
Shit on the game like birds over stadiums
I'm a playboy
At the Palladium
People mover young Piff, no train
At been the same since i seen soul plane
Cause we all gotta leave someday
I pray that i miss like he got no aim




Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around here
Money being made around, money being made around

No duh
‘Cause it ain’t nothing funny round here
About all of this money being made around here
So you ain’t getting none unless you running with my peers
And I keep that money coming anywhere that I appear
Get real, I been getting cash money since the juvenile
So niggas gonna feel it more that root canals
Sure, they ball the block like they hoopers now
But to me they translucent, dawg I can’t see them, no
And I’m ahead of them in every way
They front row and I’m center stage
If they cold then I’m Winnipeg
Belligerent
Money is continuous, he would of thought I hated cash
‘Cause every time I’m getting it, I’m giving it, spending it
Balling like scrimmages
Getting lost percentages of all of my dividends
I got money nigga

Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around, money being made around

This is the young heathen
And I do keep that money coming like it’s semen
So it’s never leaving as long as I’m breathing, believe it
There others temporary like seasons, I’m at the four seasons
My kick game is insane, pockets is on Rick James
I’m rich mane, ain't have to sell crack
I left that rock alone like big Dame
My ends raise bodies high as astrals, I’m Castro
They putting out shit like assholes
I’m fast forward as Flo-Jo
These homos moving slow-mo as old folks
They love me ‘cause I’m straight up like goal posts
With steady income, and they’s up and down like pogos
Boy, I’m getting money, money, money, like the bank
With money out the ass, I’m pretty sure it stank
Like ew!

Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around, money being made around

Now if the door’s lifting up, that’s money
If you got your car kitted up, that’s money
Now if a brother on the block, that’s money
Ladies if you baby daddy’s got a job, that’s money
Now if you’re on your own business, that’s money
And if you living independent, that’s money
If you got your own degree, that’s money
And if you got your own CD, that’s money

Yeah listen, I got this
And urban legend like the Lock Ness
I’m out of hand like a mosh pit
So they laying off me kinda like these automotive jobs did
See my apprentice, small as infants
Plotting on me, I can smell it in the air like incense
For instance I’d give you proof like evidence
No questioning and I’m shining like heaven is

Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around here
Money being made around here
Money being made around here
Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around, money being made around

In order for us to make this thing work, man
We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes?)

Ba-ha-ha-ha...
Yes, yes, y'all

Ah, ah




You know
We was gettin busy on the album everyday
We been gettin funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Knowmsayin?

And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kickin it with back in the day?



But first I gotta like introduce it
Youknowmsayin?



Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' games people play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
So don't you never come around here, talkin that talk
Or walkin that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! L'll have you breakin' locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin forties of beers
On the Boulevard


Hey yo Uncle L, let's go...

Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little somethin'

Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleein' like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's gettin buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mutha...'s comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handin me a mic is like givin' a chainsaw to Leatherface
Smokin MC's in an instant
At my side bustin caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip makin you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo


Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin' mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leavin' bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreadin' terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was -
Yo, what's up?
Nine years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?


I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you - won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?


Now you heard the brothers speakin 'bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hittin', beats kickin', you can't get none
F-A-R-M-E-R-S passin' the test
Marley Marl in the background doin the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, Kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard
Keep on
To the beat, y'all
A funky beat, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop



Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

Three percent tint
I can clearly see out
But you can barely see in
The end and on the end
We blowing Indonesia
And I'mma let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy the haze got me hazy I'm lazy
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive



I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant
I'm so high i won't, remember it
And i wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne
All the people plotted with
Is the same ones i'm dividin' the profits with
Now i'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some liu kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like i grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some bruce wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're high heels

Cause right now it's all, irrelevant
I'm so high i won't, remember it
Cause' the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love andthen join the mile high club
Yeah i'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams

Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah i gotta big head ho, i think it's crown size

Rollin' it up in traffic

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way

5,4,3,2,1 blunts passed off
Pick your planet, roll it, toke it, smoke it, then we blast off
I'll probably be on mars when I light up
Clean up, then head down to Venus to get wifed up
Race through space
Damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without the luggage
But there's baggage cause I bagged it
If the police see I have it
Flash the badge and they'll try to

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way

Green, yellow,orange, brown, red and that purp purp
Got me on my Final Frontier like Captain Kirk Kirk
Not to be on my ball sack
But, this isn't Star Trek
So puff the magic dragon and hop on my flying carpet
Preacher told me I should listen to more Mary Mary
But, I love Mary so much Imma probably marry Mary
Mary J. naw

Mary Jane like Peter Parker spot a maid
And I hope she feel the same

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way

Zoomin' the reason that I'm cruisin'
It's cause I'm steady waitin' to exhale
Blowin' on that Whitney Houston
She get me so emotional, delirious
If I hit more than a few times I'm tearin' up
And when life tear me up, god damnit it tear me up
She can be my mascot, always there to cheer me up
Oh my God I'm goin' I'm goin' I'm gone
Call me on my phone nah my nigga I'm zoned out

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way

Then we blast off
Then we blast off



D-Town
Westside, yeah, I said it, westside
You are now rocking with the newest, newest best out
Go and roll that good up, 'cause I'm stressed out
I come a city where nine-eleven dialled up
Everybody riled up, a hundred gun pile up
They'll lay it on the line, line, make sure you don't get filed up
Hammers in and out of court, boy, don't get trialled up
Yeah




Alarm clock said i'm too late
And they said i'm too weak I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
Well how long would you take?
Waiting's got me here in the first place
Another second, i've been second maybe third in the worst case
Now it's displayed in my wordplays
Moving weight, it's such a trap
Move and wait, you can't do that
I know i'm dope man but I can't move crack
And it's such a fracture when you're thinking 'bout your plans

But I try and bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the Sedans
Ride with Mr. right on time, or stay Miss. another chance
Now, redirected at the girls, not an ultimatum just an option in this world
When things come and go, when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot

No wonder why misses right just keeps on gettin left out

Gettin higher earnins and my desires yearnin
100 blunts rolled, You can smell the fire burnin
I'm in the fast lane, You can smell my tires burnin
Exercise, Flex on guys, Model chick
S** on thighs, I might let Alexis drive
Jesus chain testify, I over Accessorize
Test her out na she gon need a stretcher when I stretch her out
When it's time to speak man all of ya'll listen, When you up in the party
Man why is all the broads missin, And I just drop lines
Like a nigga goin fishin, Man and I be on them posters like a nigga gon missin
And I'm so hollywood that I might make yo bitch audition

Could use a f-ckin wrench, and I'm jus lookin at the game like they can use
Make me c**, but I bet that money come faster, Kanye first
Then I'm comin after, and louievaton shoes hoe
Dimes and the jaspers, Who, her, I ran through her walls
Made her scream and disapear, But hell naw my name is not casper
Boy, What the fuck these rappers sound like, Ha just a whole bunch of my sound bites
First whip Garbo, Second whip Largo, Don't
Worry bout my niggas they're good, Marshall
Bank account got me feelin well, Fargo
Ballin 'till I get a milla-check Darco
I just give em line afta line, afta line afta... Afta line, afta line, Bar codes

Charcoal, Me, Don, C, Tone and 54 bitches, The seeds finna blow

Feat. 2 Chainz
Boiii, GOOD
So this is what it feels like to make something outta nothing huh?
For a young nigga to start with nothing and get muthafucking rich on ya dumbass
Finally Famous

Bitch, my life is nothin' but a G thing
Pick up a 100 G's, take off a G-string
Clique full of G's and some bad-ass bitches
Oh, your ear to the streets? Okay, well, holla if you hear us
I keep it G, I keep it G, I keep it G, I keep it G
I keep it, I keep it, I keep it

Okay, my life is nothin' but a G thang
Pick up 100 G's, take off a G-string
Oh, Jesus, they love me to pieces
Got up in the game cause I was tired of the bleachers
Get rich, repeat it, taste it, I'm delish'
Lookin' so good she put me on her fuck for free list
I turn her on 'fore I go in
I swear that pussy keyless
I might let her ride the mic and let her friend come get the remix
Oh boy you do it
I'm ridin' 'round the city, in a rich nigga whip
Yea a nigga paid a grip, for all this rich nigga shit
And all these bad hoes, they want a rich nigga's dick
O God, this life is such a blessin'
See I smoke 'til I can't smoke no more and drink is no exception
Man these crazy niggas crazy, nigga when you gon' learn yo lesson
They won't talk shit about you plaques, but they gon' talk when you are restin'
Man, so fuck 'em


10 Ben Franklins, nigga, that's a G homie
Flash the pinky ring, baby you can ski on it
Put it in your uterus, U-Haul, I move the shit
Baby I'm a shark and these rappers taste like tuna fish
Look at this, movie with no movie script
I die real, do this shit
Just bought an old-school so that's my newest whip
Cartiers on, I can see all through the shit
I spell southside with an F that stand for foolishness
Fuck that shit, fuck with us, we'll have you in some luxury
I need a stash pot for a couple keys
When I'm in the Gucci store, I spend some G's to wear some G's
If you is a sucker, I'm a charger, where's the sucker fee?
Luckily, smoking on that vote for me, Presidential evidence
Truck so big, I can't park it at my residence
Wallet so big, I can't put it in my back pocket
Soon as her ass dropping, the cash dropping


I turned my old car into a new
My basement into a presidential view
One into two, a milli to a few
Niggas want to see me fall off, ah shit
I'll fall off and turn into you
Fuck around, turn this peace sign to a piece
I feel like slappin' a ho
Keep a bad bitch at the passenger door
Never ever break these broads off a lil'
Once you give 'em something they be askin' for more
If I run out then I'm snatchin' up yours
Man I remain a quadruple-triple OG, triple OG, triple OG
And that's a sign that I'm a made nigga that's fasho



You know we had to get it in, get it in
Scheming, whole team just scheming
Okay, me and my whole team seam to put it all together
It's time to make the moves that's gon' put us on forever
'Cause they say Don, like my foot is on the pedal



Hands up in the air
I just want the baddest bitch in the world right here on my lap

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

Okay, now where that alcohol? You ain't even got to ask
'Cause I'mma drink it all like, like it's my last
She a 7 in the face, but a 10 in the ass
She even look better by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the Certs off in this muthafucka
I'mma need the baddest broad to twerk off in this muthafucka
I'mma go hard 'til it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'm a boss so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
The work, and I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could put you on
See you look like Beyoncé so do it like Beyon
Do it like Beyoncé and put it on Sean
Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

Now, I'mma fill this glass up like it's my last
I'mma blow this bag up like it's my last
I'mma spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'mma make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All all up in my face like you remember who I am
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'mma just tell you, it's everything that I expected
Bitch, boi

Hands up in the air

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

Big ass bottles, Big Ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public 'cause
'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch, you ain't doing nothing

And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all

D-Town. G.O.O.D


          
          
        

I'm finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game barely started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can

Starter, only hit the bench when Im liftin'
Priceless, but they still gotta pay admissions
I'm so far ahead that I could pause and take pictures
Hold the autographs, I'm a shot away from winnin' it all
Hell yea Im goin' for the title
And if your name is on the title then finna get the white out
So many cameras flashin' I can't even tell its night out
I swear I saw the reaper, guess I'm finna bout to play my life out
Lights out
Everytime I'm coming down
Cuz I will knock you out like you weigh 100 pounds
Bartender, I'ma probably need 100 rounds
Theres only one king, and not another crown
Tryna pay my tool like where is the pay station
Whole crowd packed, like they finna vacation
Doing everything in the world that I planned
So now I tell my dreams, c-catch me if you can

I finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I said I bet you can't walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can

Now look, you can try and keep up, you probably gonna pass out
Yeah I took your girlfriend and turned her into my mascot
Hometown hero but I'll never pull my mask out
I bet the crowd love me, love me like I hit the last shot
Sometimes your first shot could be your last shot
Just see what I do when the ball get passed out
And my shadow is the only thing Im fearin'
And if I need to see my idol, I just look up in the mirror
So I'm the one they stand and applaud for
And guess who they goin bring out that award for
I hope they shinnin' up the medal case
Cuz the only thing I'm runnin' from is second place
Im still hungry, Im on my second plate
You a little guy, you need some extra weight
Bet everybody call me Big
Go hard or go home, so I'll don't ever see the crib

I finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can





When I said it was over, I shot right through your heart
Why did I let these hoes there what we had right apart
Ooh, you was so mad. I should’ve seen this coming right from the start
I should beware, beware, beware, of a nigga with a broken heart


Praying to a sky all black
Lookin at the stars like they finna talk back
Lookin at my phone like he finna call back
But last night I feel like I probably ended all that
Cuz by now he would’ve sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Sayin “fuck you, I miss you, or I hate you so much.” Cuz guys only say I hate you to the girls that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows, it comes, it goes
They say be real I try, I don’t
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
But two times don’t change everything
He ask my why I don’t feel the same, I’m still the same
He still insane and now he’s sayin


When I said, it was over, I shot right through your heart
Why did I let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, you was so mad, I should’ve seen this comin right from the start
I should beware, beware, beware, of a nigga with a broken heart


Ok skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke, lie, still, Danny, ew, time, kill, months, still
I got someone baby daddy callin me zaddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want the addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in the cabby
Third row, when he call I hit cancel
Damn I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my purse for the whole night
And he heard a nigga groanin till my phone died
And he like, why you stay talkin to my homie
Why the fuck you run around with plan b’s
Why did I get this tattoo, man fuck this tattoo
You was the reason why I wasn’t single in high School, all cuz I had you, bitch I don’t even have you
How am I suppose to get past you
Then he go to the next bitch spilling the real shit
Now they got problems she gotta deal with


When I said, it was over, I shot right through your heart
Why did I let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, you was so mad, I should’ve seen this comin right from the start
I should beware, beware, beware, of a nigga with a broken heart


Boy, don’t believe them hoes, cuz they don’t wanna see us together
You already know you too fly, but baby, don’t get ya head stuck in the propellers
I be tryna tell him these niggas is jealous
They don’t like it when you never say never
Dread head, Brown skin, but his goals is zealous
Muah, I French kiss him like we in Paris
Got me screamin out “ain’t no nigga like the one I got”
He always worried about who I fucked
He tryna say it’s me, myself, and I
Damn that made me a one eyed fuck
I was so mad, I use to ride the nigga like a moped
But playas fuck up, my bad, and just to keep from cryin, I laughed


When I said, it was over, I shot right through your heart
Why did I let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, you was so mad. I should’ve seen this comin right from the start
I should beware, beware, beware, of a nigga with a broken heart


Baby, last time callin you baby
Last time callin you crazy, crazy, crazy
Baby, last time callin you baby
Last time callin you crazy, crazy, crazy



Tell us that you would like to have the lyrics of this song. Then we'll make it our highest priority to find these lyrics first!



Ok I say that shit again, I said it once before

I glisten and shine with miss's fine model chick
Big behind, bad enough to skip the line
But to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double o you can call me Mr Bond
Bitch I am a monster I belong on district 9
Catch me in my office, office, doin business
The f*ck you doin? Bullshitttin
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arivin'
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran
I guess they on somthin cause my neck look like horizon
Just a million people behind me and I don't have verizon
Man I'm chillin with my niggas nigga
And a couple cool bitches
What the f*ck u doin? Bullshitttin
Me and my niggazzz say it ain't Ton
Hundred pretty girliess singin our songgg
Yea I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
And I be blowin on that reefer u can't say that it ain't strong and
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a conehead
When I'm done go ahead... what the f*ck this is? !
What the f*ck you doin? Bullshitttin
I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm lookin in the mirror
By the time ya'll over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time u ridin wat I'm ridin on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flyer miles is in the thousies I'm outtie
Somewhere chillin in Maui swimmin with the scuba fishes
Wat the f*ck you doin? Bullshitttin
Nigga I be splargin
I beg my pardon
Cause yalll niggas is starvin
Lookin for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yea I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be runnin through them trees niggas call me tarzan
Wat u think? we won't stop! gone stop?
Silly hoe I'm livin out my dreams don't you dare hit that alarm clock
I'm laid up with yo girlfriend u knockin like wat u doin nigga? !
I'm like f*ck YOU doin? ! Bullshitttin!
I hit you with an AMC, my nigga that's a full clip
And you could be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit



Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael hoe
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's because I got the title hoe
See I just want my fantasies and real life
You got everything to me what it feel like
Muthaf-ck the radio if I can't hear mine

They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'mma make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories

Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cuz in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
Thats what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great
How many missed calls before you considered fake
How many dreams before its considered fate
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"
I'm praying that he make, wished we could go back
Cuz honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...




Okay, I'm young and rich
And this the shit man
You you is a shit stain
Me I'm connected like I switch planes
Addicted to Weed bitches and big chains
Woop, car so big I crash it if I switch lanes
Sayin you the man nigga quit playin
How you winning if I ain't switch teams
Bitch I had the same dreams since I was sixteen
Ripping life out out of the plastic
Turning everything to platinum
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson
Me, earl mac and a bunch of Toni Braxton's
Fill your cup to full full fullest
Tone if they acting up then pu-pu-pull it
High off money we the p-p-pussy
I don't st-st-st-stutter
Go g-g-girl do it right now

This ain't nothing new to me
Addicted to the cars and jewelry
All the bad bitches like whoa it's he
Swear you know you know you know you know what I do
To me, do to me, do to me, do do
To me, do to me, do to me, do do
You know what I do
