Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture!
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation!
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

I'm goin' back in…

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna



I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say "choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like the asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will




Young Money! You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoke in the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
It ain't trickin' if you got it
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

Motherfucker, I'm ill

They say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me!
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me; I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up shit’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it

If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

I'mma blunt blowin', Polo drawers showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

I'mma blunt blowin', Polo drawers showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

I'mma blunt blowin', Polo drawers showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
It's Young Mula, baby



With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it

Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..

MJ taught me that
Take 'em to Mars, man

Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

Hey B.P., looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time?

So why are we, talking to each other again...




Kane is in the building

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first




I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone



Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy

I point it at you and tell that motherfucker "fetch"
I’m fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don’t sleep, so Weezy can’t rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

Big black nigga in a icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Count the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be hot, swish!
I’m swimming in a yellow bitch in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I’m the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected got killers off in Chicago

I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid, get ya head popped

200 thou' on a chain, I don’t need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E, five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga

You know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I died today it’d be a holiday

I’m not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don’t make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny mom her only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I’m Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It’s a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up

I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car



Man, fuck ya'll with a sick dick, Semi automatic no click click

Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch

In a hot spot cause a nigga never chillin'

Boy, I overgrind, overshine
Ain't another nigga over Sean
I'm getting paid, it's Oprah time
I’m rollin' pine, I’m so divine

Dark glasses on like I'm goin' blind
Looking like Eazy E, it’s just me and Lil Weezy-we
Get off my dick!

Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, yeah

Uh, my mind’s filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It’s Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today ?

Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe

Cut the music up
A little louder..

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love




She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "fuck you"

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches



You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing

Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shit and got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'mma need some fuckin goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop potato salad




Woo, this that shit they didn’t want me on
I’m ‘bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail,  I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu,  glory unto you, glory

I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga,  I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar,  I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private,  tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em



Look what you made me do
Me! That's who
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!
Woo, oh

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait too
I told myself to save yourself 'cause I can't save you
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Fuck it, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin' – I got Barbie, I got Drake too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Boop

Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army
And if them niggas coming for me, I'm going out like Tony
Now I don't want no problems, I just want my money
Ain't gotta hold no conversation, nor my luggage
Tell whoever's counting that I'm on a hundred
Woo, Birdman Junior – more like Ugly Duckling

Taking over, now I'm taking over, yeah
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinking forward, ta
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga
All I got is Young Money – no more Cash, nigga

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper – Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin', I just chipped my tooth
Tell them niggas – No love lost, 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself 'cause I can't save you
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through
Yeah

It's compensation over conversation
Lord I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces
Lord, this game is a vampire
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga
Got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'mma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down
Had to kick y'all out
Life is a movie
But sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

Taking over, Lord I'm taking over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you
You've been down since day one
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow
And to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit
Now I hate school

And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...




Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Like I, I feel big, you know?
Like not big in the sense of weight, you know what I mean?
Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that, like colossal
I heard you were lookin' for me

Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching

Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church", I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'ma leave it to
God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the Sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call them April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a parapleguc
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo and "Da-da-do"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy to Murcielago
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go

It's my go, yeah…
And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status-quo
Flow, so, pro
I know I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past!
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, baby!

Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve



Soulja Boy on the beat

Pussy monster in her closet, full of surprises

I hope that pussy warmer than luke and sweet as Godiva
Suck this dick and swallow that nut and call it Penis colada
Lift up that mini-skirt, that's my dinner desert
She fell in love with the Martian, I said you too down to Earth

But I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already
She say "Tunechi go slower" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor, my dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet

Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit, if I fucked a nigga then that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi, my pussy a safe place
Fuck me 'til daybreak, then you can go skate, Trina



Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did

But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good




Man, fuck these niggas!

Take the knife off the AK and cut these niggas
Yeah, and fuck these bitches
I swear I care about everything but these bitches
I don’t care, I "so what" these bitches
And I put Young Mula, baby, way above these bitches
If it ain’t broke, don’t break it
And if he ain’t shook, I’m gon' shake him
Hope I don’t look weak
Cause when a wolf cry wolf, you still see that wolf's teeth, mothafucka
Futuristic handgun
If you act foul, you get two shots and one
I'm at your face like Lancôme
You niggas softer than Roseanne's son
Hey, you cannot reach me on my Samsung
I'm busy fucking the world and giving the universe my damn tongue
Crazy motherfucker, I am one
But the crazy thing is, I began one
All white bricks, I’m straight like it’s jumping back to 36, nigga
Big house, long hallways, got 10 bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga

And we don’t want no problems
Ok, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street
Ughh, I pop that pussy

Swagger so bright, I don’t even need light
I’m with a model broad, she don’t even eat rice
But would you believe that she eat dykes?
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her 3 strikes
Yeah, I-I’m the man around this motherfucker
I’m so hot you probably catch a tan around this motherfucker
This rap game, I got my hand around this motherfucker
Yeah I said game, but I ain’t playing around this motherfucker
Yeah, I’m the best to ever do it, bitch
And you’re the best at never doing shit
If you the shit, then I am sewerage

Life is a gamble and I’m all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this?
I will make the most of this
'F' is for ferocious
Murder your associates
The top is so appropriate
This is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for your girlfriend to wobble on

And we don’t want no problems
Ok, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street
Ughh, I pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Oh Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby



I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble

When I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said "Whatever" cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers
Lord, she posted, she posted, she posted
They like it, they like it, repost it
She party promoting, she hosting
She posing, legs open, provoking
It got my head smoking
I tried to act like I don't notice
Emotions, emotions, emotions, lord

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

I had to leave that ho alone and get my mind right
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met her she was posse'd up
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh, she just want ten thousand followers

I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But Oh, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

I'm facing the bottle
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble




God bless america...
- Carter, are you prepared to take the constitutional oath?
- I am...
- Will you place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand and repeat after me, I...

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, *chuckles*
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter



My niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, "See, you gon' drink your life away"
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it
Anything we'll do for the paper
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don’t you try me
If you really gon' be dramatic, we gon' to need some music, they queuein' the violin
I'm talking slow singing, flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door



Remix
We fall asleep naked, we wake up naked
You know what that means, pussy for breakfast
And I know how she likes it, I'm a psychic
I eat it then I go back to sleep, that's that "itis"
And she be by herself she a loner
Trukfit, I'm the owner
I make her moan, call her Mona
I'd have a threesome if they cloned her
And me I'm purple kush forever
I'm purple drank forever
That dick make her feel retarded
She say I make her feel special
When I ain't thinking 'bout them other hoes
Ever since you put that pussy on me
I told her put that pussy on me right
And I'mma change your life
And don't sit on top of this dick if you're scared of heights

And shawty be like
This pussy for you
I ask her is it true? And she say like a horseshoe
She got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like "vroom"
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
And look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight
You need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid
She a plus, first aid
They ask me what’s her race and I say first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth but bitch I need my space
And she gon' ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give her Santa Clause face
We gon' turn up tonight

That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about her

She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like boom
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
Then look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight, you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid, she a plus, first aid
I put her in her place and that's first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
I ain't got no worries, no Frank Ocean I'm straight
Tunechi, tell 'em I'm straight
Tunechi
Haaa



No homo
I say he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper

Lollipop, lollipop, breasts is just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, "How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze?
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's nacho cheese."
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay."
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two-seats, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fuckin' with the best in the world
Lollipop, the best in the world

She lick me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in that Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo
Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps




Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5, since '05!
Know that!

You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass
Witchyo' fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'
Like a salad no dressing
Take ya to ya favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin'
Oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwaver oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like yo sister maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh isn't that sweet
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you

Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your asscrack
Lemme get back on track...
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like, "What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay that's a dead subject, you bring it up that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you

I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do



I ain't lookin' back, nigga
I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my draws but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone
And put one in your dome

One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itching, nigga'

I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
You ain't gon hurt nobody like Kid 'n Play
Ain't nothin' sweet but the codeine, nigga
Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights, make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick, I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'mma straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet, nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick nigga
One bitch on the whip, one on the phone
The one on the phone, is in front of ya home
She 'bout to run in ya home, and put one in ya dome

One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin'

Rest in peace to the game cause I'm fresh to death
Rest in peace to the game, tell 'em kill theyself
Make your deathwish, cause I'm too fresh
Cause I'm fresh to death, cause I'm fresh to death
You go broke tryna get fresh like this
Rest in peace to the game cause I killed it
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
What you talkin', I came out a coffin

I just can't see myself
Living in a house of mirrors
I bought me a double R
Cause I went from rags to riches
And these niggas nag like bitches
Actin' like little fags like Richard
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You got a problem
I can fix it like a mathematician
I am-munition
Call me ammo for short
Trukfit shirt, camo the shorts
Ya girl is a freak, ya man is a narc
With your son in your arms
I put one in your dome



Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such

She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off

Swimming trunks and bathing suits

Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up

Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line

We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you

She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplating short hair
She said she tryna be different, but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes, I'm hoeing, but she the only one worth knowing
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'ma dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, "Okay I'm your honor"
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass I just be like, "Come sit your groceries on my counter"
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine
Tunechi

Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need

I got that shit in my system
Somebody gonna be my victim
Eh, so where you at with it?
'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need an assistant
I got that good-good, that get right
That early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight
One, two, three, four, five, 69
That dick all in your windpipe
Some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright
Sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one
Don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue
My third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl
Can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me
My game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

"Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you"

Should I call somebody else?
'Cause, girl, it's almost twelve and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, eh, eh
Should I call somebody else?
Cuz girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself
Girl you know it need some help, it make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way
And she said

"Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need

Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shitting roses
We in the same picture, but we all got different poses
I’m looking in my rearview, I see the world in it
I try to slow down and I get rear-ended
Pause! Like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'mma shoot for par
I’m searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, like I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR
Blood like a scar
Weezy F Baby, and the 'F' ain't for flaw

It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch she will confirm it, yeah
Now where we going with it?
You keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuing with it
I know my shit already tight, so I ain't screwing with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me "Sir", call me "Survivor"

Uh, call me killer cause I make a killing
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly, like tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track, train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing, or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the 'F' is for "fuck yourself"

And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathing this air
And Mack’s mom told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m trying to stay aware
And if you want to trip, then I'mma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' ain’t for fear



Fuck nigga, them fuck niggas
My blunt bigger than these lil niggas
Keep stuntin' with your bitch ass
You'll get jacked and Jilled, nigga

Chopper knock your face off
Black shades, Ray Charles

I ain't working with a full deck
But I pull out that Ace card
She grab that dick with 2 hands
Like she about to pray for it
Clips hanging, no curfew
Fuck you and who birthed you

I'm bout it.. I said I'm about to cum
When I'm on the scene I'm on that lean
Bitch, I'm drowsy
Man, I'm so high I don't know what I'm laughing about
I got bars, nigga and it's happy hour!

Ridin' round with them choppas, not them ninas
Ridin' with a bitch named Molly and she on Molly - ha!
Man these niggas can't see me like a diary

Top of the gun there is a scope
I close one eye, I look like a pirate, fuck it!
TRUKFIT my bitch up, Tunechi leave big nuts

Just bought my girl a Ferrari Spider
Told her drive it like it got 8 legs
No pussy no rats, no Tom and Jerry
They say your friends are your enemies?
Well, my friends are imaginary
I'm the motherfuckin resolution like the 1st of January
My ride cold and my bitch hot
I'm tired as hell but my dick not
I don't gas no bitch, no pit-stop

Smoking on that sticky bag
Small feet, but I kick your ass

Eat that pussy like caviar
She treat that dick just like a straw
How you like them apples, Microsoft?
Now wipe it off..
Step off in that motherfucker fresher than some Certs
Uuh! Who the fuck is Stevie J?
I got the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your ass, kill your ass
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed
Just make sure my pillow's fluffed
Hit a nigga with a million shots
What you call that? A million bucks
Good weed, we pass around
It's Young Money, Cash Money
Til the motherfuckin day I'm Cashin Out!
Tunechi!

Riding round with them choppas, not them ninas
Your bitch wanna come over here where the grass is greener
And if you passing that weed, I'm the wide receiver

Got me coughin' like I'm getting buried
I've been fucking Mary-Jane
I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger
I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back
And keep blinking like hazards
I said king me, king me
With my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs
My cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse
What I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard
Bitch look up at my points

Styrofoam cups and wine glasses
Shot glasses
Hot flashes

Tryna' get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gona' smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes nigga

Weed, pills, and that drank
Thats my trippy kit
Thats my trippy kit

She lay down and say "Let's make a film"
I be like "Action"
I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first
You'll get your family killed
That's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range
Hold that gun like the photographer hold the camera still

They both look at me, say "Shut up"
I say "My lips are sealed..."
Oooh

Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure

Oh yes I love her like...

Oh yes I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description?
Her body's sickenin'
I can be her prescription
I can be her physician
Sexual healing
I can be her religion
And now she's kneeling
Praying to the ceiling
I bless her
As if she sneezed
Must be the weather
I dress her
I am her sleeves
I am her feathers
She's fly, flyer than you
Flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love her three –
Times more than her mom
Time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should
We should
Be wherever she wanna be
On a late night, midday, AM
Just say when
And I know I be with cavemen
But nevermind them
She's Poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know that y'all don't hear me
But she does
We does
What grown folk do
When they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had to much too drink, and

Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

Oh yes, I love her like I oughta
I see you at the altar
Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son
More than one
Maybe Five, like the Jacksons
Or John Paxson
Just don't let em fuck up the mansion
And daddy will be home
Later on
Smellin' like the cologne
That I put on
This morn
And I hope
That you smell like woman's soap
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles
And I'mma run through that pussy like a vandal
Yes, I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweatin' out a fever
Leave her
To me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear-to-ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated
Panties are debated
Einstein; her head is the greatest

Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man
Would ever love her
Oh, and
I better be the only man
Stickin' it
Lickin' it like an envelope
Mailin' it, sealin' it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret
Don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody
Not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it
That ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station
We have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them Orient Asians
I do me
I say, "Hey Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty
Roll, like sushi"
I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
"Ahs", "Ooh-wees"
"Voilas", "Tah-das"
"Mhmms", "Uhh-huhs"
"Oh-yeahs", never "Oh-nos"
Until I have to go
I tell her, "Don't cry
I be back like the electric bill"
And when she's butt-naked, she's dressed to kill



Tell me something I don't know
I'm flexing on 'em like torsos
These niggas slipping like bar soap
These niggas listening, use Morse code
Boy, nigga sipping like parched throat
Ahe-he-hem, excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in
Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a little blurry, but
It's staying on my quota
And we find out Mom's address
And your head get mailed over
Nigga, you make that bed, you lay in that bed
Or get that bitch made over
Tunechi

You so crazy
Tunechi, you so crazy
Bitch, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say "Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, you so crazy"
Bitch

Tell me something I don’t know
I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money, drugs, bitches, guns
Niggas call me "Mucho"
Got witches all in my broom closet
Got little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out your business hours
And pop up like new toast
Like, danger taste like glucose
My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes, "Kudos"
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns
Nigga you crazy

You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me

Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

You so crazy
Tunechi - you so crazy. Bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch

Tell me somethin I don’t know
Like what happened to hard coke?
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancerwith a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit, or my balance
Lil Tunechi

Stand up niggas



When this shit dropped I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing - big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
5 dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
13′s on the whip, kept my shit clean
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m driving round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game, but I got a lot of lip
Thats why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth, most likely
I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I’m gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet cause her momma always home
God damn, Lord have mercy
Please God don’t let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I’ll pass, y’all Utah Jazz-in'
And ya’ll borin’, I don’t play nigga, I’m Mark Madsen
Thats why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I’m not asking my nigga I don’t need favors
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger
Team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger

Swimmin' laps around a bottle of
Louis the XIII
Jumping off of a mountain
Into a sea of Codeine
I'm at the top of the top
But still I climb
And if I should ever fall
The ground will then turn to wine
Pop-pop, pop-pop
I feel like flying
Then I feel like frying

Only once the drugs are done
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying

I can mingle with the stars
And throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner
Locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane
Without a pilot
And violets
Are blue
Roses are red
Daisies are yellow
The flowers are dead
I wish I could give you this feeling
That I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more

Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

The big 3 on the court, bitch at them bleachers
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread dissin' Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin' pills, but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switched flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the bitch is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run

Quiet dawg, my phone changed up

Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit
Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game
And y'all chump change

I got animal all in my flo'
Take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitch's lies, nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store
My nigga's like Kanye with that good
My nigga's like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas be sayin' they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw yo' bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know
Nigga's be trippin' over these ho's, I done came too far to get close
I've been outchea gettin' bread, and I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat
Nigga's be lukewarm at the most
And when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mack
Gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome
But it'd be on a tombstone if I wrote
Tunechi

My kids already rich and they don't even know
These nigga's sayin' they playa's, they ain't even scored
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga
My cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no long letters
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these ho's ain't got no job
And these nigga's goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Dick harder than a armadilla'
MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my nigga's
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot
Let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life
All I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour
Twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME
T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these nigga's been dead
Uh, I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know

Don't fuck with these fuck nigga's, you already know us
I'm looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise
Yeah
Pass that weed to the next nigga
Blunt longer than a tongue twista
Ho's want this scud missile

Lil Tunchi Li, young sex pistol
New money, no wrinkles

Dedication Cinco

What up 5?
Rocko fuck with me!

T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these nigga's been dead



I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue


Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared


And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there




I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah, nah
And I'm laughing at them pussy niggas

For them dead presidents, we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work
So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they worthless

Man, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh

And if niggas think it's a game
I'll leave they brains on their jerseys

She say she love me, that's the molly talking
She about to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby

On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving, game tight like virgins

You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie
Wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking- lets get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises

Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping, my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain

She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains

Fuck is up?
Beat him up
Like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up
For the fuck

You can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle
Or a ladder that's forever
However
I'm better
If not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips
Unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch
Swallow my words
Taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty
Spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic
Abracadabra

Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crack house
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout

Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work
Said "I know it stank but it's good"
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'

Uh, and I'm about to smoke one, pass out, OG kush, hashed out
She only want alcohol and trees, fuck that, you gotta branch out
I camp out by a rat house, wait 'till he turn the lamp out
Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas look like y'all swam out
In this bitch, gats out in this bitch
She say she can come and help my fat wallet get fit
I told her that's not in this script, I don't see that in the script

Up up and away

I'm about to go, up up and away
Dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Pussy, umh? How sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy bitch, I'm deep into space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake
I'm gone like, delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'mma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Umh, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out
Cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I bust in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

You're going a little bit too far

Ain't this a bitch
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away



Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps on deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you looking like lightning struck that nigga
Racks on deck, I'm rich as shit

Walking around on my fuck it shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm Superbad
I don't give a Hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggas
They should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes, I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

Weezy, where ya going?




Ahem
Weezy F
Young Money
Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3
Ladies and Gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

You know I ride
For my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die
With my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high
And I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler
And I'd rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide
As it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it
If she steal it I'mma kill her
I bulletproof the ride
Now I feel like armadillas
And fuck your hospital
Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie
When I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty
Like C Y Phyllis
Self-made G
And them bitches know the business
Relying on rap
But in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five
My favorite movie was the Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this
But I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine
And a little intervention
And them birds don't fly
Without my permission
I'm probably in the sky
Flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean
Swimming with the pigeons
See my World is Different
Like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble
Bitch, I want the same thang

And you know that I’m gon' ride
With my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die
With my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry bout mine
I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas
That the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas
That the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high
You'll see that I’m gonna be in it
The sky is the limit

Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea
By any means
And you're just sardines
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my Prps
What do you expect
I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours

And I'mma ride
With my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die
With my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine
I'mma grind til I get it
And tell all of my niggas
That the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And I'mma tell all of my niggas
That the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look up high
You'll see that I'm gon be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house
And shoot everyone that's sitting on the living room sofa
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the street

So you know that I'mma ride
With my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die
With my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine
I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas
That the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine
I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas
That the sky is the limit

Because the sky is the limit
Yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look high
You'll see that I'm gonna be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me don't get high
And I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler
And I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air
Because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there?
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man
The Sky Is The Limit

Your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest
But her boobs too big

On a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said "Soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They gon' have to give they styles back"
I said "You too cray"
She said "You too humble"
I said "You too, bae"
She said "You too sweet"
Then I ask her do she go both ways
She say "They do say love is a two way street"
I say "Oooh"
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to mee
Treat that girl like cuisine
She gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum

Never knees in the dirt
Never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees

Tune, I heard you don't sleep
I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak
For that purple, that pink
Yeah you see what I'm saying
Like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease
I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets
Since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats
I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with
She working for me
I personally
Get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers
I'm at peace
Word
I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek
I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money
Time served and released
But this agent ain't free
Word
That's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news
That shit's so yesterweek
I'm just focused
Focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi, you good?"
I'm like "Bob, yessiree!"
Now don't, I mean don't
Don't question me
Let me breathe
Dog, big dog
I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long – Tree trunk
Now stand under me
Catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees
But repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch
Your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on my balcony
We watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit
She gonna need lube for this
Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world
She like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord
I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin self
'You only live twice, slime'
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry
She say "Don't be sorry"
Then she say "Don't apologize for shit
Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit"
Woah

Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter

Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big headed my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi

I might book me for a show
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures
I like math, all I did was add bitches
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic, plus I named my pistols
Last name Fuck, first name I Don't Give A
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure

All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss....I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
Cuz I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missle
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you

Weed and syrup, yeah

All I know is paper
I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap
And pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon
It's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy
Keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind
And bodies on my nine
And I swear everyday
I'm on my Ariana grind
I got that yay
I got that ladidadida
And a kamikaze squad
And you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man
Like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove
Turnin' O's
To octagons
I get money while I'm sleep
I dream that I'm in heaven
I dreamed I saw Lil Beezy
And smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, Rest In Peace
And my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep
They catch him
When he least expect 'em
Momma told me
"If you run these streets
Run these streets correctly"
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows
I wear new clothes
To the mall
Two hoes
On my arm
Fur boots
When it's warm
Church shoes
To play ball
We spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper
I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you
Neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him
Better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy, cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zero's
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord all I know is paper
Big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is
That bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience
'Til I heard all aboard
They mad cause I be skatin'
At home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5k
I be spendin' 25k every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London
Y'all don't hear me


Hol' up
Had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up
Roll some more up
Watch me go up
My doors go up
When I show up
Why you show up?
Pick my bro up
Pick a O up
Hit the store up
Get a soda
Get us 4 cups
Split a 4 up
Then we slow up
Yeah you know us
Then we toast cups
And we post up
Don't approach us
We got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust
Give no fucks
Take no stuff
And take your stuff
Then ho hunt
For some chocha
I know a ho
Who'll rock the boat
But I row her
I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita
I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres
Oh Lord
I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms
He died recent
So I hope heaven made more room for him
And I hope he see me
Cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy
Oh Lord

You should see my 11 year old daughter do they dance

Man, I'd rather chill with 54 bitches
Chill like, ch-chill like an Eskimo, let's get mo', let's get mo' bitches
And I be like "Let's get mo' bitches"
Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop lettin' the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney

At a T-I-M-E
Why when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay run to us
And payday comes sooner than later round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mack, and Nina debate around there
Yeah, you see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wanna be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now I'm right back in it like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten my girl be a twenty
My girls so bad make a nigga think he's sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies

Mic check, two, three, I am different like blue pee
And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been ridin'
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stuntin', but no, I'm just survivin'
And I’ve been here, but my soul is just arrivin'
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribin'
Medication free, and for meditation we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P, as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that, so I got my guns
Let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammies back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga's woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist the God to these Evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami though

Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But heaven or hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'mma go
Take a nigga's gal and make her come give me a private show
Still long hair, don't care like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse and I swag and surf
No ceilings



Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggas keep tripping they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands
My gang popping niggas

Now eat these fucking bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
Dress like a skater, ride on you like Shaun White
I'm high all day, you can call that shit a long flight
Every night's a long night, every day's a holiday
I don't fuck with squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yeah I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the diamond face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war
Then tell them motherfuckers "Bombs away"

Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating

I'm in the crib butt naked, bitch
She said my dick could be the next black president
Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Uh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being, Part II
Getting paid, show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick, carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Uh, whatcha man doing?
I pop his muthafucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man and mine talks lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y, my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half pipe
She say, "Tunechi, you the shit, you need your ass wiped"
I say, "Before you gas me up, check the gas price"
Then I make her take this dick, like advice
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait, you ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the mutherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet, Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you-uh?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
90 billion bitches on my stick like a skewer
That's swag, I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going propane
Bitch get off me, bitch get off me
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer B's, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers
It's so strange, but this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head, what's that? A no-brainer
Plain old nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I rather ring ya fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass, get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer, or warm air
Man, nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano
Nigga



Dana texted me and said she wanted to see me
Then sent a picture of her in the mirror
No clothes on, of course and she want that dope dick
Hello, world, I'm the dope dealer
I love it when she talk crazy
That dick make her walk crazy
That last time was awesome
All the lines we crossed them
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I OJ Simpsoned that pussy
That's the shit
Pussy taste so good make you smack your lips
I don't know about you, but I'm a beast with mine
She said she wait for the Carter to 69
I told her "Sorry 4 The Wait"
I value her time like an Audemars-Piguet
And we gonna stay current like the water in the lake
Yeah, we fuck around like we fucking in a circle
Pardon the slur, that's the purple
It feels so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal
Yeah that's my bitch
Pussy wetter than a wishing well, I wish
I was in it right now instead of making this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see ya
And she say she working on her career
Smoke got our eyes looking like we from Korea
We floating but I'mma rock the boat like Aaliyah
RIP, shorty got me
Shorty knows I fuck her with her hard body
Shorty fine by me, Spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know it's on your mind, fine, we can do
Whatever that is
She tell me that it's mine
I said fine
Shit, I was taught to live and let live
So live it up baby, giddy-up baby
It's your world, ain't trying to interrupt
But maybe we moving too fast
But fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now I feel lovely, I feel great
Yeah, all that good shit
No I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit
And I know what I'm doing
She loves how I do it, she throw that ass back and she never over-do it
She call me "baby" and I call her "bae"
Sorry for the wait
Carter 4 on the way! August 29th...



No Ceilings

Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President got 'em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it say 'Right now'
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial

And I got so much swag I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it global warming
If we gon' do it, dog, let's do it now
I am more animal than the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas little league, call 'em Curaçao
Energizer money, it keep going
I’m laid up, I’m free throwing
Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your Missus
You are local news, I’m 60 Minutes
I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office, guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses, keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the 'F' is for 'Forensics'
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
OK, you're doing your thang, well, things change
You Plain Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise, where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies

It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time-ticker
I’m always strapped, Vietnam, nigga
We are fine, nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball, nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes, I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
It's Young Money, baby, and the building grows
As we look up, where did the ceilings go?
No Ceilings



I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you

Pain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me
Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
But I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tellin' me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster .. BANG!

You've been hiding, never letting it show
But there is something that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back

And your well on your way to the top

But I hope you haven't forgot about me
Up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me "Butta", I called you "Bae"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream .. DAMN!

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart



Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Fuck up my dream, somebody gon' die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'
Aye, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'
You can get the fuckin' Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I am the best—and no, I ain't positive, I'm definite
I know the game like I'm reffin' it
This is Tha Carter, Tha Carter 3, the New Testament
And I'm the God, and this is what I bless 'em with

Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
Yeah, Junior

It's Cash Money over everythang
It's in my blood, I feel it runnin' in every vein
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like a Scud
What's really good, I'm 'bout that ruckus like Fudd
And I stayed on my flo' at Cash Money, like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million-heir to the throne
Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb
Young Money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take a dasher as the Lord is my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire

Last year they had the Grammy's and left me in Miami

I'm rappin' when you sleep
I was rappin' when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, book 'em, Danny
I'm a monster, I tell you, Monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the House of Pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck with me, I will peel like the house's paint—let's go!
Niggas don't wanna see me ‘cause I'm better in bold
The only time I will depend is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
‘Cause I'm so sick and tired of shittin' on everybody else
I try to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And now nothin' gonna stop me, so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit, ha ha

Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire, bitch!

Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man

She said I had the right, to remain silent
Now I got her hollering, sounding like a siren
And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss

And all she want me to do is fuck the police

Hands so big, you thought I told, "Pull it over"
She pulled me over, pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer, do me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs, start ripping my pants off

We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang

Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head

I wanna do it all night long, Mrs. Officer

When I get up all in ya

We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang

I bet my life when we gamble
Y'all shippin' keys, we shippin' grand pianos
I'm in that Lam Diablo
Pew, like ammo
I'm gone
Two fingers up, bitch, I'm gone
Rich forever – Jerry Jones
I gotta hustle, keepin' my destiny goin'
Like the House of Deréon
This plane that I'm on
Is private, my very own
So no checkin' my carry-ons
She sent a picture naked, I said "It's on"

But she live in Fort Lauderdale
And I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over
She said "OK, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife
And keep my house clean
I say shut the fuck up
Put this dick back in your mouth please
I don’t see nothing wrong with
Some mouth and lip service
Tunechi motherfucker
Tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch

My new Nina just told me
That she sick of being a virgin

Now I don't get excited
Nigga, I just get exotic
I don't get invited
To these bitches pity parties
I don't do narcotic
Even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money
I feel like I got arthritis
Baggin' up the work
For a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help
Before they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait
The confusion, the disturbance
Boy we movin' weight
Prostitution, and these verses
Whippin in the kitchen
In the trap house with my shirt off
I'm gon' get these millions
And I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin'
Talking 'bout the third ward
The DA was a dick
And the Judge was a jerk off

We yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Yeah, you hear us yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Blood gang, nigga
And it's that Sorry 4 the Wait 2, woo

These bitches ain't got no manners
These niggas ain't got no standards
My bitch ain't got no love handles
Boy, I'm clippin that toe on that camel
I got bitches that'll kill for me – Charles Manson
Suck this thuggish ruggish bone, swallow that bone marrow

Homeboys be cutthroat

But Tunechi bigger than Elvis Presley
Young Money was my best investment
Goin' harder than my predecessor

Lil Tunechi comin back like Kobe
Niggas stab me in the back, I owe 'em
Got a house in the hills
Now a nigga gotta deal
With mountain lions and coyotes
Semi, I keep that semi
And friendly, I can't be friendly
Freckles, them bullet holes look like freckles
You look like Wendy's
House in the hills jumpin like Jordan

A young nigga startin to feel cornered
My LA house jumpin like Jordan
My Miami house jumpin like Jordan
Can't forget about my house in New Orleans
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
I want my new bitch titties enormous
With a backyard and a pretty garden
With a pussy more pink than a orchid
Young nigga gonna treat it like a florist

Cause wifey get money like Kimora
I got a fine bitch feelin exhausted
Cause I'mma put this dick on her til tomorrow
I'mma pull up on a bitch in a Gallardo
Then I'mma take the top off like a barber
I go down and kiss her Pearl Harbor
She's so down with this New World Order
Fuck the shit out her in a sauna
Sweat her hair out, she look like Al Sharpton
Got a goon named Fernando
At the front door your condo

Bad bitch with a nice throat
She ice cold and she like hoes
Ooh, she just my type
These other hoes just typos
Young nigga coming back like Jordan

Young nigga drank lean like water
Young nigga smoke weed like Marley
Young nigga on the Moon like Warren
Young nigga on this shit like Charmin

Fall asleep in the pussy, good lordy
Woke up in a new Bugatti, good mornin
Young nigga got guns, good luck
Nina Ross say "Me so horny"
Lil Tunechi, at the top it's so lonely
Got fat pockets, never bony
I'm with a model bitch, she so bony
I done shook shit up, it's so foamy
I just cooked this up, it's still hot
You could still smell the kitchen on me
Nigga I'll have your homies
Singin "Damn I miss my homie"
I got a mountain of weed
I got a mountain of cash
I got mountains like Wyoming
I got a bad bitch and she foreign
She always mad with me, I'm sorry
She say "Damn why you can’t call me?"
"Cause they be taxin for that roamin"
She a tan bitch, she orange
I can’t stand a snitchin informant
Niggas cooked crack on a Foreman
While y'all boys was still sparrin, uhh
This that Sorry for the Wait 2
Tell the dead homies you pray to
You on your way too
That the truth is hard to swallow
You got fake juice
Even Slick Rick the ruler know I break rules, ooh
Got the gas out shootin like Jordan
I'll put your homeboy face on a T-shirt
And put your own face on a milk carton
Busy, I’ve been so busy
Ain’t even got time for quickies
That’s why my bitch been so bitchy
I’m outchea tryin' to get me
I’m coming back out jumpin like Jordan
I’m so sorry for the wait, I’m tardy
I wrote a letter to my competition
Hippie, I be so trippy
Give her pussy a hicky
I hope she ain’t strictly dickly
So we can menage to Nicki, ooh




Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with PA so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps no holding back, let's go!

Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain’t gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain’t gon' fight
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' “there he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with tha Carter IV



See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it

See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder

That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind


Uh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip when she like that dick
Ooh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip don't fight that dick girl, girl
Fucking with you, well, I'ma need another shower
I'ma need another shower
Can you help me take another shower?
Then we gonna make each other shout

There's steam in the air, fog everywhere
She can get her hair wet cause it's her real hair
I be like, "Hell Yeah"
And she be like, "Fucking right"
Now she got one leg in the air, I'm pulling on her hair
And she say I can pull it, cause it's her real hair
She be like, "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah" cause I fuck her right


Then I said, "See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward"



Sorry for the wait man
Album coming August 29th now
Time to let me do this thing

Ain’t nobody fucking with me
First degree murder, you can get your degree, motherfucker
And you ain’t gotta wonder about me, Wonder Woman
Tune gonna ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan
Real nigga shit, pussy niggas gonna hate
Pound of the kush, call that bitch "pound cake"
I hit it from the back and make that bitch about face
And then I gotta split, sorry baby, sour grapes
She whine, baby don't leave
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave
Everybody trippin', but I ain’t never trippin'
Leave your ass flatter than my new television
I'm talking 'bout money and the power, power and the money
I'mma run this shit 'til I'm the last man runnin
Mack light that shit, then pass that to me
Young Money motherfucker yeah we the shit
Yeah Weezy go hard like Cialis
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho
She pop X, I smoke O’s, tic-tac-toe
And I stink cause I got a lot of shit on my mind
They say numbers don't lie, is that a 6 or a 9?
I stand in front of the clock cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off and send your head to your Mom
I ain’t playing with niggas, no sir not me
And they can’t blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah, I was locked up, but like a bird I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello, goodbye, where are you Wayne?
I’m somewhere in between joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now ain’t that about a bitch? It ain’t never about a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some knee pads nigga
Eagle street where the real niggas hung
I'ma rep that shit 'til Kingdom come
Yeah Short brang the drank, I bring the blunts
Fucking with me its blood, brains or guts

Fuck y'all for real though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I’m done peel off like velcro
Gone, baby I'm stoned
Smoking on the strong, got a huge ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can’t use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
One time for the G’s
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P’s and Q’s
Put your bitch ass on the evening news
Jumping in the game better read the rules
High as a bitch yeah thats me on the moon
Fuck with me die soon, not late
And I'm sorry for the motherfucking wait, Tunechi!



Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery
One me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil bitches
I don’t understand this shit, Like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet uh
Skatin on em like I’m Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb I can’t feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain
Drop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it’s nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that’s E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they’ll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back
I’mma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don’t really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that’s a cherry on top
You don’t wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that’ll die uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I’m about to brainstorm
Lil nigga I’ll take yo main ho, make her call her homegirl, make em share the same dick
It’s that motherfuckin Dedication 5, I just hope I’ll be alive to see a Dedication 6
Lil Tunechi

Ayo it’s levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Been doing MIA since Levels was the shit
And niggas know I’m on another level with this shit
I’m pedaling the 6, full metal when it hit
All I need is a shovel and a ditch
You done dig me a hole then you show me where it is
Run in his home and show me where the kids
Put one in his dome while he going in his fridge
That’s me, him nigga
Black piece AP, gold trim nigga
Black jeans, grey tee, old Tim’s nigga
Backstreet, everything go for 10 nigga
Keep quiet, beef we deep fry it
I’m in the streets like Rodney King’s riots
Mommy opposed their lead tight
On that old bullshit, Pete Myers
They scream and seize fire
My audible like Godfather meets Wire
A felon in the whip
Rollin 3 6’s, devil on trips
Shots whistled like a kettle when it’s lit
I’m tryin to go ballistic, shadow in the ship
Call the Barney Rubble in the whip
Made her kick rocks, blow haze from ziplocks uh



Microphone check, I still don't hear my...
Oh yeah I do, yeah I do
Who the fuck is Stevie J?

Don't be lookin' for no donations
You get dick, then reservations
I get pussy then hibernation
I start humpin' soon as I wake up
I woke up in some new punani
He woke up bleedin' like "who shot me?"
I kept shootin'; Boo said "you got 'em"
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of the body
But anyway I woke up in some new punani

I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk key can fit
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candle stick
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Got some shit built up I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
The TEC on my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Hold up, all bullshit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
Pussy feel like vacation
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'
Give her to Fuke if she Caucasian
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
I used to be at them Heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Don't stop, pop that don't stop
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi

Sippin' on dumb, puffin' a J
Met her tonight, fuck her today
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face
Wine head, she's guzzling grapes
Back shots, I'm holding her waist
Freaky, I always freak...
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her
Hater niggas be hungry
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em
Her panties are down, her legs is up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they mad, I told they was
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She's suckin' me off, I'm pokin' her brain
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing
That pussy so wet, I'm calling it rain
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
Most women front, but who do you blame?
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy
It's safe to say it's an even exchange...
Bitch!

Don't be givin' out information
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expectations
You know this is the Dedication
I'm on that kush she on that molly
I turn that pussy to Dasani
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi
I don't know this ho
So I must dash, no disguises
Tunechi, I had to Dedication 5 it



Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'mma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick her flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

Damn you the shit
And I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby, with you and only you

I say damn I must be left
Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

Damn you the shit
And I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby, with you and only you

Now she don't know about me but I'mma put her on it
And she ain't sure up out me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair her could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

Damn you the shit
And I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby, with you and only you




It's all good when we're making love

I got old money, take a bath in hundreds
My way or the highway and I see traffic comin'
It's Tunechi in this ho, watch them hoes go crazy
Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious
And I got news for all these snitches, tell them feds stop bitching
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whisperin'
You know life is so uncertain and death is so unwanted
My navigation system say it's death around the corner
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank
And Sosa alright, but I'm tryin' to meet Frank
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints
You'll be Batman and I'll be robbin' the bank
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power trippin'
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm livin'
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age
Ain't no such thing as too paid

Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho
Shake that ass ho

When we throw a pool party, we put sharks in the pool
I got Bloods in the cut, so don't throw salt in the wound
AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons
Better call the platoon
If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich I go pour
Champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit
Full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave


Whattup five
Take that coke to the stove
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass ho



And if I fuck her, she gon' get attached
Who invited all these fuck-niggas?
Man, shit ain't ever smell this good
Why them snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these niggas, wake me up when it's all over

Bitch, come kill my time, but bitch don't steal my shine
I'm cooking up two quarters, bout' to get rich or die tryin'
I got some killer's on my side, some kill up in my swisher
All this hatin' drive me crazy, take the key out the ignition
Oh my god it feel like Coogi weather
I lost my mind, but I got it back like groovy Stella
Tell them hoes I got that Victoria Secret weapon
I hope you live a double life cause you gon' need an extra
Me and my niggas we got bad bitches up in the pool
Bad bitches up in the pool
She gon' learn tonight, call that shit night school
And life is a bitch on her cycle, delightful
Got ho's on that powder, like light blue
Nice move, now king me nigga
Badass bitch, you seen me with her, we on that
GT Vodka, straight out the bottle, genie nigga
The difference between me and these niggas, is
I go hard and they go wrong
She say, "Hit it from the back," I'm tryin' to leave that crack alone baby

And if she love me, I'mma love her back
Who indictin' all the tough niggas?
We smoke that skunk that's always smellin' good
But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these nigga's, wake me up when it's all over

Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards
Let 'em know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it
Real nigga to the bone, bristle
Cocaine, like co cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan
I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's ho-in'
And all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin'
Hate a ho-nigga, like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing
That pussy feel like a pot of gold
The money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader
Got those ho's on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth
And ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mind reader
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-
Hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space
Guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield

And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back
She alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over

What up 5?



New chapter, move on, look back for what?

Ain't afraid to die, I done done it already
All that money on your mind I done spun it already
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already, yeah
Pussy, money, weed was the subject already
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it
For my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics
See its TTG, trained to go, time to grind, no more CMB
Excuse my French, but you know where you can mwah, yeah
Excuse my Spanish, but its no más
I been working hard for no prize
But I'm still grateful though I show pride
And you don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
They can't put no more Weezy Baby out
That's that Cash Money vasectomy
I still got love for my enemy
Cause I know its tough to be interesting

Them niggas never see me sweat
And tell the press I'm not depressed, I just had to press reset
I just had to get me set, and I'm not playin' skip recess
I'm a different Weezy, and I'm drippin' Fiji
In a Lamborghini with the seats wet
Hardest lesson is regret
Snorting powder on the P jet
Ask the pilot are we there yet
He said we on the ground, and we ain't leave yet
Had to step back and take a deep breath
It's hard as heck to show 'em respect
I love 'em to death but they ain't dead yet
Don't know how long I'm able to repeat that
Me I'm just tryin' to see the bread stretch
These niggas tryna see dread stress
Me, I'm just tryin' to see the dead rest
And I can't rest if I ain't pray yet

Father forgive them for their wrongdoings
For they do not know what they are doing, Amen

Ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah
TTG, trained to go, time to get it
Bitch I ain't afraid to die, I done done it already

And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
And I still got love for my enemy
Cause I know its tough to be interesting
Cause I know its tough to be anything, but be grateful

Can't lie we blessed, safe deposit box where I hide the check
Wear a hockey jersey just to hide the vest
I talked to God he deny the stress
I make women cry when they next to me
They say they blessed to be next to me
Give my kids my heart, put my mind in my music
And I let them hoes get the rest of me
Can't let this cold world get the best of me
Got the recipe for my destiny
Yeah I want them mills like Stephanie
Want the blue face hundreds preferably
This is the bounce back this is God's work
This is hard work, this is our work
This is all night graveyard work
Man this beat is godly
So I'm takin' off like a screechin' Harley
Watch the women wave cause I'm freakin' gnarly
Percs and purp got me sleepin' calmly
So I wake up and I chase the check
'Cause we ain't promised life, but we promised death
But we gon win, and I promise that
Young Money Records, you should honor that
And my vicious city got respect for me
Got killas to get at yo neck for me
You get the best of me, until the death of me
And the second me gon be the better me
Be grateful

Ain't afraid to die, I done it already
All that money on your mind I done done it already
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already
Pussy money weed was the subject already
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it

Carterfornia, Tune
Yeah, it sound like that 'Lil' man
That be, like, Wayne
Right over there
That nigga's from another planet—insanity
Shit, niggas from this planet ain't safe

Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'mma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost when I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Doing nothing but mothers stacking pussy coffin again
What is happening is a merger
Different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cook it and I'mma serve her
Further when I'mma get doing this - remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all, and I heard her
Thank you, Baby, for what became Lil Wayne
It's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
When they be bussing 'nough
They thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up
You in the gang, you bang
You drunk and touching every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Baller nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo business

Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, "All those flows are borrowed"
It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo
Lookin’ at stars so bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
A whole carload of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart E-
-nough to call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones?
Well tonight then, we gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head
And I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead, out

Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo
Lil Marly G and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling, it's bottomless
If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a Queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Junior forever
I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like "Un momento"
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say "Ooh, I like your cologne"
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never befo'
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga

Was busy, searching my calendar for better days
I found 'em, you either turn the page or tear the page

Back against the wall, and my two feet is what I stand on
Diva in the room, she blowing me just like a band horn
Got her on her knees, the same knees that she be praying on
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital "You can join"

With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station
I am tryna figure out why you so mad at me
Yes, I’m with Young Money, tell the magazine stop asking me
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head
And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery
I be with your baby mama, you be with your child at home
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone
Us against the world, better pick which fucking side you on
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on
And we about to kill 'em, C4, Mr. Carter's home

Yeah, I call it how I see ya
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn’t wanna be ya

I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A 2 dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'mma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter

I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian
Or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I said shorty, you a beast

I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s

She so flexible, we try angles like Bermuda
And the V is for Vanessa, voluptuous Vanessa
The W's for Winter, I'm under the weather
And the X is for my exes, fuck them altogether
The Y is for Yolanda and the Z is for Zelda

And these are my alphabet bitches
These are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
These are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
I swear to drunk I'm not God, yeah
Drops microphone, I swear to God I'm not God, oh
Drops microphone, I'd rather park and not drive, yeah
Drops Styrofoam, I can't talk, I might cry, yeah

I say, I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check that other nigga for that Louis shopping spree shit
Not me, bitch, no, you won't rob me bitch, no
I said, I be on some G shit, I be on some B shit
When it comes to bitches I be on some A-to-Z shit
I'm me, bitch, this shit like ABC, 123, bitch
To me, bitch, I'm the alpha, the alpha D-O-G, bitch
S-R-Y for the W-A-I-T, bitch



When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us
Love only lasts if my heart races on
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea, on
I'm racing on, yea
My heart races on

I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die
The angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, Momma hate I got my Daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my Daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him
The revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized

When this world comes crashing
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
My heart races on

Tunechi, you an angel
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

When this world comes crashing
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea
If you catch a feather just keep it)
My heart races on

This morning I woke up on my good side
Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from
The police, 'cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run
I keep my feet above the ground
We gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat-beat-beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile
I see no finish line – On your mark, set, pow



Y'all don't want no problems up in here
These niggas wear dresses and y'all call me weird nigga?
Go in niggas' pockets while we here
What kind of cologne do you wear because all I could smell is fear nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Boy I'm from New Orleans where the dope fiends kill niggas
Brains came out his fucking ear
I got a full clip, I empty the whole thing up in here
Now I'mma keep a pill and a blunt
I might pass the motherfucker but most likely I'mma flunk
Tell my bitch I could do bad on my own
She say "You gon' miss me nigga." I say "Bitch the thrill is gone"
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the MOB, man you niggas just some bridesmaids
Bitches give me head instead of playing mind games
Tattooed tears for my homies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom P bottle to your face
Niggas just construction workers, trynna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your bitch blowing me up? If I answer, I deflate
Motherfucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
I fuck her 'til she cry, make that ho drink her fuckin' tears
Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears
Then her homegirl came in the room and volunteered
Man, dreads hanging out the ski mask
Run up in your house, the couch potatoes getting mashed
Run up in the kitchen get your stash out the oven
You wonder how we know? stop talking while you cuddlin'
Ain't nothing like some pussy when you going through something
Just called a bad bitch, I said I'm going through something
Bugatti sitting still, look like it's going 200
Pussy nigga keep your mouth closed like you chew onions
Mother fucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Rather be judged by my jewelry, not a jury of my peers
And I got some kush to hide in her brassiere
And we only selling what the boat bring here nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Cause I got shooters on the roof like some fucking reindeer
And I'm probably with the model of the year
I'm about to go Pac with the nose ring up in here
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Young Money motherfucking Entertainment
And y'all know Marley got the chopper up in here
Yeah, me, myself and I, the fucking Three Musketeers
Smoke like I fucking disappeared
I check your pussy ass, and wait for it to clear nigga
Tunechi, everybody know your name like Cheers, nigga
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga!
Tunechi!

Yeah, D5
Whatup Five?
Worry bout me, give a fuck about you
Just as a reminder to myself
Bust every single nut in her motherfucking mouth
I'm like, Lord I hope she swallow more than tears...



Wheres my coffee?
Good morning Dr. Carter
Hey sweetie
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient
Yeah
Is suffering from a lack of concepts
Uh-huh
Originality
Ugghh
His flow is weak
Another one
And he has no style
Ugghhh
What you got for him?
Tssss okay

Let me put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late
But like a thief it takes
Time to be this great
Uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace
Your rhymes are fifth-place
And I'm just grace
One, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix whatever you shall break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday
Gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him

Good afternoon Dr. Carter
Nurse
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down
Vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lacks respect for the game
Uhhhh let me see
You think you can save him?

Okay, respect is in the heart
So that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid
Plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting something
'Cause you just like it
So you say it just like it
Some say it's biting
But I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing
Now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting
My passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind
I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it
And I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one

Good evening Dr. Carter, it's been a long day
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese erection
Fashion patrol police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to right
Too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice
Swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow
His blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow
This one's starting to show
Strong signs of life
Where's the stitches, here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply "What a night"
"Welcome back, Hip hop — I saved your life"

He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one, Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good
He's good, we got him
We saved him, he's a go
He's good



Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worse than dead, his brain is gone


I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name

He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead

Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin'? I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I'll always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lawd

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy
Gone but not forgotten, no

I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name

He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead

Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin, Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten

Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that

Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worse than dead, his brain is gone



StreetRunner

So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you, can't, blame, me
If I set this stage on fire!

Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing
But I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot and I say, "No bitch, I'm blazing
Like, what the fuck you expect? I'm a motherfucking Cajun"
And I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it
Bitch, I Kix it
No cereal, like a landing, I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
That's too explicit, well why you listening?
I smell smoke, and something's sizzling
That's her pussy, so hey pussy
Play with pussy or play pussy

But you, can't, blame, me
If I set this stage on fire

They say you're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Well, where I'm from you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
And you know what they say, when you great
It's not murder, it's assassinate
So assassinate me, bitch
Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch
Same balcony like "Assassinate me, bitch!"
It's Lil Tunechi
I don't rap, I film movies
With my rap
You can call me Mr. Director's Chair, yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut! On to the next
Not the next scene, bitch, the next check
Some say the X makes the sex 'spect
So play with the pussy or play pussy

You wear all the finest clothes
Lay pussy, do what I, say pussy
And I say, I say, lay pussy
And your grill is shining
Lay pussy, lay pussy, haha, hey pussy
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you, can't, blame, me
If I set this stage on fire!
Hey pussy, don't play pussy
Get 'em!

Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart, bitch, like the times are medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil
It's all in your head, it's all so cerebral
Call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you
Straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
Remember when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
He could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

But you, can't, blame, me
If I set this stage on fire!

C3, 3 peat




Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, goodfellas
Cut our ears off, ain't shit you could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin' love letter
If I ain't a trendin' topic, I'm a fuckin' trend-setter, I'm on

Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

If you're scared, go to church, Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin' a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gone probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range

You can get two shots from wherever, two shots from whoever
It be like a puzzle tryna put you back together
I should probably do better but probably, whatever

Your bullshit is stinkin' up the place
Me no tek bad up, me a done de place
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her "nutcase"
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball
Two shots of whatever
Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever

Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever



I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
All these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We wen't from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking tonight
I'm a Southerner delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today, I took a walk outside and...


Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
Cuz promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' illegal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
Yea, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker I don't shoot ya, bitch I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint like Spike Lee nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside and...





We are at war with the universe
The sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da, ooohh
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They tryna tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting
Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
Let's pray

These friends they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And you're next, so try they can't steal your pride, it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know

Yeah, yeah, yeah
See right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
We need love
That's all y'all, that's all

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

Yeah, born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So accept my emotion
Do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul and I must be me
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit
We got soul y'all, we got soul
They don't want us to see, but we already know



Yeah
That's right
That's right
Bitch
You know
Bitch, bitch


Stepping out the motherfucking car
They in awe
I'm looking like a star, bitch
When you see me make a wish
Holla at your motherfucking boy, J.R
Birdman my pa, bitch
Ball bred, born rich
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed
'Cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip
And that .40 make a chip
Out a potato-head wimp
Then, like ranch, I dip
And the hustle is all muscle
Just strength
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle
I got my hand on the game
Yeah I make a grip
Hundred grand in my fist
Same on my wrist
Get ki money from a quarter
Blame it on my wrist
I whip coke like hoes
Nigga I'm a pimp
Lil nigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money
Baby, now we talking

Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

Nigga, get it in a slump
If you know how
In the heart of the summer
We need a snow plow
What you know about that
Baby, it's your time
Coke transactions
On the phone we call it "blow jobs"
Too fast for the feds
Too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch
Getting sloppy with the pots
Hopping off the boat
Meeting Papi at the docks
He tell me I'm gaining weight
I tell him I'm getting paid
Money Over Bitches, I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age
Go after what pays
These Gabbana sunshades
Block the sun rays
I drop a car note in the mall on the first date
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way
That cake, like it's-it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace
Ya heard me?
Where money's more important than a person

Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

Twisting up a blunt
Thinking 'bout my next dollar
I'm digging in the game
Trying to get some money out her
I'm so vain it's a problem
There ain't a stain on these Pradas
I'm just being modest
Got me a goddess
Show her how to divide it
She still down
And she don't get none of the profit
Wheel around the city, let the tints hide me
"That's a cold motherfucker, whoever inside it"
Forever symbolizing the grind
It don't walk to you
I make it run like horses do
Giddy-up baby
If he got it then hit him up baby
I know it's crazy
But I can't get enough baby
I love it, I fucking love it
I'm a self-made millionaire
Fuck the public
Riding to myself
'Cause I don't fuck with nothing
Pistol on my lap
On the way to the money

Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
Get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money



Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

What’s understood ain’t gotta be explained
But you don't understand me
So let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flame
The snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow
My dreads swang
He had hair like wool
Like Wayne
Dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out
And they fall on the rifle
Scary
Hail Mary
No tale-fairy
All real, very
Extra-ordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel
Down to battle
Now or never
Or whenever
And the F for
"Fucking fantastic"
Fuck if you agree
I'm bright
But I don't give a fuck if you see me

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Miss Cita pain
Now it's Young Money baby, keep the change
My momma say "Fuck em!", and we the same
So hello motherfucker, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know, church fit, then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'?
If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
Cause you thought Little Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Wayne

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I was watchin' TV the other day, right?
Got this white guy on there talking 'bout black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine Black Americans are locked up
And see what the White guy was trying to stress was that
The money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail
A young motherfucker to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers
You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that
Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine
And regular cocaine
The police are... only
I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs, because
Crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And um you know, the other thing is mostly found
You know where I'm going
But why bring a motherfucka to jail
If it's not gonna stand up in court
Because this drug ain't that drug
You know, level three, level four drug, shit like that
Mhmm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding
And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers
You know, that one in every nine
We probably only selling the crack cocaine
Just because we in the hood
And it's not like your suburbs
We don't have the things that you have
Why? I really don't want to know the answer
But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah
You know we don't have room in the jail now
For the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know
Sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that
Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one of them sex offender papers
Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mmmhmm
Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you
Sex offender, on the level 3 drug
Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got
Don't stop the track, that's the good weed
You know what, I have a fucking daughter
You understand me?
And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail
Just because the reason why he live next door to me
Ain't the reason why I live next door to him
Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out, bring him to jail for life
And then you move in a sex offender, hahahah
They giving me a paper, hahah
Is that a misunderstanding, cause I don't understand it
Another thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this
Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton; here's why I don't respect you
And nobody like you, hmm-hmm, see
You're the type that gets off, on gettin' on other people, hahah
That's not good, no homo
And rather unhuman I should say
I mean, given the fact that humanity
Well, good humanity, rather
To me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race
But this guy, and people like him
They'd rather speculate before they informate
If that's a word, heh heh
You know, 'spect before check, anyway
Meanin', I much rather you talk to me first and see if you
Can learn an opinion before you make one
Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man
Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me
So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say
Or think about me, or whatever I do
Is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost
To me, and, it doesn't make you a good person to
Criticize before you improvise
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but
The characteristics fall heavily into bad sway, hahahh
But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well
But I try my hardest to stay good
And some of the things I do and say may be bad
Or just, not too good
But I do try
So with that said, I don't fault you
I mean, you're only human
Good or bad, but I also don't respect you
And I don't care if that's good or bad, heh heh
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson
You a nobody, to me
You're just another Don King with a perm
Just a little more political
And that just means you're a little unhuman than us humans
And now, let me be human by saying fuck Al Sharpton
And anyone like him
Fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
Heheh, why?
Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood
Bring the hook in

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Athletes still gettin' jacked like they missin' tires

Tell them niggas that be hatin' we ain't messin' round
They just barkin', they just fakin', they gon' settle down
We got bitches, we got beer, we got Bobby Brown
Skatin' underneath the bridge, dead body found
Do a trick over the body, hope he smilin' down
Do a trick off of some stairs, land on solid ground
Grizzly Gang in this bitch, check the grip tape

And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady

Walking 'round saying "You got a nice-ass house!"
My phone keep ringing though, my bad
I think my girl got me on spy cam now
My homies call cocaine "White trash"
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I cannot fuck wit' you bitch, cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worrying 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustlin'
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's runnin'
Bitch, don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard this a young nigga killed it
Cause I go too hard, I eat beats, mmm, scrumptious, delicious
Shoot you in your kidneys
I hope you see blood when you pissin'
We run up in your house on Christmas
And don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present
While they open their presents
Oh please, Lord, forgive me
I just talked to my Reverend
Asked him if I'm the Devil
He said "That's these bitches"
See, I'm from New Orleans
That bitch is infested
Shootouts like the Westerns
Kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly
Two Ninas, they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one'd get jealous
I make money, not exceptions
Take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments
Free all my dogs in corrections
We all we got, don’t need extras
We don’t expect shit
We don’t get mad over pussy
I’m probably lyin' in some pussy
While fools out here dyin' over pussy
And that’s what I don’t understand

Cause a young nigga livin' right
Yeah, a young nigga livin' right
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
Bitches see me and start gettin right
Because they know a nigga livin' right

Standing on the top, I got a
Lot of observations
Young nigga, lot of options
You, You..
Runnin' through a check
Buyin' all the champagne
Blowin' up the net
And settin' all the trends
Showin' niggas what’s next
I was drinkin' coffee
Smokin' weed on the jet
Probably wit' your wifey
In the back for pillow talk
But we ain’t talkin'
Gettin' top while ain't no top
Swear to God I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hoppin' out a helicopter
I be rollin' up the Doctor’s wishes
Countin' up the money, kickin' out the bitches
Cause they all up on you, but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain’t shit but a brick through your windshield
Shows in the evening
Business meetings in the morning
Goons on deck, don't make a nigga sick 'em on ya
Niggas talkin' shit
Gon' make a nigga get pneumonia
Wrist so cold
Think it’s sick and got Ebola
Crib so big
Got a bitch in every corner
Joint smoke good
Cause I showed her how to roll it
In the morning I got meetings with my lawyer
Arguments I’ll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we'll  never see a shortage
Nigga run up on me, he gon' be a goner
Bruce Wayne whip
I got a new favorite bitch
I got a joint I just rolled that got a Liu Kang kick
I gotta do it big
That’s just how I do things

Cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
Bitches see me and start gettin' right
Because they know a nigga livin' right

My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out
Lifespan, motherfuckin’ lifespan –
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out
Ooh, I swear these hoes ain’t right man
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now
Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won’t hesitate to pull it right back out
Life coach? I don’t need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin ups and downs
Tell a bitch "Don’t ask no questions"
My money so old
I tell my new money "Respect your elders"
I’m startin to get jealous
Of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy
A young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexin'
I’m countin my blessin's
"Achoo," "God bless me"
"Thank you," "You welcome"
I talk to my Reverend
Asked him if there’s a heaven
A heaven for a G, because me and my Gangstas
Done done it all, but never tell
He say “We already in Hell”
I say “Ain’t that a bitch”
Cause I work too hard, but still thankful as if
This shit came as a gift
I just pray for my niggas that’s out here still slangin that shit
Keep my distance, I can’t take that risk
I hope they understand

Cause a young nigga livin right
Yeah, a young nigga livin right
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
Bitches see me and start gettin right
Because they know a nigga livin right



Psycho, you got me psycho

I take pictures of her when she not lookin'
Study 'em microscopically
Marry me and then bury me
And then bury her on top of me

Psycho, you got me psycho

Crazy bout her attitude
Crazy bout her shampoo
Jealous of her shadow dude

Jump without a parachute

You ain't gotta never move
Lookin' all edible
And I'm ready when you're ready to

Girl you already know

Addicted to your love, a motherfucker need a Betty Ford

Nigga ridin' round checkin' doors

Baby come at me I'm not backing down

I never knew a girl would have me out here trippin'

I done lost all my love and found my way without you
I done gave up my soul, and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart, and wiped off my eyes
Without you, without you, yeah

Hands around this bottleneck, mmh

And when I do, I dream of you
And then the Devil pinch me
Do you ever miss me?
Do you ever wish we
Get it right and the rest is history?
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my lack of time
'Cause back then I had to grind
But see, you thought I’d rather grind

And now I fantasize and agonize
To pass the time
Lord

And wiped off my eyes
Yeah

And I look like I'm by myself, fuck
But I'm getting through it
I might as well
'Cause I know time will tell
But it be moving like a snail, yeah
You got a new one
I wish you well
Then I bite my nails
I'm scared I might hear wedding bells, uh
I guess I blew it
It never fails
You was tired of waiting to exhale
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my frame of mind
Back when everything was fine
And we would never think of dying
And I was yours and you was mine
And we combine and intertwine
And now we in decline
Finish line
End of time, Lord

I done spent so many
Of my days without you
I done lost all my love
And wiped off my eyes
Yeah

Now you've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong?
I'm left to live life alone
I'ma need more Styrofoams
If you find your way home
You know that porch light is on
I lay in bed wishing your side was warm
We wish we could go back in time
And push it in reverse
Cause this shit ain't for us
Baby, this shit for the birds
But I know what I'll do
I'll move on, I got to
And this is to you, for you
About you, without you, girl

Of my days without you
I done lost all my love, Lord)
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes
Without you, without you

How you doing? I can tell, yeah

And if you got beef I'll put the biscuit on a patty
Rockstar tatted, big-money addict
Running this shit, now I'm feeling athletic

I'mma shoot em, I'mma pay the bail, I'm sure of this
I'mma kill em, I'mma get the witness, teach 'em more of this
We never sing, not even on a song, where the chorus is
Dig the hole, get the wood box, bring the florist in
Tell the pastor, tell the family, we was just warning them
38's, 45's, all type of Tauruses
About to hit the bong, pour the Holy water in
Celebrating, for participating, in the slaughtering
Eating steaks at the same spot, they killed Paulie in
Frank White's three in the quarter, taping your daughter in
Columbia with the connect, putting the order in
Nigga act, we gonna clap, like we the audience
Make sure you wipe down the strap, get rid of all the prints
Do your homework on, whoever you go to war against

I had 20s on my Benz, lend it to all my friends
And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy
And if I need something call Baby, I need something call Baby
And the streets was calling me, but a nigga had call waiting
And yeah we all went through our phases, we all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shaving
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient, cause they say you are what you eat
I took the star out of starvation, bitch
I come from a Third World, start rapping in the fourth grade
Start trapping in the sixth grade, went platinum in the tenth grade
Dropped out a nigga getting paid, this when Birdman had a fade
This when Hummers didn't come stretch, but Birdman had 'em made
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones, you could waste time and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hemmed up
And all them niggas that's biting got they fins cut

I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"

And we gon' be around 'till yo motherfuckin' body rot
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got

But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the worm hole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch
This when niggas called Diddy Puff
Letting Biggie bump while I'm sitting up in that big body
I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape, call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had kilos, I needed one key I would've made copies
Free my niggas down and Rest In Peace to all my dead partners
I smoke bout a pound in like a week, and fuck the Weight Watchers
Got my self a brand new triple beam, just to weigh options
I stumbled upon a gold mine, I thank God that it ain't copper
Some niggas were late bloomers, but boy, look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And dead man can't talk and the Feds don't have séances
Look you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through customs, cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga laying behind them bushes

I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"

And we gon' be around 'till yo motherfuckin' body rot
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got

Street fi-di-di-di-damn

Kermit, you better think before you ribbit
Don't get murdered over your song, before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit, but given I'm at your crib it's
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They trying to tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in
My Little Man is on ya, Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lasagna
Forty Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian nigga
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop top, they say it's Ocean Drive inspired
So you can call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

Uhh, I get money like a muh'fucker
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Ohh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, money you ain't never see
Yeah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

I'm on the grind 'til the police come
With that pistol on my side boy, don't be dumb
Or, I let that semi twirl you
Now you can follow the drip cause one shot outta the clip'll jheri curl ya
Leave you sloppy like seconds, obey me like peasants
Or get opened up like presents, please
My young boys wildin' for respect
Slit your throat, have you smiling with your neck, say cheese
My dough's a bit longer, my flow is just slaughter
My wrist look like frozen Poland Spring water
So tell me boys, tell me boys, who you think you messin' with
I get money out the ass, that's some expensive shit
Haven't you all heard? Y'all all herbs
I stick toothpicks in y'all hors d'oeuvres
Listen, I'm a shark, y'all just koi fish
Octopus, oysters

London on da Track, bitch

We catch a body and we laugh about it
I fucked her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Grinding is agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet
I lost my mind, I'm like, "Fuck everybody"
Yeah, I lost my mind, but I got extra copies
Yeah, I fuck so long, it feel like exercising
I'll test a lion before testifying
All I got is hitters in my squad
I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Zero fucks given
I make her come to the condo buttnaked, 'Cause, bitch, ain't no stealin'
She still come visit, she don't wanna leave, she compared it to me leaving a witness
I said I get it
I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches
And this AK is not for decoration
Fuckboys give me the heebie-jeebies
I got a hit list like the Yellow Pages
Hey, if she can suck a dick and snort a Quaalude
Then, ooh, baby, you got my full attention
Champagne expensive, it taste good or vintage
Open your nose, I'll put some sugar in it
I don't fuck around with them fuck-arounds
I might fuck around and catch a body
I got some niggas that'll hunt you down
And catch you slipping like you playing hockey
Woo, we catch a body and we laugh about it
I fuck her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Money and drugs, I'm talking math and science
Skinny tires, on a salad diet
Chopper leave you with a half a body
Make sure he dead
Before we leave, my nigga, grab his wallet
I got the hook up on them rocket launchers
I told Obama "Fuck with me, you know I got it"
Slim, you need to fuck with me, you know I got it
I know somebody that know somebody
Look, traffic dying, we still trap-or-dying
It's agonizing, but it's gratifying
Squad; I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
Want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Hold up, you ain't got no hitters in your squad
I could get you killed, that's my real day job
I'm a crime of passion, I'm a fucking hate crime
Spit like I ate bombs, Eminem on 8 Mile
I'm the motherfucking man, Scarface, Facemob
Pockets looking like The Blob, chips like Cape Cod
Bust your motherfucking egg til I see egg nog
My boujee bitch ratchet, my ratchet bitch a straight snob
Hold up, who know how to read gang signs?
Cause we gon' throw 'em up and we gon' give 'em hang time
I got white, I got brown; sell it at the same time
That's that James Brown and that's that James Bond, ooh
We catch a body and we laugh about it
It's catastrophic but we glamorize it
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet
Chopper leave you with a half a body
No hesitation, no stall, like the bathroom crowded
Chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me

Tunechi

And I'm so sorry for the wait

With the dreams
Of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rolling in foreign cars
Through the streets of 3rd ward
It was all momma leave 'em with, a trace of Mo. E
And promethazine
And he the codeine fiend
And his team was the coldest
Everyday they rolled thick

Hey Millz show em how its done

Part-time broker late nights she work at Strokers
Her cousin name Mocah got a insane spine
But its crazy cause I fucked em both at the same time
I even gotta bitch in the bay name Jessica
I swear she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa gotta attitude, but her ass meaner
And she remind me of this ho I used to fuck name Sabrina
Ugly little thing from the home of the ravens
I only kept around cause her ass was amazin
Tiffany and Emily my bona fide sluts
When I cum they touch tongues and share that nut
Gotta white chick down in Florida name Sasha
On my momma her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo she let me fuck her on the washa
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take 10 dicks for you meet the president
Young Money !

And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plumy, and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld honey
I paper chase, fuck stand still money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we ridin' if the fan belt runnin'
Leave a mothafucker just layin' there bloody

She just want to be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks I go nutty butty
What it dizzle, is you or is you ain't my baby
Baby?

Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?

Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my night stand
With my pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand
Codeine in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne, and wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might
Cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan and I'm sure like white sand
That they'll be price paying before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore so I can't ignore what I want anymore
So I just go you can call me the goer
And oh, yeah, I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And uhm, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeah, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore, page one


Dear Anne, my number one fan
I write you this letter, I hope everything's grand
I hope everyone's good, I hope everybody's praying
I hope, hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit, Anne
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And everytime I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
Anne, I'm trying to stay up out them chicks' pants... but I just can't
But on another note, this ain't just another note
This is more than a rap, this is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just hoping that you read this far, page two


Dear Anne, my number one fan
By now, you probably think that I'm portraying who I'm saying
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him but I am
And it's people like you that make me proud of what I am
Hey, you are the shit, damn, pardon the gram'
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And shit, when my life is like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there, lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to begin
I just think of you then I'm rewarded again, Anne
With you is where my artistry can, Anne
So with you is where a part of me stands, Anne
I hope I see you in the stands, Anne
Because you know I understand, Anne
And I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say that I'm your number one fan

To listen to me whine?"

You diss me everytime

And now, I done got so high, I did forgotten who you are

I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town

Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
Cause I just come to take it
Then you know I gotta take off
But I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Cause she say "Wayne you ain't shit
You got me all impatient"
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscience while I sail off

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And so she's gone to party town, on her own
And you go by yourself, so all alone

One minute she love me, the next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she pray she have Weezy F's baby
And I be having seizures, but she say she can't shake me
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted
I say I like her more than she think I do
Girl, when I think of you
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo
I suck and fuck and finger you
But you want me to cling to you
And I ain't asking you to change
Cause I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways...
And you have your days...
And we gave it our best shot
But I just got grazed
I'm sorry

From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack
I'll turn your head to an open hot sauce pack
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts

Then smile at my thoughts
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a hawk

While it was parked
Now I don't wan' talk, bitch I don't wan' talk
Lean in my punch, I decided to spar
Anybody want war?

Before I even yawn
Stay in ya lane, I remind these lil boys
This is victory lane, now do I need a horn?
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won'ts

Most theses rappers is falling cause they ain't standing for nothing
I smoke that loud so I don't hear haters talking
Plus these bitches be stalking trying look for a fortune
In the Chi we say church when the pussy gets purchase
Got a bitch so bad she make a player get nervous
Now good ain't good enough and my hood is hood as fuck
I be praying for them shorties trynna get their dollars up
Swag so dope you probably think I'm dealing
And I only give head if baby girl swallow children
Boo ain't got a ghost and bitches still be catch the holy ghost
She say she want to get high I hit her with that overdose
Pimpin' so cold put that on my overcoat
Only ride foreign
We don't do 100 spokes
When broke niggas talk that's 100 jokes

On my truck right I don't give a fuck boy



Cut the fuckin’ music up

Phone in her back pocket made the EHHHH
Phone in her back pocket made her booty call

This song right here is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush


This song is dedicated to the one with the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef with you-know-who
Fuck it, he just let em kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had our niggas sitting on top their roofs
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lotta stealing going on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady?
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some folk that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy

Everybody drowned, and

I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the White House hating
Trying to wash us away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest
They saying that you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say dont worry bout it
And the children have been scarred, no ones here to care bout 'em
And fat shout, to all the rappers that helped out
When you see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still movin' then he holdin' it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tches
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yeah!


Oh yeah
You thought we was done? Nah

Weezy Baby that crack, motherfucka, get a fix
Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich
Yep, I'm a motherfuckin' trip
I'm a trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
900 to a grand, get you 28 grams
If you talking bout bricks, I'm the interstate, man
And the women say "damn", them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And with no pen I'm sorta like a bomb "Boom"
Young Tune, yeah that's what my people call me
50 thousand for the cross, tryna keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yeah
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yeah, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, Purple Heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game, no arguing
And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep your bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch, log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin'
Mike Jordan, pardon my swag
But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said "fuck it" - bought 2 houses in Miami
I can't wait to do Cribs; MTV, come on, get at me
Any rapper wan' get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half a hundred for a feature, wanna battle? I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of Miss Cita
Mom dukes, my Jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna be the boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Not a sim simma, 10 keys in the Beamer
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfuckin' ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin'
Spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patron, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that rage flow
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hoes
Price rising for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got dough
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, $60,000 a verse



I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy, daddy?
I need a daddy, daddy

Come and make it Wayne down on me

Wide receiver Weezy, throw the pussy at me
The pussy lips smiling, I make the pussy happy
Take them panties off, the pussy lookin' at me
I'm the pussy monster, now get the pussy ready
I like to kiss. She like to kiss
I deep stroke and make her bite her fist
The lights is on, the night is grown
We get it poppin' cause we know we can't when wifey home
California kush - strong as a Titan - is what I'm lightin' on
We get high as fuck then we "Just Do It" put your Nikes on
Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she'd like to say
I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style...but that's expected
She coming back to you? The chances anorexic
I knew she had it in her, so I got it out her
She rub my back, she say I'm tight
She cook, fuck and clean
And still make her flight!
First-class pussy, crystal glass pussy
I get it wetter than bass pussy

I likes it thick and red
Ralph Lauren spread
Lady in the streets, porn star in bed
She like to fuckfight, so we spar in bed
She got that pink pussy, I beat it orange/red
I fuck American pie and I get foreign head
She sit down and ride like I'm a thoroughbred
She kiss mine, and I kiss hers back
If she's a bad bitch
She deserve that
She send me pictures to my iPhone
Then I gotta clear em cause my girl be checking my phone
I'm in the Bentley with the mind blown
When I'm in that pussy, honey, I'm home

You dun been good, but you can do better
I dun been wet, but I can get wetter
Come and make it Wayne down on me











I'm looking up at heaven, hoping my niggas made it
While I'm tryna get them demons, out of my demonstration
I'm like fucking right I'm flexing on these pancake ass niggas
These niggas must be nuts, I castrate these niggas *pause*
Then she stuck out her tongue
Well since you act like a dog I'mma fuck you like one
I got this Tec in my draws, and I murder for fun
Man all these niggas the same, it's like we watching re-runs
And I am salt in the wound, I am soap in ya eye
These bitches thinkin' they fly, I tell em' roaches can fly
Even at my low bitch I'm high, I'm tryna stay focused I'm fine
But if I crack one of these niggas like a glow stick he shine
And when they ask me where I'm from I say the Great State of Mind
OK that loud got me stanky, that lean got me cranky
They tell me think it over over and I end up over-thinking, agh!

Cause I don't know how fake feel nigga
Cause all my life I've been a real nigga
Yeah all my life I've been a real nigga
Kidnap yo wife, fuck her and still kill her
Yeah and I don't wanna take pills nigga
But it's either that or take chances nigga
We bout that action, these niggas action figures

Uhh, Young Money on another level
I like her pussy tighter than my fucking schedule
Man I love hitting yo bitch, like a Lucky Seven
I'm running this shit, you niggas running errands
Money ain't shit to me
I smoke all these niggas, call it Niggatine
Yellowbone pussy, uh lemon squeeze
I ain't too proud to beg, so nigga please
Fake ass, bitch ass
You faker than yo bitch ass
Weed good, bitch bad
Fat mouth, slim chance
I see you niggas hatin', with ya hatin' ass
I'm just lightin' up, like laser tag
Chopper clips is too long, send you back to where you came from
Yeah, pussy niggas get banged up, I wish you would give a name up
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
They find yo motherfucking body in the woods nigga
We on that good nigga, we ain't no G.O.O.D niggas
You niggas stand under me, understood nigga?



Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I’ll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I’m going’ outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You’re the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you

Yo, young money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich I could buy you
Kill bitches leave their body in a bayou

C-A-R-T-E-R
Put the beat in ER
I'm colder than B-R
Add another three Rs
Watch me like DVD/VCR
Pump to your chest, I ain't talking CPR
Riding this track like a motherfucking street car
New Orleans coroner, his name is Frank Minyard
Fuck with me wrong, you’ll be waking up in his yard
Man, I go crazy on the beat, I go Nimrod
Man, I act a ass, treat the beat like a hemorrhoid
Man, I go to work on the beat, call it employed
Man, I kicks it, bitch, get your shin guard
Young Money run this

They pump 'em like krumpers
Anybody's beat, I'm gon' go Archie bonkers
Tunechi be the wildest
Lets run the metropolis
I pop like lollies
You drop like eyelids
The money keep calling
I hear the shit dialing
And they say money talks
You can hear my shit hollering
You softer than nylin
Oops, I meant nylon
Perfection is the goal
And I’m headed to the pylon
Crown fit me good
I ain’t even got to try on
The pistol mean business
That bitch should have a tie on
T done told me do this shit
So I had to do this shit
I get super hero money
Call a nigga super rich
Keep it "super" for a while
Let me get on my "super" shit
Super ill, super sick

Super Millz, Mack, Tyga, Streets, Neli, Super Nick
Super Drizzy, Gudda, Chuckie, Twist
That's the super-clique
Now I’m off that "super" shit
Fuck that shit, I super quit
Running circles 'round the game

You're gonna have to loop this shit
There won’t be a duplicate
And my blunts be super thick
I'm higher than a Supra kick
I’m the bomb, baby
Watch me nuke this shit
When I leave the booth
They gotta scoop this shit
My apologies
Diabolically

I look in the flames and see a hotter me
But how come I’m still colder than commonly
Yeah we run this town, like a lot of feet
Young Mula, baby
I'm proud of me



With my first hundred Gs bought my mom a house
Bitch, don’t try to suck my dick if you got cotton mouth
Watch these snitches, man
These rats think they Mighty Mouse
In the kitchen
Arm & Hammer, just the right amount
Got the dope spot popping, dope spot jumping
Car parked by itself, robot stunting
And it’s voice activated, I just tell it something
I ain’t even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes
I don’t eat no Rally’s
I don’t eat my words, nigga
I don’t eat no salad
I got too much on my plate
I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before
It’s like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fucking talent
Rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye
Be romantic
Please don’t worry, Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smoking
I'll whip they ass if they don’t pass it
Hold up, I just got a package
I let my bitch test it
With flying colors, passed it
Burning money fast
Like fire on the plastic
You dead man walking
Throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs
Is half dead as it is
I still keep the heat on me
Attitude Cavalier
Boy, I think your whole clique’s Summer’s Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7, Vagisil
And my name don’t need no adjectives
And my flow don’t need no ad-libs
The boot' the battlefield
Flag red, like I’m Russian

Took a picture with the pistol
Gave it rabbit ears
These niggas got fast careers
Fast as Batmobiles
My bitches got sex appeal
They like sex and pills
For reals
I’m sorry if you hate you
And I’m sorry for the wait, too

Boom – It’s my shot like Biloxi
Even my shadow don’t trust me
Big dog in this shit, like a Husky
285, 20 pounds of musty
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two-seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana's I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying, "Big bruh"
You a bad bitch always saying, "Big Daddy"
You a real nigga talking ‘bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin
I say, "Let’s work," he say, "Let’s work"
Let your next work be your best work

And it’s that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I’m so sorry for the wait, too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU
You test my homies, we ace you
Tity, these niggas monkeys in ape suits

Got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy

I ain't asking them for nothing
If you sell a million records
We could battle for your money
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin'
Baby, yes I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market
With the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty
Have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out
The guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy, I got paper to reel in
I hope they snapping at the end of my rod
I hope I'm fishing in the right pond
And I hope you catching on to every line

That girl got you too too excited
That money had you too too excited
Them cars had you way out your character
That jewelry got you way out your character
Them girls got you way out your character
This fame got you way out of character
This flow got you way out of character
I showed you love now you way out of character

I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known

I should've known you would cross me
Because I'm on and I'm saucy
And I'm gone and you salty
Steam coming from your head like a coffee
My reality is better than your dreams nigga
My ho pussy hole is wetter than your dreams nigga
My ho legs spread wider than your wings nigga
Put your head in a microwave, DING! nigga
You out of character, slime, you out of character
And me I'm out of patience, sick and tired like Malaria
These hoes like mosquitoes
These niggas trying to be hoes
What happened to that boy and I ain't Pusha T though
Supa where the cup at
I'm working on my comeback
The girl I'm with got much class
But she got a dumb ass
I keep a money bag, a drug bag, and a gun bag
These niggas ain't even shining, making the sun mad
Rappers in my lunch bag
Me and Future have a food fight
Bedroom full of new dykes
Old green and new white
That's old money, that's new coke
That's Young Money, that's 24/7, 3-6-5
That's Cash Money; I'm like "Who ho" Who ho, who ho!?

I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I was looking in your eyes you ain't built like that
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me

They say I ain't a rapper I'm a trapper
I be with the robbers and the killers and the kidnappers
I'll fuck your bitch in your crib, watch the kids after
Still fuck a bitch, fuck the ring, motherfuck a pastor
I don't, I should've known she ain't really love me
I should've know she just want to fuck me
I fucked up, don't judge me
I got this money and I ain't turning down
This money'll turn your life up but bring your family down
Some of the closest niggas to me, they don't come around
Cause some of the closest niggas to me, I'll gun 'em down
For real
I should've known you'd cross me
I'm from the hood, that's where they taught me
Go hard until they off me

I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I got some niggas that was there
That ain't no longer there
I don't care
I don't cry about it
And I barely get sleep anyway
I should've known you would cross me



I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

Woah
She say, "I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
I saw some pictures of you boo'd up, it looks like you're starting to like 'em skinny"
I say "Girl, you a trip," she say "I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'"
She say "Watch these hoes, 'cause they leeches like Robin" I say, "No, Robin Givens"
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'
She say "I get it, and if anything was to happen to you, I'd be livid"
"You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit"
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
She say "I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion"
I said, "It never gets old, thought I'd never say never, but I did it
She say "Who you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, big booty, big titties; I admit it

I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
Saw a flick of you boo'd up, boy, you never liked em skinny
You tell me I'm a trip, well, I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin'
Boy, this here will keep you warm at night
Feed you good before you catch a flight
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type
Who you kiddin'?
I admit it, I admit it

But I got these guns on me right now
I got these drugs on me right now
I got the Feds on me right now
I got two buyers, want it right now
She took her clothes off and I stopped
Looked at my watch, like "Fuck it, why not?"
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She say, "I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit it, quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good, thick bitch in a minute"
I say, "You ain’t never lying; thought I’d never say never, but I did it"
She said "Speaking of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness"
"Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'"
She said, "Who you kidding, boy? you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, I like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties; I admit it

I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

Yes I am a beast, I swear I needs to be tranquilized
Yes I am a giant, next to me you are just ankle high
Yes I eat that pussy, oh, how do I love that panty pie

I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle
And withdrawal sucks
And dead presidents act immortal
But I know you see money's not a problem
Bal' like a butch bitch

The harder I fall, the farther I reach
The water might fall, but life is a beach
When my number’s called, I get out my seat
When my niggas ball, I give em my speech
You might hit a wall, or end up like me
You might have to crawl, but get up like me
And you bite before bark
Never I before we
And you pray before eating
And you lay with your heat
And you stay with your heat
And you lay on your mink
Bitches lay at your feet
And you play with your kids
You don’t play with these niggas
Don’t play on these streets
I don’t play on these beats

You heard what I say; no replay, no repeat
Don’t be playing with me

Hollow tip bullets, blue tip bullets

Ah.. Pop another percocet
My flow is retarded, I think I got a birth defect
Highway to heaven Bow! Where the fuck the chauffeur at?
These niggas softer than the pillows on my sofa set
I'm fighting myself cause I don't see no competition
I don't write, I draw that pistol make your face a composition
So please walk away before we stomp your ass
Everyday is halloween and you can get your pumpkin smashed
The ones you think your friends is really your haters
So just do me a favor.. and don't do me no favor
All I need is a blunt and a cup of purple
I put this together, I could've been a construction worker
Niggas looking funny, well I'm just getting blunted
And everybody's wondering if I'm really with Young Money
Well is a pig's pussy pork? Do bears be shittin'
In the woods and wipe they ass with a rabbit when they finish?
Turn my swagger super mean but my bitches bad too
And my flag bright red but Lortab blue, Oop!
Isn't it ironic I tell Tunechi pass the chronic
Purple syrup, yellow Fanta, you can call it Magic Johnson

Gone off the shrooms, I'm stoned like tomb
Bitch, I do what I do like the groom
Looking death in the eyes, kissing fear on the lips
I'm so faded my nigga I'm bout to disappear in this bitch
Like poof, there go my roof
Pow, there go my hammer
Come around here stuntin', get jacked like O'Lantern
Two times for them haters, head shots for them snitches
If the best things in life are free then why the fuck we pay attention?
Uh, pockets on nine-months, I go dumber than a dunce
Two many pills, too many blunts
Two bitches named such-and-such
It's Young Money we out chea, we turnt up bout that life

Sixteen bullets in a clip, but more than one clip
Shoot a nigga sixteen times until I'm convinced
I got strawberry cocaine as sweet as Fun Dip
You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch

Cause she don't give me drama
You don't want no drama
My goons waitin' for you, to snap
Like some photo bombers

I was chilling on the corner about to get fucked up
My nigga T got a 40, and he brought two cups
That nigga Mack was chillin', Po was home talkin' on the phone
Lord, it's been such a good-year we need some Armor All
That nigga Hoody on the set, he got his hoodie on
Euro the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms
Wayne Chong, chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long
Lord, I know I do my thing, can’t let my thing do me
Lord, I know I ain’t a Saint, still rep that fleur-de-lis
Lord, just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me
Fuck your degree, this murder in the first degree
I got that Tec under my arm like Right Guard, Sure, Degree
Lord, sometimes I just be so gone I be like "Earth to me?"
I burn some weed, I burp some lean, I served a fiend
While I was

Hundred thousand on a small-ass chain
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the backyard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates far in front of ya
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, five floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that cost more than it
You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than Ms
I'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am
And foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant's clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin then my lawyers is
So what the charges is?
Put it on my tab, baller shit
I'm from the cell to the mall with this

Now tell them motherfuckers, I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden, I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden, I'm

Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley
And I'mma honk the horn, ridin' passed the penitentiary
And I'mma drive slow, ridin' passed the elementary
Then give it to my whoas, tell 'em "Don't even mention"

One time
For the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential said it's crunch time
Looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy
Never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line
Tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than sometimes
When the cops come, you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window
In the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch, you in a Enzo
Stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal
The bullshit cost me a mill
It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig
But end up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it
I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce
When I walk out the pen

My nigga I'm, I'm post-bail ballin, post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm, I'm post-bail ballin'
Post-bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm, I'm post-bail ballin'
Farewell warden, I'm post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm post-bail ballin'

Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley
And I'mma honk the horn ridin' past the penitentiary
And I'mma drive slow ridin' past the elementary
Then give it to my whoas, tell 'em "Don't even mention"
Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley

Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin'

The revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down in Comstock
These bitches call me Bling King, I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas, flawless and D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin' on a nigga as I'm walkin' the valley, ready?
And zoomin' with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you niggas can't believe
Like purchase persons, places all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I hope you niggas know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper, niggas know I'm handlin' my biz

Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

Word to my mama, I'm gon' continue bombin'
Told her getting out the game is like coming out of a coma, I'm trying
But I'm normal when this rap shit get boring
All I ask is that you pray for me, please
And the beat keep crying, and I'ma keep beating her
Fee, I'm fucking her, I'm deep in her, sleep in her
And what happens when the Reaper come
I'm just hoping that he sends that elevator up
I made enough, I ain't make shit
So while I'm here, I'ma take that and take this
Breakfast, yes, let's eat, wipe your mouth when you finished
Then hunt for the lunch and dinner
No beginner to the criminal activity
Fuck with them, they rushing in like Seminoles, Indians
No bow and arrows, Harold, just Ninas, Gina, just choppers, Robert
Carter II, tell me, how is you gon' stop a riot?
I lock and seal it I'm the best, I can feel it
I'm in the lead, I could pop a wheelie
Not for rookies, late bloomers, stay in the womb
I'm here motherfucker, make room, boom
Young Tune, the big kahuna
It's my ocean, baby, y'all niggas is tuna
Better now than sooner, Junior
Flying 'round your city, tryna take a number two on ya

I'm hungry, like I didn't eat
I want it, like I didn't see a mill before 17
What the fuck you niggas telling me?
You pups can't keep up with the pedigree
Catch me where the weather be, somewhere in the 70s
Call myself settling, palm trees, promethazine
But, what's new? Sometimes I can't cut through that rough loop
Get fucked so many times 'til it's "Fuck you"
So, how you wanna do it baby? We can get it
All you gotta do is say it and I'm with it
Money and murder, you my nigga, my jelly preserver
I'ma ride, baby, 'til the judge give me a verdict
Hear me or heard me, I get it and serve it
'Cause every time I did it, I hit it and hurt it, yeah
Now I kill it, the mission accomplished
The niggas abolished, the bitches astonished, and
Then they pay homage, when did they find it? But
Now that they know, it's a must I remind 'em, so
They don't forget it, I underline it, and
I'm in the sky, when the thunder's cryin', young'n
I been through all that, I done done what you sayin'
I put it down when the others was playin'
When the jungle was open, I rolled in with the riders
Stole food from the bears, and brought it back to the lions
Hold court with the apes, I'm a gorilla but lighter
Got the eye of a tiger, the heart of a fighter, yeah
Start 'em, ignite 'em, I walk through fire
Watch the flames start multiplyin', woo, yeah
Alter a nigga, Nina, talk to a nigga
Take a chunk out your body like a shark bit a nigga
I'm awkward like Cartwright, fuck with a nigga
Shot ugly but my arch right, come on, dawg, bark, bite
Fork in the road, I'm always going right
Nowadays, knowing life ain't no more road lights
We can't see, but we gon' make it to the finish line
It's right there, the goal line, right behind the scrimmage line
Touchdown, check the scoreboard, gimme mines
Semi-9 fit me fine, hit a nigga twenty times
Damn, then one more to the face
Just so they close the casket, like I pay to close the case
I'm made, straight Mafia shit
Front line, top rank, ready to die for my shit
And the obvious shit, if I talk about my rivalry, they probably get rich
So fuck 'em, I'ma let 'em sit
And I ain't ducking 'cause I'm right here, I'm just enough
I don't care who at the top of the stairs, I'm stepping up
See, you fucking up the money, baby, and that ain't good business
You starting to look like a witness, and this is
For the gangstas and the bitches, the hustlers and the hoes
Crossover, whatever; mainstream? No
'Cause Wayne thinks silent, Wayne'll never fold
You heard it right here if the game was ever told
Lift up your toes and look under a rug
Trust me, that's history under all that dust
So deep down in the dirty, there lies us
Yeah, Cash Money Records and I'm still up front
Stunna, pop a bottle, Baby, peel us a blunt

Like Glacius
Gracias
I'm crazy, yes
It's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder
And a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing
I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas
Bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet
Close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet
Drop a 4 in the bubbles
I remember being young
Trying to hustle my dope
Trying to tell the old junkies
That my crack ain't soap
Trying to tell you 'fore you jump
That my Mac ain't broke
You ain't trying to see how far
That black back lane go
Call me Pac-Man
Your ghosts is blue
I got my red river rubies
And my ocean blue
Jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating
But I got a tapeworm in my tummy
Make harm
And I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm
No warning, nothing
Look, it's morning
No yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up
Trying to take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga
Break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts
And we taking what we want
I'm so 504 you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me
Bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army
Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me
But I still be here
No chrome on the Continental
I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil'
Crack the roof
And roll up the windows
And my hood love me
They tell me bring it home
That's why I holla Hollygrove
On each and every song
You leaping at a dog
A dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa
I'm talking 'bout Stunna
He like "Keep your dough"
He got your ho
When the sun shines on the King
And sets on the Prince
I met the Birdman
And I been shining ever since
Like that



I hate gossip
And I don't walk around looking for it, you know?
But, yesterday it seemed to just
Wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop

Stop
Hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion
The lady of a nigga
And you can get tipped
Like you're waitin' on a nigga
Put a body bag
And an apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you can never see
If you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me
To win the title fight
But I'mma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm tryna be polite
But you bitches in my hair
Like the fuckin' po-lice
And my flow is rare
These other rappers nice
These other rappers bark
Some of 'em even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light
You just might, might wanna

Think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby

Stop
Analyzing
Criticizing
You should realize
What I am, and start epitomizing
Legitimate
I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident
Like fuck 'em all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick
So sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city
Because my city's crying
Because my city's dying
Still I emerge from all of that
I am a living pion-
-eer, near Zion
Fear God
Not them
Steer my robin coupe
Through the streets of the boot
And soowoo
And then I leak blood in the booth
I leave a bloodbath
Sorry there's a tub in the booth
Now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe
No, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot
Now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I-I-I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you?
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem
I won't even think
Just leave you dead
Like the mink
Under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I've graduated from hungry
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese
If I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef
I want a steak
And, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica
Where weed be
Hard body nigga
Just takin' it easy
All about my paper
Bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers
Why do rappers
Lie to fans, lie to rappers
Lot of rappers lie like actors
Cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga, fuck your props
And make it out to Mr. Hip-Hop
I'm not dead, I'm alive




I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me

He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant
There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

Kobe doin' work
2-4 on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game dunkin' on the whole team
Black Mamba, attack conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
Cause I'mma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with 3 seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in 3 seconds
Ya dig
That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me

One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James

I've been quoted saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumpin' over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all the Phil Jackson say teams
Better be passin' it to me
I put the master in the piece
Attack you like a beast
I am starvin' for victory
And that means I'mma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me


Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want
They want Kobe
And what he want
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off
You better be where that Laker don't
Yea, just give him the ball and he take it off
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah
Do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
MVP, MVP
Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me

"So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was ... Kobe Bryant"

And when I started cuppin I was sprung
And then I started druggin it was fun
Fucking with that honey I got stung
And when I go out clubbin I be numb
Started out from nothin just some crumbs
Started up from nothin just some crumbs
And now I got a bakery, yum yum
And now I see the fakery, now I see the snakery
All I got is 2 words, blum-blum
No Ceilings

Tune let me off the leash, now I run the fucking streets
Two fingers in her pussy, then I tell her pussy, "Peace!"

Tony, tell them bitches it's Libra gang
Vocal lessons, let the nina sing
Before I leave up out this bitch, they gon' know my fuckin' name
Birdman Jr. Junior! Fuck a dog, bitch I got a puma

Lame ass boys don't want no trouble, pussy niggas just a bunch of suckers
Smashing all they moms, you could call me a motherfucker

Pull big willie out my pants and all them girls say, "Hercules!"
Bitch I'm livin' B.I.G., my gun is little cease
If that girl don't pop it off, I'll just skeet right on her weave
Okay that gold pack in my pocket; I'm like a rag up in a socket?
And when I cock that nina nine, you better not cock block me
YM be the shit, I say, "Damn everybody else"
I be kicking girls out the condo, I got a black belt
Big bro said, "It's your time nigga"
You heard what the fuck the man said
Boy I body these verses, that's why they cost a arm and a leg

Young Mula baby




I loved her fancy underwear, I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get to tell her I'm the one she should be with
She's popular wit all the guys, so innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life, she woulda had the world if she were mine
But see she had other plans I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around

They loved her fancy underwear, every boyfriend, every year
She tried to keep them entertained when they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone, askin' herself, where did she go wrong
She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
Who don't believe in ties, tryin' to apologize
Never forget the day she left and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all






Yessir!
It's me, the rapper eater
Feed me, feed me, feed me!
No homo

One time for me, one time for the DJ
He be Khaled, I be Lil Weezy
Baby, if you ask me, if you're nasty
Creative, gifted bastard, spit sporadic
I'm so diplomatic, democratic
Touch it, bring it, push it, systematic
Damn right, I kissed my daddy
I think they pissed at how rich my daddy
Is, and I'm his kid, I stunt with my daddy
Call Miss Lee, she with my daddy
So diss me and don't diss my daddy
'Cause who was there when no one wasn't? Just my daddy
Who was there when I needed money? Just my daddy
So who be there when I see the money? Just my daddy
Who said that I'd be the one? Just my daddy
Hello hip-hop, I'm home; it's your daddy
When I say deez, I don't mean the Caddy
I mean deez nuts, Akon's and Khaled's
Rick Ross, T.I.P., Stunna and Fat Joe
And I ca-ca-can't forget Brisco
And yeah, I done squashed the bullshit with Zoe
It's a bakery here, just tryin' to get dough
Shout to my dreads, my Haitians and chicos
You lookin' for me, ho? I'm in the 3-0-
5, I'm the best rapper alive
Homeboy got a mind that a map wouldn't find
Homeboy got a 9 that a cop wouldn't find
But I could get to it even if I was blind
Like a scary movie, they screamin' when I rhyme
I'm a king, you can ask Stephen if I'm lyin'
I'm a Prince, too demandin' like my mom
Too bold, too cold like wet salam-
Mi, me, it's all about me
If the girl got a voice, then she talk about me, me
He say, she say, I say me
We'll be in the M-I-A-Mi
With me, and T, and big Roni
And the Homie streets, probly somewhere on the beach
And Taz and E probly somewhere in the Jeep
And Marley in the Phantom with Mister G
And me, me, it's all about me
Play with me and it's all-out beef
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!
Yikes! Yeeks! Great Scott
Storch, can I borrow your yacht?
Watch me and my clique go all out
Like the ball in the stands, we balls out
Boy, I don't know what y'all 'bout
But I just spit like a dog mouth
Pink ice, just lookin' like a hog mouth
Vroooom, I had to bring the hog out
Light them trees, bring a log out
Every day Christmas, I'm eggnogged out
And hip-hop is my new-bought house
My flow just grew legs and walked out; bye



No Ceilings, motherfucker

Nice tires on the 'Ghini, you should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable, zucchini
I live on the beach, she walk around in her bikini
Girls are like school, and I cut ‘em like seniors
I’m here to distinguish the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap, get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like Finas
This beat getting totalled, Pam, Keisha, Kima
Sitting on the world, thinking 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side, paint you like mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out a party
Be cool 'fore you get stomped and pulled out the party
Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Looking for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big, bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church, like a choir and a couple of old priests
Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors
I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours
Vince Young, suicide doors
Life’s a bitch, now die for her

I have the type of flow niggas don’t have to like
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don’t have to write
The way I’m eating niggas wish they had my appetite
Straight up out of Texas and I’m major like Applewhite
I pour four then I hit the exit door
Take a trip to Macy’s cop the whole second floor
Whores smell the scent of money coming out my pores
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, boy
I made it from a flyer to the Forbes
Young Elvis Freshley, yes he flyer than the stork
Dropping babies off in your chicks cheek, kicks neat
Got your son looking up to me like I’m 6 feet
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me
I’m knocking hoes down like Laila Ali
Try heat and I'mma put the toaster to your kidney
Then I pull off in a Bentley, top open like a chimney
It’s No Ceilings like a coliseum
The way I'm leaning I'm annoyed if I stand still
Flow harder than an anvil, Short

OK, it's Gudda, ho!, all about my Bills like Buffalo
Your bitch under my sheets, I heard she was an undercover ho
Purple got me moving slow like I’m in a snail race
Pop-pop-pop, 3 shots to the head then I pick up my shell case
Leave 'em with a pale face, yes, I am a young money goon
Your girl like a motion picture, she gon’ be coming soon
I do her somethin' rude, I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to Millz, then drop her off to Tune
Couple screws lose, you don't want to play with him
This is No Ceilings bitch, Roofless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us in your club? Well, nigga, pay us then
All grey BM, I’m getting it for my baby M
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in
Don’t play no games ho, you know my name ho
G-U-D-D-A, propane flow



Hardbody, motherfucker, got the heart of a killer
Young God in the building, 'bout to start a religion
Bout to call Bin Laden up and order some missiles
Bring em straight to your block and go to war with you bitches
If you hit the head, then the rest fall in position
Shoot a nigga on his porch and make him fall in his kitchen
Copped a big boy Porsche with all the specifics
And I keep that torch, baby call me Olympics
Red, white, blue pill; flip my skills like gymnasts
And never give a bitch money, blood, or kidneys
When the gun goes pow, I be at the finish
With my medal round my neck, autograph on my tennis
The land of the murder, dope, crack and syringes
Pull up on you in the Coupe, how fat is your engine
Never talk to those that sat on the benches
Boy, I was in the game on fourth and inches
These niggas want the business
I'mma give these boys the business
See, you fucking wit the boy that tote toys before Christmas
Got all these hoes tripping
Got all these hoes strippin'
No, we ain't P$C, but them bitches know we Tippin
I just bought a pint and ain't none of y'all sipping
Make my friends buy they own
Fuck, I'm tired of being friendly
You ain't gotta lie, just to try to be wit me
Bitches up in heaven, waiting after they die to be with me
I'm crazy for being Wayne, or is Wayne just crazy
I been around, I'm still around, like them Geico cavemen
Hairpin trigger; no, I won't shave it
I spot hip hop in the ocean, I'm gonna save it
The South is so dirty bitch, you can't bathe it
Hollygrove dog, and I feel like mating
Babygirl, your pussy looking so vacant
And it's fuck you and fuck Georgia Bush, not Macon
Fuck Waist Deep, I'm in over my head
But it's cool, I'mma make it, I'm Good like Meagan
Your girl wants me to come Ronald like Reagan
Your boyfriend is softer than the carton the eggs in
I don't fear nothing but God and weddings
At the top of my paper, like I'm starting a heading
My homie Santana, yeah, that's my ace
But you may know us as I Can't Feel My Face

Yeah, Weezy, bitch
Don't give a fuck about you at all
I'm paid, been that way for a long time
Looks like I'mma die like that
Cause if I ain't, I'mma just die

See they don't know where I came from
But they know where I'm goin
And I'mma tell you just how the top feels when I'm on
In the game, I'm no cheetah
I'm a tiger, I'm a cougar
I'm a panther, I'm a Bengal, Ocho Cinco
I'm illie, shirt softer than Gillie
In a pair of Gucci flops
Feeling freer than Willie
When them niggas Left Eye, it got a little bit Chili
But I just let it burn, like the end of the Philly
Weezy

Press a button, watch the motherfucker do tricks
I don't know what you're on, but I'm on some new shit
While your bitch is on my dick like a glue stick
I got a grill, I don't have to get my tooth fixed
The tooth fairy would retire if I lose it
Straight out the clip, that's how I spit, like an Uzi
You can't find me 'cause I'm lost in the music
I'm running this, and I can jump the hurdles
I'm feeling like I'm racing a bunch of little turtles
Keep a bandana like the Ninja Turtles
I'm like a turtle when I sip the purple

Hollygrove 17, I'm from the Zoo Crew
You would think every animal in the zoo loose
But I keep my shit together, not a screw loose
Yeah, word to my Gucc' boots

The shit ain't fair
I didn't have to go there
But all this ice got me feelin' like a polar bear
I'm so aware
I'm so prepared
I'm so fly I will take off into the open air
Liftoff
Cristal

Crackers with cheese
Nigga please

No reggie man

You know I smoke that kush
And I ball like swoosh
Now how you like me now?



Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

I've been having these nightmares
Of losing time, with no reward
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law
Then I went and found time in an Audemars
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more
They say beef is a poor man's sport
Behind the money get that rhyme report, fuck it


I don't cut the work
Drop top on 20's
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penny
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Goin' at your neck, get the rope tie a noose
This a gut check, now who do I write it to?
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery
I'mma God, Mercy Me, I'm higher than mercury
Smokin' on that strong Full of that Hercules
Bartender, Hurry up, Hurry up with my drink
Nigga's pullin caper's like a they come with a string
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink
Cause' I don't know what nigga's thinking, but I know how they think
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw
I'm in that pussy, she in awe
In this here is my homeboy Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw
You can get your head cut off with a saw, yeehaw
Kill you and your right-hand man, Southpaw
Money over bitches, and above the law
Money over bitches, and above the law
Money

Pocket full of money, with a posse full of hitters
Black and White Porsche's, like a Nazi with a nigga
Money make the world, 360
We throw them dolla's up, them bitches better be Frisbee's
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux
Man it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubba
Some nigga's fade away, some nigga's hit the jumper
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't wanna hurt ya baby, we just want your uncle
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer
Than left her, somewhere out wherever
They find your body severed
You know they findin' nigga's guilty like they find the treasure
But get your money
On occasions, I get too wasted, it's an occasion
I heard a nurse say, "Thank you for being so patient"
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder
Turning good to better
Gotta pull it together
I wish that blood on the floor, was rose pedals
Real gangsta's die of old age
And old money, get paid my nigga
Tunechi

Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know

I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Like novacane

You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the World
Sorry I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the doctor prefered
My Friends told me leave you alone
And I just told 'em leave me alone
It's sad our thing had to end
The relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long
And I see her in the streets
But I can't bring her home
Man, I was on her line all day, no phone
Hah. No Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana
And truth is...


Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I never imagined she'd turn out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned to sour, she gave me power
The world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flour
But I had to change, Yeah, I had to change
So I left it for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything's cool, everything's fine
Girl, I'm moving on, I left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time, cause





First degree murder
Beg them, no push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, them strapped with them burner

Real niggas say soowoo
And such and such killed such and such
The streets talk
And bullshit walks
On crutches, but
It's strut to strut
Niggas panic
Button pressing
The end is coming
Count your blessings
We living in the day and time
Where the ten commandments
Are now suggestions
How depressing
How infested
Click-clack, pow; intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses
With tight pussies, I found the crevice
AK bullets move mountains
Break them bitches down to pebbles
That tough talk is like music to my ears
So keep it acapella
Based on a true story
We not worried, y'all too worried
I faced my fears
And told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous
Dread head from New Orleans
Where the youth, them got two choices
Shoot, or get shot, or a nigga choose for you
We murdered them

First degree murder
Beg them no push it further
This a nuh beef we make burger
The youths them strapped with them burner
First degree murder
Beg them no push it further
This a nuh beef we make burger
The youths them strapped with them burner

Yo, Tune point and I'm dusting niggas
I ain't talking lacing no marijuana
Soon as I hatch I reign like a quail
And I don't give 2 fucks I ain't a koala
My uncle gangsta but I make him nervous
All he see in my face is murda
Waste a burna is my waste a furnace
I'm pacing turners your face the thermos
First birthday wish was getting caked up
Shoot a nigga wake up on the wake up
Lay down and a model bitch ache up
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough taped off of this day pub
Race off like some motherfucking make up
Take off looking for something to take up
Want the paper? Or you want in the paper?
Not horoscopes but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga 30 for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much you sneezing dick
Believe in me I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip
It's Young Money till I'm in the freezer stiff
Bitch

First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
The youths dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
The youths dem strapped with dem burner

It's all about the money nigga fuck the fame
Where we come from shots ring nigga broad day
Lil woadie said he had the chance he do the shit again
Pop the pills for the pain but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rapper man the back soaking gang
Cartier frames got them looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard in the rally same?
Lowkey can still get a brick off my name
Now I'mma tell you this here for my youngin and them
The same ones I help the corners with do numbers with
If there ever was a problem watch them pull up quick
Caught an L sticking to the script you know I switched
We now switch

First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
The youths dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
The youths dem strapped with dem burner

You shouldn't call me from your girl's phone
Cause she ain't gonna delete my number
Press me when she know that you're gone
That bitch is gonna hit me right up
And do I still have my own private ring?
Oh, now you keep your shit on silent ring
Damn, why you think I let you keep your diamond ring?
To remind you of when I was king

I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Used to call her from a jail phone
Phone sex 'til it beeps, time’s up
Girl, talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots
Taking beaucoup snapshots, different backdrops
I still fuck that pussy 'til you blackout
Take your tap out, no ceilings

Muhfucka, what you know bout Weezy huh? Holla at me dawg

The Sqad pop 'em I'ma fuck with the hottest
Diamonds droppin’ temperature, bitch I'm one of the finest
And to be honest, I got all these hoes stocked up like sinus, now who you fuckin'?
Ice shining colorful, like a sack of fruit or something
With no heart for bitches like ??? or something
I be the true to nothing thorough nigga, young, raw, and famous
Get money 'til I'm dead or 'til the day of my arraigning
Spittin' game through the platinum smile
You can see the fuck I be saying from half a mile
How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes
Cause all I give is cum to these hoes and run from these hoes
I comfortably roll in the latest sleepy eye Mercedes
Heat up for the haters speed up for the ladies
Miss, so watch your back, and watch your mouth cat
Weezy shit, this our click
You 'bout that? I send my Sqad to where your house at
All of a sudden niggas gs, why the fuck is you trippin'?
I cock and shoot up one of your knees, why the fuck is you trippin'?
You listening? I'm official pimpin'
Be lowkey dippin', Range Ro' be twistin' on blades
I'm O. J. Simpson, pretty limpin'
Big fucking cannon, holding me back
With some shit from off the Discovery Channel on my back
My niggas drowned in smoke, underground, pound daily
My hoes like Nelly cause they go "Down, down baby"
I used to dog chickens, cluck 'em, fuck 'em, and duck 'em
But now I'm more mature, I fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and fuck 'em
Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades
And I'ma make you see the insides like a x-ray
Aww fuck...
Huh? Drunk off Cris', mami on e
Weezy on e, mami cummin' on me
The diamond long links sparkle, tough in the light
You do a lil' something tonight, I buy you something with ice
And I ain't stunting a price, shawty I can afford it
I been had dough before I was recorded
Started to order you a Mercedes C 240
But I thought it would be more nice for you in a Ferrari, peep me

It's whatever, holla

Check it, check it

Muhfucka bet' not fuck with this nigga

And my pistols off my hip but I give a shit about who I hit, fuck
I'm fucked up, I'll fuck you up for fucking up
Guns up like "What's up?", get your fucking guts cut
Tough luck bruh
Wonder why your bitch act stuck up?
Cause the slut got Weezy nuts stuck up in her fucking butt
Yung mack flip crack quicker than acrobats, get at me man
Look call me Wayne a. k. a. Big Daddy Kane
Nigga can't tell me nothing 'bout the game
Been in that deep shit, every year I'm M. V. P
It's just in me
Rims on the 'Lac like 22 inches
Play with me, I open up your back like 22 inches
Guerrilla pimpin'
And it really isn't wise for niggas to start poppin'
At any given time them niggas could start droppin', peep it
I'm off the strip muhfucka what you want?
This a freestyle coming from off the top out the trunk
Niggas be like Mase and go to Church
But I go to the trunk and then I go to your shirt
Holla at me, I'm the don bitch

Gotta get another rap to flow on bitch...
Hold up, aight, aight, aight
Listen, playa, all I do is get bread, I'ma head to them cowards
And if they ever try me, I'll bring y'all the head of them cowards
This big spending, see the heads on them dollars
It's big pimpin', you see your bitch lipstick red on my boxers
Choppers pop at any time for any given reason
Leave 'em not breathing under cement for one disagreement
Freedom, we ride on them bitches, rollin' through sittin' high on them inches
My mission's to make sure Squad get expensive
And if anyone of you niggas better get defensive, your care will get intensive
Shot put humps on top of your head like Bart Simpson
I spark instant, now who want it? I'll light your set
Cause I'm all about money cocksucker, my life a check
I'm spectacular, I let the Tec tackle ya
I spit 16 after ya like I rap with y
Put your chest in the back of ya
You would think a truck hit 'em, it's Weezy, don't fuck with him
Better lock me up or get me to the graveyard quick
Come and get me I spray, spark, spit, it's straight war bitch
Niggas is hoes, like they take long dick
I wave chrome shit at home, shit, make domes split
And may I say these fake niggas on some Ray Charles shit, blind to the fact
9 to ya cap, blat, put your mind in your lap
I ride with the gat for hard times, crimes, and rats
It’s rhymes of the crack, my Sqad, I'll die for that
I climb in the 'Lac, drunk off 190 ?
Don't try me cat, I take this shit beyond the rap
And this Ecstasy is why my eyes are black
Don't like baby moms but the X make her thighs look fat
But fuck the bullshit I grind for scratch, I scrape and scruff, bake and cut
You hatin' us? We tape you up
I spin ya corner make you duck from blazin’ bucks
Bandanas, braids, and cuts, I'm gangsta'd up
Muhfucka

Oh, oh shit, oh shit
What they want?
I dont think they want Weezy. Do you think they want Weezy?
Check it, check it

Lil' nigga pass slow in a S 430, ya ho be like "That's so purty"
Fuck with me I'll show your chest no mercy
Sqad get so dirty, but still we do it clean
Bring action to these fake ass niggas like movie scenes
I pop so much X man I feel like Wolverine
Wake up in the morning, lips burning, can't move my spleen
See this lil' dude is mean, strapped up with tools and things
I'll get you different drugs mixed up like Smoothie King
The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey
I'm so exciting
Money, murder, steal, kill, rape
You should do like the Internet and start to Bill Gates
This whole world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these Cash Money rumors
I'll blast, bust, and shoot you, hit your block without the mask, fucking screw you
Treat you like a bitch, bitch look at me while I do you


Ok, ok, homie, ok
Peep it out, Squiddad
Let me catch my breath, let the Danger track roll
And let me holla at you, now let me holla at you, check it out
S-Q-A-D


Don't fool with any niggas like me
We pull triggers like weeds
Swigger off the Piña Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power
You need a problem? I'm the meanest to start with
And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green
If you intervene I'll leave your ass colder than Winter
And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up
Nigga what up? I just bought a record to say fuck Hip-Hop

Dip cops, flip rocks, and when the bricks drop
We fix blocks, suddenly watch the income
Fuck with me, watch the outcome
Niggas don't wanna hear the Glock rung

See Weezy gets loot, that be why your bitch choose
But dude, I ain't got nothing for her but some dick juice

They gon' have to rescue this fella if he stress my pleasure
I tells you once, I'm the don, you can trust my word
I say with a Herpes dick, nigga fuck the world
I be with niggas that could get me years
I be with hoes and bitches that favor Britney Spears
Listen here, you see the Sqad Minked up, Platinum S. Q. linked up
With a freak that drink nut ‘til my dick shrink up
You think it's soft? Let the thing bust 'til I'm seeing pink guts
Niggas watch them pigs come, they trying to sink us
You know who I be, Weezy Wee muhfucka
I ain't gon' stop the flow until the end
K we got a new game, I'm running, punting, I ain't passing the ball
You other niggas just be crashing the boards
With a team full of great players, but I'm a veteran, all-star
And let's be real man, I'm better than all y'all
I'm the truth, I'm the reason, I'm the meaning, I'm the shit
I'm the alleged convict in any Sqad incident
Last name Carter like Vince and shit
But I don't slam balls and goals, my life's money, cars, and hoes
Cadillac white walls and 'Bauds, pimpin' partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this partna, I'm the young don these niggas honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel
It's cause the child's mom will eat me up like Jeffery Dahmer
Libel to find my condom inside of dry vagina

A minor with intentions to harm ya, holla

Turn 'em against you and make 'em kill ya mom and them, don't fuck with me
Buck 50 on the dash of the box but that's only approximately cause it really do like two ?, blue fire
Wrist looking like blue fire
Piña Colada got me spiked like barb wire, Weezy Wee, Sqad rider
Holla at me, you know you know me

Get down or you dying, niggas tote iron
Got that coke flying like birds, not the ones with feathers, I'm talkin' weight like birds
And you might get served if it’s proper enough
Or find your nerves on the curb if you a cop or something
A baller blocker or something, I'll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprinting, dashing, jogging, and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Sqad property buddy, some young niggas with a mafia budget
Can't nobody put nobody above it
And if they do, they find they body with your body above it
Fuck it, let's take it public, nah leave it the gutter
Fuck it, let's go and dump 'em, nah leave 'em in the gutter

Keep my name out your yapper, or you gon' have to try to keep my flame out your cappa

When I swallow half the Dom I go loco, stressed, hoping I'm not cursed
Walk around with TECs poking out my shirt
Niggas show off for them hoes, try play hard, with they chest poking out they shirt
Try me and I send shots, leave they chest poking out they shirt
Yes, expect the worse when you fuck with the Squad right
Pull you out your car at a stoplight
Catch you in the waist, make you my height
This shit's not nice, I'll have you chopped twice for a hot price
Or I can take off my ice and hit your block and stop life
Can you see that?
Properly under my seat is where the heat at
Directly in your head is where the bullets meet at
I be that cat who make sure my Sqad ball gracious, 'til The Lord take us

My real father is a ho, my attitude is fuck pops
I'm living it up in a nice home, riding in trucks, tough drops
And I'm a young nigga, I don't even know how to do the bus stop
But I got my money right
When I hit the club, make it a sunny night
See the fake flossers, bum ballers, is a funny sight
Watching dudes front for these hoes in they Chevy right?
Pull up next to 'em in a 500 bumpin' Betty Wright
Keep my shit spaghetti tight
Playboy put the hood on that
We buy sports cars and put the fuckin' hood on that

Fee Fee Favorite

Flippin' in a whippa
Peel the top back like a zipper
Skippin' on them chrome dip slippers
Rippin' on the lips of a stripper
If that's your bitch mister don't kiss her
If so you might as well kiss a pistol
Cause all I do is shoot off in her whistler
She finna get my name on her shitter

My nigga Fat did her, and slid her to the rest of the Squidda
Forget her, another bitch just paged in

So all I'm feeling is air on my head
With some ho that you might know, she sucking all the air out my head
Meet you close to knock you square out your head
Sip the Cris’ to clear out my head and try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator ?? coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler
I Come back through the hood with that dirty

Got bitches in they 30's calling Weezy poppa
But Weezy not daddy bitch, cause Weezy in and out ya

Any beefs involving homie, your momma
Homie we swarm out the Eddie Bauer, thoughts to devour
Spark and shower, we get more stupid than Austin Powers
Smell the aroma of marijuana, Coronas when upon us
We do just what the neighborhood have shown us
We murder opponents and don't think about it, forget about it
Niggas won't do shit about it
Wave the pistol, get the bitch up out 'em
I'm off the hinges, chicks on my dick, proper than Cindy Crawford
Any problems I pop the chopper and knock the appendix out him
Hit the block with bricks of powder
What you know 'bout doing that?
And splitting a key with flour, making it two in fact
Dawg I'm all street, if you want Hip-Hop, here's what I give you instead

I wish the cops stay off the corner this week
I wish the gutta, ghetto neighborhood hunger would cease
I wish them niggas who ain't got shit would stop hating on niggas who got shit
And you know I wish for Pun, Biggie, and Pac shit
I wish that I could get high but when I'm high I wish I wouldn't get high
Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive
I wish for Heaven gates to enter
Wish for Lakers' tickets at the Staples Center
My seats, floor me
Wish Chris Childs wouldn't of hit Kobe
When I see Lauren, I wish I knew why my heart burns
Wish 22 inch rims wouldn't rub on sharp turns

Wish hoes wouldn't suck dick and try to kiss down my neck
Wish I ain't have to get locked up for slapping her to the ground for that

Pistols burning
Pop the barrel, turning

We closing any open shop we ain’t concerned in
Coke the size of Sherman Klump we flipped and doubled
And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Bubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move product
And split them niggas quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain’t tryna go that route with the Sqad, it’s rough, I promise
We kidnap your mommas and sit our johnsons on her tonsils
We reside inside the S. Q. bombers
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ‘round us
And to be honest, ain’t nothing for me to do away with you
I be the same nigga that blow a Tre with you
Then let a K hit you

Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist
Or take three to the left side of your face
A multiplatinum artist still riding with TECs and 3-8s
A hustler, you can see the crack residue left on them plates
They fucking with me, I’m predicting death on them snakes

Ride in a Benzy
Fuck it, tryna fire my enemies
Fire a sack, recline back, and feel me

We carry automatic machine objects in jean pockets
And clocks with beams cocked and fuck with me - seeing doctors
The Sqad be in monster trucks with screens and bobbers
Passing green and brown chocolate like John Stocktan
Who stopping these lil’ niggas? Nobody, it’s impossible
Find me in a Benz – aqua blue
Rims colossal dude
And right under the seat’s a Glock or two
Don’t make me pop at you
And got two Hawaiian tropical bitches that will swallow you
People ask me “Weezy, why you do it so big?”
I pop my collar, drop the roof off the 6, then shoot up the bridge
Listen, I’ve had loot since a kid
I ain’t just start having dough
As a matter of fact, I started having dough
I’ma be fancy, send some warnings at folks

Play with him, shots turn him dome into a stadium
Beef with me and my gun immediately bust repeatedly
Unleash this pop one in your bitch Victoria Secre-
‘Atures creepin’ without the lights on
Doo rag, G Nikes on
Hope the choir sing your ass a nice song
Niggas ain’t tryna collide with the Squiddad
It is not wise

Pull out, cock, pop moms
Drop bombs
You niggas ?????????
Sqad bitch, ain’t no replacing me
Come to take shit

We on some mob shit
Some lil’ niggas who seem harmless, but nah bitch
Glocks spit behind anything
Bitch lick anything
‘Cause I got plenty change like Bill Gates’ piggy bank
Got a young pretty thing sitting beside me in the whip
With Limo tints to hide me in the whip
Told mami you can keep your clothes on, I wan’ see where your head at
In other words I don’t wanna fuck, I wan’ see where your head at
You can catch me laid back in the cut with ounces and bundles
Bouncing from hustles, doubt me I’ll fuck you, fuck it
Lounging in bubble
Rocky watch resemble mountains or something
Fronting get your body found behind some mountains or sum’n
Aye, when you fuckin’ with me you fuckin’ with cheese
You fuckin’ with Streets, you fuckin’ with heat
You fuckin’ with Sqad, you fuckin’ for free
You touching your knees
And if you hate, you’ll be lucky to breathe
Now how you like lookin’?
When the double gauge is ???? you get your fuckin’ life token
Despite the business, fuck rap
Picture block on a motorcycle wheeliing
But the Glock ain’t right for kidneys
I don’t like you bitches, I hate you hoes
Date you hoes, bust nuts in your facials hoes
Then replace you hoes, that’s the type of shit that makes you hoes
All the women in this nation hoes

Get it hot like summer was close
I’m hanging out the Hummer with Sos’
Exploding missile Glock ringing at the front of your door like Jehovah Witness’
Sober? Forget it
This C. M. B. thing, I’m over committed
The youngest soldier come with it
Cock back, guns put holes in your fitted
Nigga I told you to quit it
I load it with 50
I blow ‘til it’s empty
The dro and Henny got me lokin’ and limpin’
Ropin’ up when I drink ‘til I’m over the limit
Hoppin’ out the Rover with Semis
Wildin’ out, go straight to your momma’s house
With a rag on my face with more 9s than dialing out
Now who hating?
Niggas cheapskating, underestimating
The heat take him, put him under extra pavement
Some one week in Jamaica, come back with a accent like -

Mind over matter, money over all
The world is on my shoulders
Should I dust my shoulders off?
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls
Fuck the bullshit but just don’t fuck it raw
Man pussy has a pattern and I know where I’m going
And if you got beef I turn it to a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life
I wonder if they'll pay attention if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part
Man I’m fly as fuck, you ain't even next to depart
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art

I'm that nigga, that nigga that nigga, I'm not them niggas
I'm that nigga, that nigga that nigga, I'm the nigga, yeah



Dramatic nigga
Well, alright, here I go
I'm a rapper turned singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal chords, all I hit is c-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin' game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are post game
It's comin' too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, "Yeah, once in a blue moon"
Oops I mean a red moon, I did it again Tune
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I state heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in line, don't be tryna to roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young angel, young lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin'? cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' John B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounded like a trumpet
This for all the strippers cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money come in full circle, get up on my axis
Maybe I'm a kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a 4 in it and appreciate the greatness
Drizzy

P-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie scared, cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm fallin', but up I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter-Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, pent house suite, ya'll order
They take off their clothes and put on my T's
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 G's is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? my niggas so bout it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars baby I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy obviously, pop one at your Ivy Leage
I don't have a rivalry, if so you'll have a casueulty
Oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophe
Oops I meant actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch
Gangsta
See I told y'all it'll be well worth the wait, right?
Dedication 3, Chris fuck with me
C'mon it's Mr. Thanksgiving you're talking about

I think I’m seeing things
When I don’t see a thing
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
I know y’all hear 'em screaming things
Now load up choppers
Point it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring

I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop-pop-pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noxzema clean
Sippin on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine
My nigga

Fuck the world
And may I mention, fuck the world again
But I wanna go around the world
Tune, you down to go around the world again?

I am
And you can trust in a nigga like fam
I’m hitting these licks wit my niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma’am
And I

I just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl
Like, oops you look like my girl’s twin
I sin, I'm bad, I meant "My bad"
I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still

I still been drinking on the low
I never think because I know
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
I’m tippy toeing wit ya ho
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops

I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I’m off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I’m no role model
I’m rollin with models, rollin off pills
I’m rollin over
Whoever's not rollin with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die tryin I wrote Wills
I’m chillin, for the moment
Til I can’t figure out the code
To get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I’m liable to blow your fucking face open

Every bone you could break, broken
If I go broke, every home I could break in, broke in
Pussy look like a steak smokin
Niggas slippin like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
And I stay chokin
Off the straight potent
Til it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked
Nigga you can picture that
Til you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
While you cutting your grass
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going nowhere fast
When you got nowhere to go
Nigga hung em by a rope
Dump em by the boats
Fuck em, adios
Fuck em, I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
“What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?”
I say “Ooh talk dirty, but don’t talk long"
You leave Wayne’s world it’s a long walk home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dialtone
Yeah

Mula, can I get a million
Til the heads or tails
Til I get a full coin
Full fledge, full house
When your friend gon' join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin

And what are friends for
I’m still the boss, don’t get sent for

Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, point 'em out
Where he at, I got 'em
We don't wanna see you back in court

The weed so loud bitches get ignored
Cause I ain't got time to go back and forth
I told that bitch don't question me
Bitch, if you do you asking for it
I’m spaced out like asteroids

Feeling like A-rod after ‘roids
I'm from Prov city

And I’m from New Orleans
The part that’s destroyed



Dro, fuck with me! Yeah
Live from the 504
It's Mr. Crazy Flow
Jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the flo'
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down, it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See, you can smell that I smoke
And yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination
That make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water
Yep, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with
Willy the Squid
L-L-Lilly pad niggas
L-L-Look at the monster
Y-Y-You don't want to crash
Like La-La-La Bamba
See it's me, Roney, and Terry
And my new drop is berry
Watermelon, plum
Just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper
Getting new bucks
And all you new rappers
You're just new lunch
Flow sick
So sick
Need a Doc, yes
A creature
Monster
Like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the tock
Before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock
"Gimme a sec"
In the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm running this bitch, like Eric Bieniemy back
'Cause every time I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out "Where the sympathy at?"
Yeah
If you betting money, baby, him'll be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch, I'm fin' to be that
I walked right in hip hop, like "Where my dinner be at?"
I ate that
And I was like "Where my dinner be at?"
I hate that women lie, so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants
Quiet, neither them that
A lot of bitches want dick
I give a lot of them that
Let's do a pill
I can fuck you for an hour with that
And to the kids – Drugs kill
I'm acknowledging that
But when I'm on the drugs
I don't have a problem with that
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers, biatch
And we aiming right at your fucking collar, biatch

First name Young, last name Stunna
Carter in the office, take notes when I'm talking

I boast cause I'm balling
I'm supposed to be balling
When I'm on the phone with bitches

You ain't satisfied til your son'll be calling
Telling you where to leave the money in the morning
Ok, you want a zombie movie instead
That's when you walk in your house and everybody dead

Catch us at the game sitting on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a lil time out
Pockets too deep, shorty, you gonna have to climb out
Faviana prom dress with your spine out

But uh, I guess I'll go ahead and show these niggas
What to do with one of the beats, mane... listen

I like my seat down low and my window slightly cracked
Ridin' with a bad ho, with her girlfriend in the back
I like to get real high and I never look back
And you don't wanna try me, and don't I look strapped?
I come from the hardest city, ain't nobody fuckin' with it
Got a black-and-gold soul, with a fresh New Orleans fitted
And a collared polo and a pair of Bally Bucks
Young Money, motherfucker, know you worried 'bout us
Cash Money, motherfucker, CMR I trust
Never had my jaw broken, but his jaw I bust
And I probably got your girlfriend on my bus
What happens on my bus, stays on my bus
And that white widow weed out the jar is a must
If you give me a cigar, then a cigar I'll bust
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff
Look ma, I'm tryna make a porno, starring us
Well not just us, a couple foreign sluts
Yeah, we make this some ménage à troisin', y'all in?
I be with Jim Jones and we be ballin', ballin'
Yeah, baby, we ballin', like Rawlins and Spalding
Pint of DJ Screw and that Hawaiian
I am leanin' like a 3 legged lion, climbing
Right to the top of the motherfuckin' mountain.. counting
I'm gonna need me an accountant to count it
Mannie got this fuckin' beat poundin', it's poundin'
But it was just lost, until I found it, I found it
Stole it like a scoundrel, Hollygrove hound it
Put this bitch to sleep, fuckin' right, I night-gowned it
Niggas talkin cheap, tell them niggas, "Pipe down, bitch!"
Bloods in the building, now everybody soundless
Beatin' up this track like a muthafuckin' round-fist
Blind, deaf, or crazy, I'mma spit like a long kiss
I am just a Martian, ain't nobody else on this planet
I know, see I live by my only
Say, where my cheese, nigga? Where my macaroni?
Baby, I get up in dat ass, and act a donkey
Candy on candy, nigga grippin' the grain
See, I'm the only fire that can live in the rain
I am so so New Orleans, like 1825 Tulane
Hahaha.... see, you gotta be from New Orleans
To know what the fuck I'm talkin bout
And if you don't... fuck you
I say what I want, and I don't want nothin'
Cause I got everything, bitch



Weed and syrup is the combination
And the inspiration is you pussy-ass niggas
I just realized y'all can't fuck with me
And you never will, bitch-ass niggas
Weezy F. Baby, believe that
Haha, yeah

I got them 24 inches
Sitting on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping
Bitch, I can't hear nothing
Or I might do the Spurs
Sitting on them Tim Duncans
And in that Lamborghini
I do donuts like Dunkin's
How come every bad bitch
With a pussy wanna fuck him
But I just feed 'em drugs
And just watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was a hundred
And my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet
I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow
I just go
No huddle
Baby girl getting straight dick
No cuddle
You know I'm out this world
I just bought a space shuttle
I'mma put some
D's on that bitch
And these hoes starting to get like
Fleas on my shit
Have you seen her? Who? Nina
She's on my hip
Yellow/white diamonds, call it
Cheese on them grits
You niggas ain't ballin
Real talk
You niggas can't guard me
Two niggas can't guard me
You looking at Jordan
From the side
Like Spike at the Garden
I got the hardest bars
Call me the Warden
Yeah, excuse me, pardon
I break a bitch down
Like Tonya Harding
Bitch, I'm col'
Not dude off Martin
Pockets just fat
Like the Klumps and Norbit
Bitch, I'm fly
Like a magic carpet
And bitch, I'm fresh
Like a pack of Orbit
See, I'mma take it
And go bring it back to New Orleans
And bitch, I'mma shine
In the land of darkness
And which I'mma grind
'Til my stacks is tall as
A wall is
And I'm high
Don't wanna know how deep the fall is
No, I can't come down
And every time I send my girl out of town
I put some keys on that bitch
I'm a certified gangsta
Haters make me nauseous
The money make me anxious
Listen how my words
Are poetic like Langston
Dreads down my back
Like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove
Seventeen, danger zone
So many C-notes
I can sing a song
T-top coupe
Looking like a thong
Your girl love my dick
She treats it like a bong
I don't wanna be right
If gettin' high is wrong
My eyes so low
I look like I'm from Hong Kong
Boy, I got more green
Than the Bishop Don Juan
OK, I'm not a Rookie, I'm a Pro –
Methazine fiend
Make the homies say hoh
And make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian
Man, I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carats
And I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag
Just some Swishers
And a whole bunch of cans of whoop-ass, hah
I'm strapped, like a bookbag
So anyone of y'all can come on
And get a foot tag
D.O.A
Ride all night
Sleep, no way
Sleep when I lay
Six feet deep
And until that day
I'mma be living like it is that day
Yeah, I keep holding on
I said, bitch I been hot
Bitch the stove been on
If you don't like it, I roll over and roll alone
Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on
Yeah, some cool shorts and my Kobes on
Looking slicker than the lane that you bowling on
If they ain't tell you I'm the shit, then they told you wrong
Bitch, I'm bubbling like soda foam
In a styrofoam
You know what's in my styrofoam
What?
S-Y-R-up
That's my car, yup
Vrooommmmm! Errr!
I'm gone

Alligators and rattlesnakes

You understand me

Woke one morning
Tears in my eyes
And you had left me without a kiss or a note
Or goodbye
Now I got to learn to live alone
But my heart can't take it
I guess that's why I wait by the phone
For a call, a call from you
Sayin' she needs me back
Just as much as I need you
But I guess for the time, you need to stay away
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day

I'm thinkin' about you
I'm thinkin' about you

Oops upside your head
I said oops upside your head
I said feet, don't fail me now
White man came down to my city
On the corner
And asked me what do I do
I said, do what I wanna
Said, do what I wanna

I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had
And how we let jealousy
Turn all we had good into bad
Now I realize
If you just try it again
Love will play out
You'll be my girl

Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam

Very concealed, I got whatever you feel
I got blow like Derek Foreal
I got that white like Jaleel
I'm 'bout that life and that's real
I'm 'bout that life and that's real
I say that twice ‘cause that's real
Sometimes it's like I just feel like ain't nothing easy
I'ma get high for that reason
And you could still die for no reason, die for no reason
I just be fightin' my demons
I just be lightin' my cheeba
I just be Tunechi or Weezy

We kill you on sight just for breathin'
'Round here you can die for your Visa
'Round here you can die for a pizza
'Round here we don't die for no divas
And I just be high for no reason
I just be high for no reason
They kill my pop at fourteen
Sometimes a nigga just cry for no reason
'Round here you can die with your homie
'Round here you can die by your lonely
We come on your side for no reason
Shoot it up and then smile when we leavin'

You could still die for no reason
I be getting high for no reason
The world it be tryna get over
I be getting high to get even
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no feelings
And you all in your feelings
I'm like, "Fuck your feelings"
You know I ain't got no ceilings

Ima call this here... real rap
Cause this rap is real... ya know?
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know you ain't never too live to die
Listen

I grew up where them people called them people on us
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Livin' like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they put cement on us
Ghetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us
So we got the names writtin on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitch ass police canines, teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy roll the L
Beezy ain't here... where's Beezy at?... Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back wit my nigga
But I know thats how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin my nigga
But now they all rappin, my niggas, so now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sail boat flappin my nigga
No fingas I'm snappin', happy for my nigga Lil' Tiggas
Cause even though we couldn't, The Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Found his body like a month later, Rest in Peace boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wesy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin, and I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow
So if I cry dont stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
My nigga Lil' Derrick is quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his mama fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can, thank God I had dreams of being the man
And fuck a man with a badge
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The five o killed naughty good boy dead
Man you woulda thought they killed corn bread
Shot 'em up face down on the lawn
Not to mention with his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But don't nobody do nothin' bout it
The jailhouse and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And haters at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod
Shit and they tried to burn my phantom up
But I got my gun license, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stay still mothafucka I'mma have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
And you can put that on my late father
Or my late grandmother, Ms. Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather Larry Bosock
The old man hustle 'till his heart stopped
And all I know 'bout my real pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off wit a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
But thats why when I see him I acts mad funny -
Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama how it's suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope for me
And I don't ever want to see her mope for me
Hopefully, but truthfully there is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray it's as far as the future sees
You are listenin' to the future Wee-zy F. Baby
Amen



Smoking on strong, money long, we don't reason
Probably with my niggas, but my bitch Polynesian
Met this bad little broad, she was curvy
Sipped out in the middle of the day, I started early
Balling in the middle of a drought, we ain't worried
Middle finger up to the judge and I'm smirking
Bring your squad cause you know my gang with me
Drop the top on the car, let the tits breathe
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds snatching

Commas, commas, commas, commas, commas cashing
We fight time and time and time and time and time and time

No homies
Honest
You niggas is harmless
I’m calm as
A Don is supposed to
Cosa Nostra
Don’t ever approach him
Don’t get close to him
Shootouts ain’t nothing but rock-n-roll to him
Leave your blood on the dash, call it rosewood
‘Nother murder, ‘nother page out the notebook
It ain’t nothing, and don’t make it if you no good
I tried to talk to him
But then a nigga had to

Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up
Really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock
Put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him
I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up
Fuck it make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof

Take them shoes off your teeth
Stop runnin’ your mouth
No shoes, no feet
I’ll run in your mouth
I’ll come to your house
Me and my goons
Loading up bangers
Riding under the moon
Throwing up fingers
Saying “My side rule”
If a nigga disagree, that’s when my side prove
That Maybach Coupe a cock-eyed fool
And I’m “in it like Bennet” ho, aren’t I cool
But if the thermostat switch
And that needle move
Then the attitude switch
And that heat’ll move
I got that Chiquita banana
Clip for the tool
Meet a disaster
Pity the fool
Eat a catastrophe
Swallow the truth
Belch reality
How does it taste
Powder your face
You a bitch nigga
All pussy
Stop coming out your lips nigga
I tried to talk him
But then a nigga had to

Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up
Really I was tryna be calm

I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em, but I hit ‘em up
I tried to talk to him
I tried to talk to him

Real talk, boy
Chill with the talk, boy
That Tommy gun’ll tear your neighborhood apart, boy
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart, boy
Start with the wrong boy
It end with a song, boy
With your friends to carry you along
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone
Fuck the discussion, I ain’t into it boy
I just get to it
Let’s do it
Rip through a boy
Big Uzi, just shoot a boy
I’m inside looking out, you just an intruder boy
You need sutures on your smoochers boy
But, I tried to talk to him
But then a nigga had to

Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up
Really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock
Put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him

Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up
Fuck it make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof

Michael Phelps, this for you, baby!

I'm goin for the gold, my heart is in control
My mind is on succeed and I am in the lead
Don't buy into the schemes, the science or strategy
Just giant N-U-Ts brings triumph and belief
I'm a lion or a dean, inspired by the green
Never tired or fatigued, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I'm lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things; I'mma die as a king
If I don't do it now, I'mma try it again
And when I do accomplish it, I'mma try it again
I'm a riot, insane; I'm a lion, my mane
Hangs down to my strings and they're tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain, I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane; besides, we're the same
Who's guiding the train? Who's flyin' the plane?
Who's driving the lane? Who dies when it bang?
Who fires when it bang? Who lies in the aim?
Two lives in the drain; who crys when they sang?
You hide but you can't; you high but you ain't
I advise you to think; you'll find what you can't
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank
Combined with my strength, my time and my length
I'ma iron out the kinks; yes, I'm on the brink
And in the eye of my wink, I'mma retire in the bank

Yeah, and I'm no quitter
Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

Victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy's misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively; you can't harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually; you'll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of "this is what you did to me"
Nothin's what you did for me, nothin's what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visualing, now break all of the limiting
Now shake all of the gimicking, the fakery, the trickery
"Nurse, how sick is he?" "Worse, I am sickening!"
I'll be at the finish line first, "how quick is he?"
I'mma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain't with the bickering, I am full of dignity
I am full of energy, pull out the inner me
Or bull after dinner meat, I stood in the winter heat
It could be the end of me, but good be defending me


I'm allergic to cheatin'
I hate failure and I'm in love with achievement
Above and beneath it, a hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize and I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin', begun with the preachin'
Now pray, until I am one with the deacon
Now play, until I have won whatever we win
I play, until I have won, and then I re-win




Look, look, look

A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin rie
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and Glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waistline
Duckin the law, cause I ain't tryna' do no Fed time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Janae and keep Macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this

Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' bills

Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The Feds said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And whole family deny me of what I do cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin' away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
We keep fightin' but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck


I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'mma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all'a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world




I pop some Percocets
Then I pop some Xanax
Sitting back strapped, cocked
Plotting on your man next
Jack a nigga for his work
Then stretch it like some Spandex
He hesitate, I spray and leave him
Like a Tampex - oops, I meant a Tampax
Bitch, I keep that anthrax
I can get your man wacked for a couple tan packs
Shoot off your Sedan Lac
Nigga, I demand stacks

Bitch, I be spraying Macks
All type of guns with accessories
I'm like Cosby for the bills
I need mills like Stephanie
Pussy niggas can't stand next to me
I've got dope and ecstasy
Keep em floating like both of the levees breached
Eighties baby but my soul from the seventies
Worldwide game like a traveled the seven seas
Niggas ain't OG, scary lil bitch, please
Put your pussy in the pan, Friskies

I got ten up on my pinky ring and twenty on my bracelet
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can't say shit
I'm just here to separate
The real from the fake shit
I told you, I was coming in
I'm sorry for the wait
I gotta get this money man
It's right here in my face
I got the Devil on my back
I don't wanna be up in that place
My grandmom tell me to be safe
I just keep running in these streets
I can't stop fucking with these hoes
When I say I'm just doing me
Bitch, I'm a Ninth Ward nigga
Mason street, D & G
That Florida right by the D
Need to free my nigga B
I ain't the type of person to be
Running from no beef, those fucking guns
Are gonna be bursting, knock somebody
Off their feet
So watch your fucking mouth
Before you end up on that floor and stop
Acting like you're hard cause
You know you've been a ho
I told you out the gate I'm not the fake
I gotta say, please excuse
Almost forgot man, I'm Raw Dizzy by the way

Money over bitches, bitch I'm coming for the check
Vampire living, bitch I'm coming for your neck
Raw, I'm sharp, my swagger like an X
I'm a motherfucking monster, I rap like I'm possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold that down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be riding with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler the Creator
I'm an Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woop'n
They went brazy when they heard I had a song with Lil Tunechi
Bitch, get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer, I'm the one who be
Producing my music
I'm a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot
Cock the semi
Drop you like an Otterbox
They sleeping on me like I'm rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking

All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Didn't I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sonny drive in Bronx Tale, Calogero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull them hammers out and run them nigga's like stockings

Thugga, Dizzy, Flow
Sorry for the Wait, coming soon, Carter IV, beyotch

I'm just, staring at the world
From a Cadillac window, baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience
And she said "Bravo"
And I said "I know"
And she said "Encore"
Girl, I'm really big on you
So what you wanna do?
Too fly you need a parachute
But that just means you're falling in love

In love with a skater
Five six seven, man, I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug
Shorty got me open
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Where your mans at?
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Hey, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass


Girl you gon' make me take you
To your desired destination
Left leg, right leg, segregation
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something
And she so fine
From the front from the side from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine




Face ass
No Ceilings, hah!
No Ceilings
Yeah, No

I'm standin' at a table full of choppas nigga
I'm sippin' on the maple, Aunt Jemima nigga
And trust me, nigga, you don't want no drama nigga
Cause I swear we all nuts, John Bobbitt nigga, woah
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't gnarly nigga
Yeah you see us, we just skatin', you just fallin' nigga, woah

She tryna put this money in her stocking
She kinda thick as fuck and got some knockers, woah
My niggas really Blood, and you just spotting whoa
We all over the bread like a Sloppy Joe
And when I'm in the pussy I'm a boss
Knock her off
My enemy don't cross the line I draw
Respect my art
Man I swear to God
These pussies soft like a moth
Weezy baby, diaper off
Different cloth
Different thoughts
Sippin' syrup like it's broth
Life is short, tart
Fuck his bitch, whip his kids, drive his car
I'm grindin', tryna stack a hundred commas
Just popped a combo, I ain't talkin' bout McDonald's, woah

I'm standin' at a table full of choppas
I'm standin' in the Maybach cause it's topless
I'm standin' at a table full of options
Different bitches, different flavors, different toppings
And we ain't got no traitors in our posse
And really I'm just wavy and I'm saucy
And really I'm amazing and I'm awesome
My whole squad lit, nigga, arson
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't gnarly nigga
If you ain't been to Vegas, you ain't party nigga
Shout out to Lil Capito and Marley nigga
I've been fuckin' with them since Atari nigga
And me, I'm a lil 504 New Orleans nigga
I be in 305 though like a Marlin nigga
And Hoodie, he from Texas, bitches boppin' mane
And since I met him, I ain't ran out of drank

When we leave H-Town it's in a fish tank
Glass house Chevrolet, you can see everything
Bad bitches with cocaine nose rings
Give it up to real niggas and expose lames
Cold game got me in the Mulsanne
Killin' these streets, audio drug slang
If you don't collect Ferraris you ain't poppin' nigga
You could learn Italian in my driveway bitches
If it ain't OG I ain't coppin'
Don't smoke, we just throw it in the garbage
Them niggas ain't tough, they just talkin'
Outchea after dark them niggas targets
Horror movie writer, I be with the monstas
Trill surround us, you might not make it out 'em
Phone calls in the morning say they found him
Whole hood wanna see what y'all gon' do about it
Rolled up on the front porch
At my grandma's house watchin' Blood Sport
Through the screen door
What you know about gunshots? Ever seen war?
I've really seen more than I talk 'bout, nigga
Stuntin' on streets you're scared to drive down
Our town, children be firin' live rounds
Hug the ground cause the shit gettin' serious
Fuck around, get killed unintentional
While I'm outchea eatin', nigga, Whole Foods
Rollin' up straight gas, fresh produce
I'm the guy that you go to, criminal smooth
Digital moves, triple the loot
Hopped on the phone, called the lot, "Gimme the coupe"
I thought of Tune, called back, told him, "Give me two"
That's what I do
If you ain't got no Daytons you ain't poppin' nigga
One time for my lowriders hoppin' nigga



Now this is what they've been waiting for
Ya dig, Santana
Weezy F
Ay Wayne
What up man
What you been workin' on nigga?
Oh you know, I got Curren$y's new album
And prolly workin' on my album, ya dig
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga
That's what it is
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together
That's that "I Can't Feel My Face Shit" they know that
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did

I'm feelin' like a black Republican
Naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Toccara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high
Higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
Its get rich, go to jail or be a murder victim
Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

I feel like a black Republican
Tote the MAC in the public and
Act so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money, money
Like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politic
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the end. I
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be

I feel like a black Republican, drug money comin' in
I'm a volcano filled with lava about to erupt again
I stay with the iron, don’t make me plug it in
Stay outta rich kids' business, don’t be buttin' in
I stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it
Forget a tongue, she put a lung on it
My Listerine come out, she start guzzlin'
I’m above you dudes, I’m hoverin'
Juelz, why you duckin' them?, Duckin' who?
I’m in the hood like, “What it do?", comfortable
And believe me, it's nothing to
Send my London boys to English muffin you
You poodles barkin' too much they bringin' muzzles through You ain't gully, you gullible
They need love, they need hugs
They need church, Jesus! Could it be 'cause
And we up, this is just a sample, yeah, a free drug
The shipment is in, we done re'd up
But, I don’t trust dudes, like a prenup
They cockroaches, they gotta be bugged
I’m ballin' for real, you gotta D up
I don’t hear you boys, you gotta speak up
What are you guys saying?
I have the chauffeur hold the umbrella over my head when it's not raining

And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
Recognize or step aside, ya dig
We let the music talk, Drought 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back
It's Weezy!
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards cause you can't face yourself
Assholes
DipSet for life
Cash Money, whaddup
Young Money



I turn around, I was staring at chrome
Shotgun watches door, got security good
Jumped right over counter
Pointed gun at, wink, he tell her
"I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter"

My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "shooter!"

So many doubt cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out
Bang! Die bitch-nigga die! I hope you bleed a lake
I'mma play x-ray, helping y'all see the fake
I'm just trying to be the Great, trying to get a piece of cake
Take it off of your plate, eat it right in your face
They got a whole lot to say but I don't listen
Call me Automatic Weezy, bitch, I keep spittin', pow!

All these bitches and, all these bitches!
But ain't no lovers around
They thinking about shooting! Them shooters
Got the guns, girls. Ladies, them gunners that
Shoot shoot shoot shoot! Shooters!

My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "shooter!"

And to the radio stations, I'm tired of being patient
Stop being rapper racists, region-haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick-takers
It's outrageous! You don't know how sick you make us
I want to throw it up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern, face it
If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics

Lady walks into a shotgun surprise
Dropped to her knees, saw her life before her eyes
I'm your - shooter!"

My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "shooter!"

Socks soaking wet, I been running y'all
I reload every hundred yards, I'm comin' forward, you better know me
Lil Wayne, just call me Lord, hard
Take pain like Tylenols, raw
Way past par, far, I'm some shit you never saw
I take you to the shootout, baby, win, lose, or draw
And then they ask who, when, where, how and
My reply was simply, "Pow!"



What, wha, wha, wha, wha

Cash Money Millionaires

You can catch me in an aqua range, squatting things
With them twenty-two inch chopper blades
Diamond face, diamond brace

Catch 'em solo, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way
And let B.G. ease down the shinin' linen
Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up
You don't wanna put your vehicle next to us
Cause all of our vehicles, we dress 'em up
With television, Dreamcast, DVDs
Nice sounds, buttons, it's twenties
I'm a Cash Money Hot, Big Tymer nigga
That'll hold a pinky finger up and blind ya nigga


I'm a stunt 'til I die, so you better respect it
Cause whoever try testin' is gonna be resting
I'm a young millionaire, Hot Boy, Lil' Turk
Nigga like me stay in the cut twenty-four/seven
Steady stacking my ends on dubs, twenty-four/seven
Every car you wish you had, we got it, we got it
Bentleys, Hummers and Jags, big bodies, big bodies
Love to floss, no secret stunners
Niggas steady baller block, can't take nothing from us
Young nigga, living a life surrounded by ice
Hoes be like, "Damn, them boys, they're nothing nice"
They on fire, that must be them Hot Boys

I'm the best just listen, I ain't what the game been missin'
That's my nigga Juelz, I been here since twelve
Ten shells, let 'em save themselves
Fuck them niggas and they pals, pal, pow!



Since I've lost you I'm lost too
Niggas feeling like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart too
God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin that you forgive me
Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney
I don’t want to advance
Give me back her hands give me back her touch
I don’t ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked, I admit I fucked, but everybody fuck up
Now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don’t give a fuck
Cuz um, I'm from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was a soldier
I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster. Bang

You've been hiding, never letting it show
But there's something that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fights
You can’t tell me you don’t remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she’d be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I can bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap


But I hope u haven’t forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why " Ma you even went and got a tear drop like me "
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you baby
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don’t worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream. Damn


I shed tears ‘cause I'm told that they’ll heal
To tell the truth I don’t know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it’s Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room I'm laughin, cause it’s lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?


Flippin' through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin' pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g’s in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my one-liners rule these dynamers
Smellin' Rosé on my breath, an ex-brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin' lavish stackin' mail up
Clothes come from big n tall …………?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get fifty collect calls from dawgs behind bars


Fortune and fame are pleasures you couldn’t fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin ‘em mighty daily
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way bout anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success





What’s happening? Come on man
What’s up with these niggas man?
Yeaahh
Nigga Millz with that New York shit man
One time for my nigga T in this bitch
Yeah, tired of these niggas me

I can make her do tricks
Make the bitch do splits
Write your name on a bullet like a gift
I’m Saint Nick
Overdosing off the dough
Comatosing on the low
Keep my hands on some coke
Like Guns n’ Roses, rock n’ roll
The guns we tote is not for show
Welcome to the murder show
Welcome to the murder capital
That’s capital NO
That’s New Orleans
It’s you or me
If that’s so, you gotta go
You drop the gun
I drop the world

You drop the soap
Rep that soowoo dada-do

These lil boys don’t want no war
Them toy soldiers, G.I. Joe
Mystical
Here I go, here I go
Vehicle, Diablo
All black, white seats, piano
Yeah you're from Santiago
You don’t want no fiasco
We don’t do Donnie Brasco
And tell your crew I said let’s go
Tell your crew I said leggo

Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya

All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is solid
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gon pop it
Everyday I be floating, forever on autopilot
If that nigga ain’t got my money though
Wrap him up like a mummy though
Regular wolves howl at the moon
My wolves come out when it’s sunny though
My niggas ain’t got no words with police
You tell the cops what they wanna know
This shit right here is my dummy flow
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though
Your girl a jumpoff, I holler "Geronimo"
Slam in that pussy like dominos
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows
What you think Weezy signed me for?
Stayed down and I’m still down
True definition of loyal
My style timeless, my style vintage, Crown Royal
From birth to now, heart Big like L, Notorious, and Pun
I want what I deserve, and some
Yeah I’m ballin’ - And 1
All my niggas outside with me
All my niggas down the ride with me
And every freak that that I ever meet
Gotta fuck my girl if she slide with me
That’s word

Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya

We kick down the door, said it before
We did not come round to play games with you niggas
They say you nobody til somebody kills ya
Well I’m bout to make you a famous lil nigga
No game in this killer, murder he wrote
Can get life behind bars with these murderous quotes
The flow is like meth, it’s like crack, it’s like heroin
Yes I am spitting this dope
I am the future, I’m seeing right through you
I’m so New Orleans but I do not know voodoo
My piece will come face-to-face with you like Oovoo
Have niggas searching for you like it’s Google, I’m brutal
I’ve been slept on for a long time
Been patient for a minute, now I want mine
I hear a lot of niggas talking down
I’ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don’t shine
Can’t rhyme in a cypher like this
I’ve been rockin with the best
They don’t put me on the list
I’m an underground king
Underrated in the streets favorite
Every street corner gonna speak bout this
Rest in peace Pimp C
Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman
Yep, lean on me
Like Wu Tang, cash rules everything around me
You know I got the cream on me
Gun barrel smoking like hydro
Middle fingers up, fuck five-o
Still repping B's like a H-town nigga
When I’m finished in this bitch call Geico
You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible
Killin’ everything fuck rivals
Hundred round drum on the stick
When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro

Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya



I tell her "now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

I tell her "go on! Pop that pussy for me"
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about "I" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses
They say "choose wisely" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!


Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at
That's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats
Red bottoms, spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks
Speakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne, order Moët
Rollin' airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin', I tell 'em "perate"
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Let's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it




No Ceilings 2
No Ceilings Dos
No Ceilings Bisexual, that means two
Freaky! Here we go

Tunechi in the building
His house ain't got no ceiling
These hoes, they catchin' feelings

Get that bitch right, nigga
Step up to the mic, nigga

Tunechi
Gun under table
Hand on the Bible
My homies homicidal
You dead on arrival
I'm tatted up, I'm tribal
And I'm duckin' trial
I used to throw my money away, now I recycle
Shout out to the Vice Lords, and to Disciples
That's that gang talk, you need subtitles
We sendin' Scud missiles
Your bitch in love with us
We simply mud sippers
More cane than a cripple
Look I am nobody, 'cause nobody's perfect
Abracadabra, I make a ho out a virgin
I treat her like a servant
Thanks for your service
I'm cold like sherbet
Got it sewed up like a surgeon
It's me and Mannie Fresh back together, bitch we mergin'
The jokes on them and we smirkin'
Man fuck them niggas, they hurtin'
She deep throat like a serpent
I stole out too many purses
Got too many bitches flirtin'
It's No Ceilings 2, curtains

Tunechi in the building
His house ain't got no ceiling
These hoes, they catchin' feelings
We 'bout to make a billion
Stop that bitch
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga

Mula, baby!

Waiting for me after my show
So no time for groupies
Straight to the top floor
Fresh out the shower
A smile and a towel
Then, after an hour
She gon' need another shower
When, I'm at home
In my coupe
Or in the office
Or the streets of The Boot
I'm thinking 'bout you
And most of the girls that come by are cute
And they try to holla, but they all on mute
And my old girls turn they face up at me
Yeah they throw they purses and they make up at me

She done cleaned the whole house
Washed the dishes and the clothes
And when we out
We do it just how we supposed
Look good for the public
Leave the drama in the Rolls
Royce
Choice of car that we move in
She gets high sometimes
'Cause I'm always doin' it
You hear them hallways
We always doin' it
Work cut
Every time feel like the first one
Perfect
When a nigga stressin' at work
She take away all of the pain
Make it lesser than dirt

The best rapper alive since the best rapper retired



So "Little Wayne," what's your motivation?

Is that really a question?
Do you really have that written down in your notepad?
You should be ashamed of yourself
You smell me girl
I smell like money
To me it was always get money or die
I come up under Birdman, the Number One Stunna
You know what I mean I'm Stunna Jr. thats all I know thats all I ever knew
Get money or get nothing you know what I'm saying
And I feel that way
Foreal

So hard I go I keep pushing
The game so crazy I'm in it like deep pussy
I got chip from trying to get the whole cookie
Used to make a thousand dollars everytime I played hookie
Dwayne Carter absent keep looking
I'm present on the block
I'm a legend on the block
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch
Yea nigga I done dropped one eleven on the watch
So watch and see what I do

Weezy F Baby, now the 'F' is for FEMA
Sick nigga bitch I spit that Leukemia
Yea no cure no help
So me so good so hard so felt
Feel me

And that's just my point right there
That's what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me you know

So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period?

I mean, I would say the voice of the hood cause thats who I speak for
And myself, you know what I mean, my family thats who I represent
My homies, my girl, my life you know

C'mon, bang this shit nigga pump my shit
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that bitch
You gotta aim that shit and straight bust that shit
Like motherfuck them niggas what they wan-do I'm ready
Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo
Fucking with the boy baby that's a gamble
If he won in Vegas leave him on the crap table
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable
Like nobody make a sound where the paper where the paper
Gotta get it gotta have it
Once I got it I'mma spend it
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it
The re-ups be like birthday parties
No room to park the cars in the garages
So outside the cribs all you see is arayis
If I ain't say it right fuck it I ain't foreign
Feel me

And see thats where everybody get me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, foreal

Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?

Thats because they ain't got that heat rock like me you know what I mean
They ain't spitting like me
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds
I got the flu over here man, foreal
I need relief, y'all help me
I know y'all sick of me, cause I'm tired of y'all foreal

And based on the bank, I'm doing much better than alot of these niggas
I'm tired of these niggas
Yawning when I see them make me stretch and pull the burner
I'm cocking back and passing
They catch 'em in they sternum
Ooh ooh that gone probably burn ya

I know what's at the store cause I go more, I go forth and so forth
Mami say she so bored with old boy, uh oh
I leave that pussy so sore, that's right no doze
Bitch get lost in the current how the dough flows
Niggas call Maybachs lo-lo's
Nigga got the Glock in a choke hold, I won't fold
To the cops, to the po-po's, ya'll hoes
Shout to my stompin' ground, Hollygrove
Fuck with them New Orleans niggas, funeral
Uptown, Uptown's where I rose
Yea, welcome to the real outdoors and of course
That chopper that I tote will split 'em like a divorce
Then the spiritual force, take 'em way up North
They say the end is comin', I'mma stay up for it
I'mma chase that money, you can wait up for it
I'm a kick to the snare, I'm a boom to the bass
What more can I say? I can't feel my face

Deal up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
I'm a dealer, dealer, I bring it back all the time
That coke, that hard, that crack, oh God
You get caught, you can't give back no charge
Nigga mouth slow-leakin', air him out, no charge
That's free, no prod, that's "G code" ya'll
So, no more slow-leakin, now he just got a flat
Flatline laid on his back flat, halftime
In the crib playin EA sports
They in the streets till the D.A. see they corpse
Plus the chickies know I stay fresh till my tippy toes
Matter fact gimme those whole three rows
Gimme that, matter fact gimme that rack
Cash laid, tab paid, I'm out
I'm off to the valet, where's my car? thank you

The whores know I let my balls sag also
She can't take the dick, I tell her put a sock in it, bitch take the dick
Stroke, stroke see if she can take the dick
Now see if she can take the brick, you on the team now
Meanwhile, I'm in the kitchen doin' my daily routine
Scale a few things, cook a few O's, let my bitch bag 'em
Give it to my workers, let the strip have 'em
Fiends go berserk for the work I'm chefin'
Fiends go to work after the work you sell them
They know they gotta buy more, they head hurt they eyes sore
You're selling that cheap rock, sheet rock, dry wall
They don't want that, they come back for more
But they come back to me, they don't come back to y'all
I be chef, the chef you neva have to re-chef
When I chef, comprende? rewind, reset, replay, action
I be chef, the chef you never have to re-chef

Yea, Santana, Dipset
Weezy F.Baby, Cash Money

Ain't that a dog for ya, some chicks like flees, you gotta use ya paws to get em off of ya
And in the streets you can't get caught trippin, caught slippin, gotta hustle gotta get in were you fit in
Hope you know how to make a dollar quicker then you spend it

Hey, yeah

On ball and chain
I threw the key in the drain
I'm like a ki in a drought
I spent a G on these frames
But my vision is priceless
Seeing through you niggas
Like a fuckin' psychic
Hearing through the grapevine
Niggas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift
Man you better be Pathon
Boy the heat's on
They making peace bonds
I'm in this bitch throwing up the "17th" sign
Straight frowns, no daps
Strapped three times
A Tec-11, AK-47, one Beretta
Ready for whatever
Tell them pussy niggas come together
Heavy better, nigga
Super-soaker wet a nigga
Six feet under flowers
You ain't nothing but a petal, nigga
I'm just a little nigga
Trying to be a civil nigga
30 years old, shit
That'll be a given, nigga
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listening
But she ain't really tripping
'Cause the pots is pissed in
Them niggas trippin'
Until the shots whistlin'
Hear them bullets hissin'
Like a cobra at attention
I got a bitch, and quit calling women bitches
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind, I gotta get it
I'm admitted to the game, true player, no quittin'
There you go shittin' on the way a nigga thinkin'
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
And since the future ain't promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Trade in the tidal wave, this is the ocean
Stand in that heat 'til the motherfucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope
Let 'em tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless
Rats and roaches
Running 'cross the porch
In the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it
Automatics in motion
We banging for the bread
Nigga, even the molded
I got my loaf
I got my toast
Chaperone of the South
I got my coast
Yeah, and until I die
I'm the Best Rapper Alive



Birds flying high you know how I feel
Birds flying high, you know how I feel

Smoking all day drinking on hard liquor
I stay high, even higher than a star nigga
Im on silver haze what is you chiefin?
Im in the coupe keeping the rest of the birds sleeping
And I'm high to the tip top
And I'm twisted with a slip knot
Tangled in the grip-lock
And will I ever stop? never that
Light it up bring it back
Bring a ounce not a sack
I got it foggy as a suana in the building
Looking for ur boy, im probably crawling on the ceiling
Fallin on the railing catch me im gone
Im in another zone but trust me im home
Where the blunts be thicker than the arm
Every time I cop a roller, me say, "This one is the bomb"
You know I gotta explode

Nasty as I wanna be but nasty as you like me to be
I hope you like me too, but now you know I like you too
Three A.M. room..service...serve ya

You might see me in a Bentley painted royal blue
With the white interior on a set of 22's

I'mma jalapeno boy, hot as Cayenne pepper
I'm from New Orleans City, but I’ll take her to wherever
I'm tougher than leather, I'm smoother than Suede
Always never broke, ‘cause I'm usually paid
Got the Rover with the cage kinda brown, off beige
Everybody look at me, like I'm riding on stage
Gotta woman named Sage, she twice my age
Every time she hit me up she send a picture, with a page
I ain't tryin’ to fall in love, I ain't tryin’ get engaged
You can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead
Every time I'm tryin’ to leave she beggin’ me to stay
And I politely fade away like my name was M.J
And she wrote me a note, guess what that note says?
Well, I hope you still like me but I go both ways
And then I say Oh, then I say Okay
Stabbed them up and got the fuck like my name was O.J
If you lookin’ for some money bitch my name is no way
Not tomorrow not today, not yes-terday
I'm Mr. President as they say
And that Phantom fits me like it’s tailor made
I can take on a war, nigga bombs-away
I been in the water fucking all the Marmalades
If you lookin’ for some money, bitch my name is no way
Not tomorrow not today, not yes-terday


Last week I met a bitch, but I forgot her name
Short sweet, red cute, ole vibrant thang
She got a earring in her pussy, ‘n’ everywhere else
She said she jog everyday so she can cum on herself
Then she tell me my love is the best she's felt
And she sucked my dick like it’s about to melt
She drink Vitamin Water, say it’s good for her health
She can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt
Then there’s another bitch, her name was Ayesha
She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time it was so good, I told her to order one mo'
She said it’s not Domino's -- its DiGiorno's
There’s another bitch I met her at the gong Show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
I can't forget about my bitch named Meaty-boo
She’s a young project bitch, I used to bring that hoe to school school
So I brung her to the school  we standing on the yard
The bitch asked me if I was from the 17th ward
Niggas came out the cut and started muggin’ me up
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck
And I told my old lady "I’ll be back, you see" and hit me up on my cell phone
If niggas lookin’ for me, cause


Now chicks gotta ride, twerk, jerk, giddy up
Jump, bounce on the dick and get the fuck, get the fuck
Chicks gotta ride, twerk, jerk, giddy up
Jump, bounce on the dick and get the fuck, get the fuck
My name is Lil Weezy, they say I'm off the heezy
And I tell the dog ho, don't-dont you be greedy
My name is Lil Weezy, they say I'm off the heezy
And I tell the dog ho, don't-don’t you be greedy
Don’t don't you be greedy, don’t don't you be greedy

‘Cuz its Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat on a dog hoes

Dedication 2
Straight from the Carter 2
So much money off the Carter 2
So much money off the Carter 1
So much money ‘cause I'm Birdman son
Don't hate, don't hate, don't hate
I'mma good lookin’ rapper I ain't tryin’ to stunt



Yeah yeah yeah it's the Carter motherfucker I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker
Let me show you my building man, it's the Carter
I'mma show y'all the ins the outs, the ups the down, know what I'm talking 'bout
This is me, fourth solo album baby, I came back around
By myself this time, back off the wall
Guns up in the air in the middle of the street like bang, bang, bang bang, welcome

This is the Carter y'all welcome, hard as Malcolm
Dark as The Falcon, Lord help him, but y'all felt him
And that make you a part of me and pardon me
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughta be
Doing, recording me, I'm just acting accordingly
I give orders to the commander in chief, just the commander in me
Handling streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slandering me I just hand 'em to P
Any drama I pace it like Indiana, I take your grandma pacemaker and just hand her the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want angus, USDA prime beef, you're dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one starting to heat up
Got Mannie hot with me cuz I always beat his beat up
Y'all cats wit y'all feet up starting to look like V'd up, I'm G'd up
On the re-up up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speaking about no speakers
Whats leaking up out of you're speakers is the speech of Weezy F. Baby
Front door, living room young nigga switching weed
What you need? Get you crack, get you weed
Make your way to the back, look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom giving head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doing it
Then he tried to ruin it
But I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker
And the feds know just what's in this motherfucker
Made niggas so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that, let's keep it movin, on to the kitchen where my witches keep it brewing
Uh huh, look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked, look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from promethazine to Metamucil
I'm crucial don't mean to spook you
But this is New Orleans so my queens do voodoo, ya know
So the things just move through
I feel your pain I got things to soothe you
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution, fucker

I came back around, it's the Carter
Show you the rest of the house later
We gonna go upstairs, ya know
You know what this is right
The Carter, the Carter, the Carter



Yeah, Ok I'm strapped
Get 'em
Black Hat, black shades, black diamonds
Oh Behave
No he can't with the fucking seats back
Got the paint job coke
And the fucking seats cracked

I'm a d-boy
Bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the rov for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket
I got money in my block
I got the money and the power

Thinking of a master plan
I get money, but I'm thinking of a faster plan
I'm trying to cash it in
I got five in that garbage can and the wrap saran
I need cash advance
See, I know three sold
The other two a jam
I'mma sit on one and whip the other one much as I can
Hot-ass fuckin' sedan
Windows rolled down, no sound
Them bricks got the speakers drowned
I ain't listening for shit but sirens
I ain't trying to get to my ships sunk, fuck you pirates
I'll touch you cowards
It ain't nothing to a boss
The niggas in the hood trying to floss and your head gotta cost, nigga
Take a loss nigga
SS 55, all black, with the top chopped off that
Catch me in the spots where the shots pop off at
I ain't trying to prove nothing, I'm just trying to move something


See we cooking up a thousand grams
I'm in the kitchen over the stove with pots and pans
Triple color with the platinum jams
50 birds, homeboy, in the back of a van
A hundred grand in rubberbands
We got them birds in the coffee cans
We got the whips with the extra clips
Got bitches outta state
Niggas flippin' them bricks
Been in the Caddy, been in the alley
Nigga been on the block
Right in front of Miss Gladys
Nigga know bout hustlin'
Know bout stuntin'
Did the curb-serving, shined every summer
Been on front, been in the back
Nigga roll with duct tape and ride with the Mac
See these haters like, "fuck them niggas"
We made men millionaires, hustlin' our nature


8 AM, open my eyes
Yeah, kick my bitch, tell her open the blinds
And I'm over the stove at 9
Yeah I'm cookin breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine
Yeah quick line in the bathroom before we bounce
Not me, I mean her, she go a-day-an ounce
Y'all pray for her
While I'm at the bus station in the Bentley sitting low as I wait for her
I'm gettin' dough, I'm a paper-boy, I will take you
For the right paper--boy I will take her
Shake her, tape her, waist up
Send her to the money, she be back before I wake up
Getchya cake up
Y'all niggas lame ducks
You probably get your game up when I'm giving the game up
My name Wayne, what
Hot boy flame up
You niggas trying to change up and I'm getting my change up



Before I sleep I pray to the lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake I pray to the lord my soul to take
For goodness sake

I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son be
I'm trying to live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder will I lose control of the Maserati?
And hit some tree, just being young me
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, cause I'd take over
I feel it approaching but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace


And every time I see the sunshine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
I'm feeling like I'm living on the front line
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunch time?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
I made my bed right, so when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest


Bury me a gangsta cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breath of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life, I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that on her
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so happens to make his way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock, believe that




Moolah babe
She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame
She would do anything she could to feel the flame
When everybody know your move and the things you pay
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise

He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain
When everybody know your moves, they speak of your name
And ohh, all over the late night local news I heard him scream

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise


Sometimes we try to find the road to the riches
Need roadside assistance
Blisters on my knees, from beggin' for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but knowledge on my feet
Cause I been climbin' to the peak, and runnin' from the bullshit
I'm tired of playin' the same song, who told the DJ bring it back?
Dead Presidents, bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Starin' at big poster I swear that he be winkin' back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin' back
Call me crazy, I've been called worse
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?
Ha ha, I'm probably better in my afterlife
I should cherish life but this just ain't paradise

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
... this ain't paradise; no, this ain't paradise
This ain't paradiseeeeeeeee



Young mullah, baby
Umm, young mullah, baby

Cause I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh...

Cause she say "Wayne Wayne"
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river, I can hear my conscious
While I say aloud

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver, hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And so she's gone to party town, on her own
And you go by yourself, so all alone
I told her I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much, that's the problem
Oh my god then, shorty be wildin'
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe all of the things
That she'll do and all of the things
That she'll say to make me stay
And I be like, daaaaaammmmnnnnnn

I been that boy for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way and then I send her on her way
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
Your like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself
And so she's gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone



What's up baby?
I ain't trying to do nothing but get my grown man on
I ain't trying to hurt you
Only if you want me to
Yeah, something like that

Yeah, what's happenin' baby I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out the navy, now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine, vanish from the scene
Goddamn it I'm so mannish
Handle it like a standard
So put yo panties and yo pants my the trash can
Romance on the floor plans, yeah
We hold hands while we rolling, just trying to keep up with the program
Just trying to sneak up on ya, like how you doing ma'am
I'm a old soul, and a young man, we got to it and
We didn't stop 'til the birds hit the block
And she ain't never had it like that

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

Now I don't really hit the club but tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge
Feelin' the way you walk when you move yo booty applaud
I gotta keep my composure
I gotta attack my mission and handle business like a soldier
Young man, Young Money but the money long
Curren$y, The Hot Spitta so grown
And your perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry about what you heard about me and them other birds
Might have done a little dirt and left a few of them hurt
But whatever has occurred they all got what they deserved
And you don't rock like that, I can see it in your eyes
If you ain't good for me then you wearing a disguise
Cause tonight you looking like Miss Right
And I swore to be a player for life, but I'll change for you

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

Baby girl, living in a ladies' world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now
Fly boy baby sit back, relax and
Cruise with a nigga, destination satisfaction
Whose is it baby? She say, "Weezy Fuckin' Baby"
I say, "Yes in-fuckin'-deed," she say, "Don't you ever leave"
I say, I say, "But I got money on my mind"
For a large amount of time, long and won't stop 'til daytime come home

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

Damn, look, that
Oh, that right there?
That's the sunset girl
Get your visor, where those Chanel shades I get you, you always losing things
And I'm always buying new things, I come a long way huh, remember?
Remember that block, look at you, you think you all grown

You ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now

Uptown New Orleans like always
Cash money boys shine like bald heads
Big bezzel make my watch look like a hog head
But all I do is smoke trees call me log head

And I am all about me like do re
I'm in the hood, in the hood like dope yay
Nappy ass hair like buckwheat otay
Hollygrove, Eagle street be my damn hood
Or you can get murdered for free like canned goods
I got 12 Barbaros under that Lam hood

Thirty minutes later Opa-lacka is where I be

This is a public service announcement
Little Wayne, Weezy F. Baby, is the best rapper alive

C'mon, I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid

Give a woman none
Uh-uh

It's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do bird
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
As the world in the barrel of the pistol turn
And we get it how we live, never lived and learned
Gotta talk about the flow 'cause you is concerned
Only down-south rapper could've been in The Firm
Or The Commission or a Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang, nigga
Got that Sub-Zero flow, how you owe me mine
Nigga "Get over here" like Scorpion
And when it comes down to this recording
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I won rings with my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
Same Triangle Offense
I come through the lane like a Dodge, and
Referee niggas is lame, they call charging
I have no brain, I'm retarded
We are not the same, I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late September, whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand, I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up" like Martin

Hahaha, woo! Yeah
See, I know y'all talking about me
And you don't like what you hear sometimes
But umm, since I'm so bright
I'mma put the spotlight on you baby

Show me what you 'bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin'
I know what you not, whoadie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up, now blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze
Work it

Tell the world "Take six"
Young Dictionary, make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dollars
Make the skinny girl holla
Make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me
Put the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny
Make the fly girls corny
And only for me
Because of who I A-M
Holla back in the morning
Now holla back if you own shit
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit, I don't condone it
Aw baby, just hop on it

Haha, yeah
You like that...

Marley, what up
Hey, hey, hey

You rappers ain't safe, safe, safe, safe



Yeah
Yeah
Yes!
I'mma call this one Real Rap
Because this rap is real
You know?
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You ain't never too live to die, heh

Listen
I grew up where the people call them people on us
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us
Grinding all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shittin on us
Government still quittin on us
Lost a few homies and the grief's still sittin on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin on us
Older bitches still hittin on us
I remember well
Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here
Where's Beezy at?
Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga
I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin, my nigga
But now they all rappin, my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain
Sailboat flappin, my nigga
No fingers, I'm snappin
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't
The Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy
And so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga
So I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep going
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow
So if I cry don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that
He's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his momma's fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yeah, and fuck a man with a badge
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead
Man, you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on
And the complaint goes on...
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fucking crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, hah
I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stay still motherfucker
I'mma have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me
I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late father
Or my late grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my momma
How it suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't never wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully
But, truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weez-y F. Baby
Amen

Rest in peace to my cousin Kim Carbo
My nigga Vick, Rest in peace lil Harold
Shoutout to my nigga Steveland, rest in peace pimp
Quiet Storm in the building

Pure beast, fear-free, dear grief
Zoom gone, see ya! Peace... drop one finger
Fuck 'em and whoever made 'em!
I will hurt whoever love 'em, cause I hate 'em
Lookin' for a lady, high and sedated
Got her to the pad, I don't know how a nigga made it
She gave me relations, so now, we related
The morning comes; the picture, faded
Awaited on my turn to burn, can I get a light?
Little dog, bigger bite
Jackson Five, Little Mike

The Source owe me
Shout out to the editing staff
I'm all grown, so much better with math

I'm servin' this track like, Steffi Graf, yeah
Roger Federer; there's no competitors
Niggas know my rhetoric; bitches know my preference
Sittin' in my big house surrounded by my weaponries
I keep them away like I got leprosy
Chopper right next to me, loaded up with pepper seeds
Got an extra clip, but that's only for my especiallies
Just respect a nigga game, What kinda referee is you?
Swallow your whistle, make a nigga ride with the pistol
Cause the fakest niggas ride with the pistols
Even if I die old, I'mma die with the pistols
And if you stand over my body, I'll probably kill ya
Yeah, now I feel it, Weezy the realest
I wear a lot of Bathing Ape cuz I be wit gorillas
Product of determination
Stop playin you are not up in my situation
I get money like a Caucasian
The car red, so the car cajun
It's Weezy-not-the-father motherfuckin'-Baby




I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me as long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever

Well if you don't then I'll explain
You can be my Mrs. Wayne
We can do the damn thing
You see I had to tell my nigga Lil' Boo I met a girl like you
Cause I ain't never met another girl like you
But I know what to do wit a girl like you


Well if you don't then I'll explain
I'll give up the game
At the top of the arena there's my jersey wit my name
What's happening baby, what's happening baby
You know you need to roll wit a champion baby
Any time I see ya I get asthma baby
Like th th that's my baby


Like fo real though baby girl you ain't gotta keep no secrets it's just me and you
You gotta keep it real
Your pussy like a drug to me
You got me fiending
If I could sing, if I could sing
Damn baby if only I could sing
Help me out lil' bra

I love it baby
I love it baby


See they can say what they want girl
But they'd never change my views
Cause they will never know you the way that I know you
You see I'm tryna spend the rest of my whole life with you girl
And if we gotta be alone so be it baby
And if ya friends can't understand you, you don't need them baby




Alright, alright, alright
Say roll out baby
Young money



Yeah, is the tune on? oh, it's on
Basically
I got Streets in the booth with me
Dedication trois

Now let me talk my shit
Fresh up out the water like I caught fly fish
Weezy F. bitch, I can say what I please
Swagger so cold it stay when I leave
I see you little doggs just shaking out fleas
I kill dogs like I'm making Chinese, food
Rude only when I gotta be
Sometimes I gotta tell myself not to bother me
"Tell Lil Wayne not to bother Weez!"
Shawty won't be on my team, she could cheerlead
Shit, like "Go, Wayne, go!"
Ice on a white tee, I make a snow angel
Y'all niggas squares, but ain't got no angle
My shit's so tight you can get strangled
It's Young Money, ain't no such thing as plain clothes
Polo jammers, Louis slippers
Call them "private plane clothes"
I'm taking off, going to another land
Call her misses, never going to another man
Shabba Ranks Weezy, muthafucker, I'm a lover man
Yeah talk that shit Tune
I gotta wipe my diamond grill with a tissue
I'm talking too much shit
I eat pussy and you suck dick

They call me "Lil Nut" but my nuts aren't
The same. No homo, that's how I came in the
The game, I married Mary Jane, I seen the
Spidermane, the shit that made Pinky blow
Out the Brain brain. Told Lois Lane
I can't be a Super Mane, my whole
Suit black like bat mane and I keep that iron, mane
Any woman yellow flag me, throw me out
The game, I'm back at the halftime
Like it's just an ankle sprain
Ain't no one could do it better
More hits than Eddie Guerrerra
The flow like ? at the competitors
It's mass hysteria. Historic in
Your area, 51 alien, what planet is he from
Huh? Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the shotgun
Picture Bugz with the shotgun up to Elmer Fudd
All my thugs get dirty like we running
Plug off the chain, utterly untame
Put the gun to your frame, bitch a bloodstain
Hard to come out, like a love-stain
I came from nothing, fucking calling hoes
And flying planes; who the fuck could complain?

So you mad cause I'm styling on you?
Lights off, mask on, creepy siding on you
Get violent on you, you a sissy like Cisco
It's no coincidence, man, I bet your bitch know
How I knock her down with the Kosher dill pickle
How I yell a nigga but my heart dark like nut skin
Bitches aiming for the pockets? You get nothing
Let me get back in it, bitch
I just go ahead first, you be on that timid shit
Get head first, then I be on my Jimmy shit
Shitting on bitches with that Chris Brown
"Don't give me shit!" Niggas in the streets say
"Kill them all!" Bitch, you know we got guns
Like the Pentagon. I'm just eating nigga
I'm getting my dinner on

Talk reckless, I don't give a muthafuck
I make you do what you is, bitch nigga, duck
Come for you and your kids like nigga what
Niggas with elephantitis ain't got bigger nuts
I'mma smash a nigga if he try to diss us
Cause if we did time, your main bitch would miss us

I get up in a bitch throat like hiccups
I Chris Kringle bullets with niggas like Christmas
Then turn to their female dog like "bitch, what?"
My niggas squeeze triggers like they got arthiritis
I spit nasty on the mic like I got gingivitis
The doc said I got a case of "real" nigganitis
He ain't got a vaccine or cure strong enough to fight it

Play with fire, you get burned
When the heat was on, I turned
Turned to trouble... trouble

Yeah, yeah, C3, yeah
New Orleans baby
A street called Eagle
And everybody's ill
Yeah, ill-egal
People steal cars
We steal people
We eat like dogs
But we still people
And even when ya lost
Trouble still see you
And even if ya dead broke
We are still equal
One time for the lil people
Eat ya meal, don't let ya meal eat you
StreetRunner we crazy with this one
I, run, with, trouble

And just the other day my nigga Chris killed his self
I pray to God that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when there's no help?
He figured heaven, so he went left
Y'all know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds coming, bells ringing
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama loved a drug dealer, straight quit her job
They took his life
And along with him I died
And she died
We died
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me "Daddy, don't cry, I'm alive"
I look her in the eyes
And see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

Chosen second over cheap wine)
Ya know
Just kick it back
I can't call it
Ya know? Heheh
Yeah, yeah

The tooly poke out the jeans
The coke smell just like a bunch of coffee beans
Ya na mean?
And everything ain't what it seem
Ya na mean?
And don't play that game without your team
Kill for my bread, kill for my cheese, kill for my cream
I will have that red beam on high beam
Now I hear sirens
Wait I think I see one behind me
I ain't trippin baby, money got me
And fuck the police, fuck the feds too
I ain't jumpin in that jumpsuit
A one-two, I'm on my one-two
Check me out
I fuck around and check you
Respect due
Pay yours nigga
Mine's under the seat
By my feet
Where yours nigga?
Too much hoarse liquor huh
Too much pressure, too much force
Too much money
You never heard that before
Shit
And we stop the snitches at the door
Cut that tail off the rat
He won't rat no more
That's right
Get trapped fuckin with my cheese
Keep shooting 'til I burn my sleeves
Nigga, please
These boys is Gs
Represent New Orleans like a fleur-de-lis
Shit

We more than thieves
Steal from the rich
So the poor can eat
Niggas act up
My niggas act accordingly
Hey soldier, don't war with me
You don’t want it



I'm holdin' on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path; right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her, like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain, trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat, travelin' through the fast lane

Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence wrapped around the front yard
See, Daddy was a doctor and Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now Mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
She says, "Daddy, what's wrong?", but he's just too high
"Mommy, what we gon' do?", she just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

I'm holding on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

That bullet travel hit a gut
Then hit your fitted up
Hit your whole city up
Hit you while you laying down
Shots leave you sittin up
Run in the bathroom on your girl and get a titty fuck
Right after I bust a nut I bust the gun get rid of her
Y'a bunch of pussy’s having a pity party
My guns look like they in kindergarten
I’m the dirtiest seed in any garden
Got more stripes on my sleeve than any sergeant
The paralyzed feel me, the blind see me
And the deaf can hear me

Hi-highway to heaven, I would drive you home


Eagle street where them twenty’s go for 25

Feet back stay from where the fake be at
Niggas snitch for the shine where the patience at
Nigga make his own brother face his back
Give love and take it back
Good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats
Face the facts you can't change him can't shoot it if you can't aim it
Can't miss him if he kill you then you can't blame him
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him
Get too deep up in that water and they can't save ya
Me I come out of that water like I was just bathing
And watch my step on a wet pavement
Yea I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take em
Hollygrove Hollygrove was his last statement
So nigga get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me W-E-E crooked letter Y I'm so high

Street sweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in ya speakers from the chopper blast

It all stop when they hit you in ya top and back
No cocking back silly motherfucker you ain't heard bout this

That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call tommy
Guaranteed to get you bitches from by me
When I hit every piece of ya visible body he leaking
Mortimer is no longer leaping he sleeping
While you pussy niggas is sleeping I'm thinking
Deep in thought the boy ain't even winking
Bob Marley got me stinking
Stacking figures I'm standing firm life's a slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins from where I came
Though I bear a name only one can live with
Coach they won't knock me off my pivot forget it
I'm sicker with it
Pick a city buy a condo find a fine ho let some time go chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo about dough
Nothing! Man the four wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tanktop pocket fan
No pocket knife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat BOOM!
Ha ha tonight I might just boost my feature price
Cause to each its own and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house big momma's house
She told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out
And he ain't getting up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot
Hold up the beat might drop

I'm richer than a bitch without the grey poupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head

But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

I'm so unsigned, it would blow ones mind
Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Never L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Ya heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger like, "I can't deal with this shit"
They say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly
Like Pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf
And throw his trash ass through the window like Mookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard, you're coochie, Wally Oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Said I'm movin' slow, I'm just thinkin' fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, I'm 'bout to lap your ass
And nigga I don't rest, I'm up 'til my time's up
I been a tec chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't punch lines, nigga your punch is lyin'
Cause the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne



All I have in this world...

They know where Carter at, straight off the launchin' pad
Marchin' on the moon muthafucka, I been to Mars and back
Cleaner than laundry mats, jumpin' in somethin' from
Other countries, companies, junkie, you cannot order that!
I flew that into the water back
Order, go to Iraq and get a car with gas and tell them crackas war with that
I'm a goon, I go zoom; smell the fumes from the vrooms
Young Tune in the room, gimme room, or you doomed
I am soon to get all my chips and doubloons
I would never be another groom unless I assume
The bitch ain't givin' up the womb to him and whom
M.O.B., let me bloom, let me boom
I pop early like firecrackers in the last week of June
I'm gettin' my lunch like noon, I gotta eat
Scarface with diamond teeth

On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
Nobody knew my name, they only knew my face

Lord, protect me from my friends, I can take care of my enemies
I come from where the niggas just kill to save energy
Sorry, world, but my mommy drop me where the clinic be
So if you tried to mimic me you'd probly catch some sick disease
Six degrees, leanin' on that promethathathathazene
I'm a centipede, these men move at women speed
I'm bout my spinach, cheese, dough, chedder, feddi, gwop
Money, moolah, mozzarella, et cetera, et cetera
Fuck competitors, fuck these rappers, fuck these editors
Fuck the head of the state, fuck the gates surroundin' the prisoners
These muthafuckas the prey; I'm the Predator, see me dreadlock
Tough as Bamm-Bamm from Bedrock; I'm tied to the game like wedlock
Say "hello, red dot", say "goodbye, life" and say "hello, Satan"
A devil in the flesh, a rebel at its best, no complainin'
We live in Hell and I'm blessed, Scarface




I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world
I put my whole city on, to some things that they never would've known
If I didn't
And every night is a premiere, if I ever disappear
Best believe I'm comin' back
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again, on that same shit again
All I ever do is

I tell her, I'm gettin' motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, who is he
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idols
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
And hopefully live to see, what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shutter at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just tryin' to swerve without hittin' the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them, out
Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall, sittin' this tall
I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all

I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world
I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear
Best believe I'm comin' back
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is

If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel

Rapping is my hobby, my house has a lobby
My bitches act snobby, because I feed them thousands
I know that didn't rhyme but I'm only being honest
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas
I swear I got on Saks 5th boxers right now
I'm trynna milk the game as if the game was a cow
I had an Eddie Bauer Expedition seven years ago
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I been here before
I used to wear braids like Jason's Lyric, whoa
Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high
High as the voice of Akon
And make mine a straight with no chase
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate
I got 'em running after me like I'm about to win a race

Cause I'm a beast, I'm a dog
Bitch I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog

The door close to the booth, I feel like a caged lion

Cause I ain't going back and fourth like badminton
No I will never drop the ball like bad mitten
And I ain't being conceited, I'm just admitting

Take a shit in yo' yard, take a piss on yo' broad
Make a list of yo' boys, and go and murder them all, huh
Life is short, yeah a midget told me that
And I always thought I was fly like I had a pigeon on my back
But I got decisions on my back, vision on my back
So don't you try to run up on me, I got precision with that gat

Bet I hit my tar-get, like a fucking dart mat
My address is Cloud 9, seek and you shall find

Shots through the window of your brand new Ashton
You get out try to run now your chest where them bullets crashin'
Pawn box niggas no crutches no casts
No wheel chair just the two door long black wagon
Flowers on the side and four wheels to steer
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care

But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard
I'm alright, God, shit, I'm still breathin
But losses hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it

Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga

Lord, will I be next for the taking? Take me

But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin
And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin

We still beatin, we gon rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin and we losin'
We survive if nothin
They could never take the stride from strugglin

But I just think about my buddy

Escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin like it was just yesterday
Let's pray
Ten fingers together

It's murda-murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather

Gotta know the Tec
Live under my seat
Put you in the ground
Now you live under my feet
All white diamonds
On the front of my teeth
And you better put the 'O'
In front of my 'G'
The bullshit they talking
Doesn't come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker
Don't run it by me
My two best friends
Will accompany me
And right now
They are in my dungarees, sleep
One named Mack
One named Nina
They hit you
Make you do the Macarena
Where your tool?
You gon' need it like a mufucker
And I am so

And we eating, get your own supper
Make me go off in the trunk
Get that Bone Crusher

Chest, head, face
Arm, leg, stomach

'Cause I got my thang, my thang, my thang

They call me Hot Sauce
They know I keep that toaster
You can be my Pop Tart
I never had height
But boy I got heart
And I ain't gotta speak

Than any movie you've saw
I pull up on you
Like I need some Grey Poupon
Hard hat? No
But I got the tool on
And you should be my paper
If ever the tool's drawn
Yeah
Flow retarded
When I spit I get my drool on
I don't rap
I just shit like a newborn
I don't write
I just spit like a tooth gone
So tell them haters
Cut it out like a coupon
How come that chopper
Sound like a nuke bomb
Little nigga
Gotta hold that bitch with two arms
I got that heat, the fire, and the lukewarm
I'm on your heels like a shoe horn

Tec's, AK's
I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face
Arm, leg, stomach
I never been afraid
I ain't scared of nothing
Cuz I got my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch go
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
You hear them guns, like
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom



I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time

And when they see me, they C-3 baby

She marks her calendar, reschedule every plan
She knows when I'm coming, she's more than a fan
She got my tour dates, she also got a man
But even homie gotta understand
And no one gon take it from her, nothing's gon' make her miss it
And when I go she'll miss it
Next day another city, she's never coming with me
I'm nothing more than memories
Memories she keep forever
She always dream about me, wish she could sleep forever
She get her fit together, she get her shit together
After my concert, she wanna get together
I get her on my bus, we chill and sit together
She has no curfew, I can take the bitch wherever
Come off a bit respectful, I'm on a different level
I got her feelin special, then she remember

But I can make you love me forever
Baby I can make you love me forever

Now all the hoes hate her, the dudes wanna date her
Her nigga saw her leave, she deal with him later
Right now she with the greateast, I'm even homie's favorite
How could he even blame her, she doin him a favor
She let that nigga love her, she let that nigga save her
But when I come she let a nigga take her
She turnin off her phone, she turnin off her pager
Tell hime that shit on roam, that nigga goin in labor
These niggas hate the game, but they can't block the layup
And she go home to him, he sicker than a patient
He waitin at the table, no breakfast at the table

But I can make you love me forever
I can make you love me forever, yeah

Them older bitches jealous, say she's a groupie whore
But every woman in this world was you before
See everybody wish to porn that superstar
But when it come true, how true you are
See, I can't be her man, and she can't be my girl
Oh, but we fuck like it's the end of the world
I got a wife, she knows, my wife ain't on the road
When she come to my room, she take off all her clothes
Say anything goes, tomorrow same clothes
We probably order movies, we probably lay together
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her

I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time

Yeah

Motherfuck 'em

Ladies and gentlemen, the great Manuella

I got this rat named Shelly that love Makavelli
Number 5 combo meals and splashin KY jelly
I have old school shorty, still drink a forty
Grab the mic, start a fight, and fuck up the whole party
Baby you should leave, adjust yo weave
That's velcro, hell no, bitch go wit Steve
I got this lead singer bitch from a popular group
I would say her name, but she bought me a coupe
Got this super ho Shawna, smell like marijuana
How she dig Lil Wayne, but she love the Big Tymers
Got pretty girl Patrice found out I'm fuckin her niece
She tried to stab me, so I grabbed her and we called the police
Mister Officer, the bitch done lost it bruh
She goin to jail, oh well, I be fuckin her
See two dyke Spanish twins nuts pressed on they chin
Will we go video, well nigga, that depends


I got old school bitches and new school hoes
Female basketball players with cornrolls
And I don't like short-haired girls, no not really
If I do, she gotta look like the old Halle Berry
Or the broke Toni Braxton, the first Lil Kim
But I still take hood rats and work with them
Put yo ass in a jag and I drop ya quick
Give ya ass a lil game, if ya smirk ya in
I'm a pimp, not a simp, like ice in my drink
And I don't think twice or blink cause I'm focused
Rollin in the whitest mink like I'm polar
Bear, yea, let down my hair
Get jazzy on a bitch like Fred Astaire
Rose gold in her face get her red as glare
My Bentley plum, my Mercedes pear
I am lookin for a freak, mama take me there, yea




Like I dropped straight from heaven
And this ain't how I was born
But this is how I live
So that's how I'll die, and do not close my eyes
So when you see me in the casket I'm a look right back at ya
Cause I don't trust none of y'all
Fuck every one of y'all
Now which one of y'all wanna brawl?
And overall I got that pistol under all of my garments
Torment, torture
Tragedy, catastrophe
No battery, just murder in the coldest temperature
And that means first degree
Even if motherfucker never heard of me
I ain't gonna let you motherfuckers worry me
And tell that beef I'm Burger King
I represent that saint's sign
I'm so high I can paint signs
And if she ain't fine, she ain't mine
Thank god that I'm alive
But if he end it all today, I have done more that I can say

Forever, forever

The Lord is my shepherd
You haters can't harm me
I walk with his blessings
The angels be my army
Of course there's a weapon on my waist within arm's reach
Though I walk through the valley in the shadows of death
Forgive me Lord I had to carry my tech
I touch cash and get cheese
Play with that cash I bust mags, indeed
Forgive those who trespassed against me
For they know not what they do until they history
Gone, memories
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
Like what happens when I get up with my enemies
Paybacks, penalties
Bang back, send em' these
They got to pour it on the floor for ya
Maybe next time they'll pray a little more for ya


I pray to God not Lucifer
Devil I'm rebuking ya
Lord have mercy on my soul when I'm suited up
Daddy was a hustla, mommy was a Christian
Momma said prayers, daddy steady cookin' chicken
If I'm living life wrong, I don't wanna be right
Send me blessings to the cloud, hope I make it through the night
Dear Lord as you lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
Then I pray to the Lord my soul to take
There shall be no other god before thee
Lord please forgive me of my sins if I O.D, slowly
I know I should not kill but I will
If a nigga try to shoot me and lay me still
I'm so sorry for the wrong thing's that I've done
This the end of my prayer we all say amen


Dear God
As I begin this day, my thoughts turn to you
And I ask for your help and guidance in everything I say and do
Give me the patience that I need to keep my peace of mind
And with life's cares, I hope dear God, some happiness to find
Let me live but for today, not worrying what's ahead, for I have trust that you
Will see I get my daily bread
Give me the courage to face life's trials and not from troubles run
And let me keep this thought in mind "Thy will, not mine, be done."
And if some wish I do not get though I have prayed to thee
Please help me to believe and understand you know what's best for me
I've failed you many time, I know
But tonight when I rest
I hope that I can say, "Dear God, I've tried my best....rapper alive."

So we ride like 4 Pirelli's
So secured no security, no protectin no comparing
Locin' and heavy, Ocean 11
Aviators, both tickers, so figures
No playas, I'm Holly Grove to the heart
Hollygrove from the start
Don't cross Earhardt
Boulevard where the ward I come from
Brrrt Brrrt! Pop Pop! Clap Clap!

We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now its time to floss

Get 'em get 'em Weezy hit 'em where you kill 'em easy
Sit 'em in the river, leave em, they find 'em tomorrow evening
Sinkin I'm probly drinkin that syrup
Thinkin I won't slip, even though I'm leanin like a broke hip
He don't know I got the nina wit the full clip
That's a somersault back spin full flip for ya?
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin I'm just bustin until this scene clean
12 hundred for the jeans stop playin
Hundred dollars for the Glock in my pants
Who the man? I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock the brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect
I- strap a jet black gat 'til the death
Tell the mama to bury me with that, No Bullshittin'
My hood getting kinda crazy where I be
So Ronie's with me cuz he's the OG

We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now its time to floss

Fresh out the back seat of the figgity phantom
The haters I make 'em madder when I wave at 'em like what up?!
If it ain't about money I keep goin
I tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn
But Fuck, them boys I got the shottie on my arm
If them boys run up I leave their bodies on the lawn
And Duck the fuck out a there, cuz baby its hot out there
If this was a movie it's time to roll the credits, cut!
Its all over, all of ya brains is all over the motherfuckin' block!
I'm a motherfuckin' rock!
Hard body eagle street 17 shots
Night vision double-clip, hot steady beam, Glock. Pop!
Drop little man drop
This is not for little bitches you man or a fox
I'm layin in the drop, thinking of more money
Cash money, young money
Take money, your money

We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now its time to floss

Now shorty lets get down to business
If you want it, you can get it
I know its been a minute, and you ain't got time for gimmicks
But when you roll like me, on your own like me
You gonn' wake up all alone and you will see, see, see
I'm at an all time low, we don't talk no more
Cause I want you back, I need you girl, that's all I know

Now talk to me, talk to me, talk
Walk with me, walk with me, walk
I know these things that we said
How can we stop and leave all

How can we ruin something so perfect, so fluent
We was young, We was dumb, We ain't know what we was doing
But now that we older, older
Lets take these things slower, slower
Reset the button, button
And start it all over, over
I cannot stop what I feel, You ain't a notch in my belt
I ain't gonna lie to you girl, I want you all to myself
And forgive for being stingy though
Take you all the places that you swear you never been before
Why is this so difficult, This should be the easy part
Believe me if you need me, Ain't no way we finna keep apart

No matter where I go, No matter who I'm with
I always think of you, Cause baby you the shhh
I love your body girl, There's no denying that
I will not rest, I will not sleep, like an insomniac
I keep you up all night, You know I get it right
I give it to you fast or slow, Or anyway you like
So give it one more chance
Now how you want it
If we pick up where we parted
We can finish what we started girl



Cut the music up please

Yeah, I shall never leave Hip-Hop
Controlled by my two hands, they go tick tock
Around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone
I’m feelin' like I’m on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on
And I don’t go to church because the lyin' long
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I know my Lord — I am God’s own
Back to my hands, tick-tick; a time bomb

I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

Tryna stay afloat on my inner tube
When they turned my city into a swimmin' pool
Before that, it was a livin' cesspool
We gotta get on our shit, like gnats do
Polices be on my tip, like hats do
But I stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do
And in this game, nobody’s on my plateau
Therefore my name remains, like a tattoo
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots
B-I-R-D-man Junior, or — Weezy F. Baby, baby

I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

That ain't me
See I won’t stop, that ain't me
I won't quit, that ain't me
No, I won't stop, that ain't me
Cause that ain't me

Alright; alright, alright, alright
I’m in their conversations
The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo

I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

The Dedication 3

Yeah Money Making Weezy; Weezy makin' money
I keep my dick in my pants but them hoes take it from me
I go to sleep on Monday and I wake up Sunday
I go to sleep with money and wake up with money
Man I'm on about 5 of 'em
My girl so thick you can see her ass from the side of her
Yo girl just came in her booth somebody better get her a flammable suit
I got that bitch jumpin like a kangaroo
Ain't a thing to do but to bang or screw
I live in the clouds like the angels do
Hey traffic let my Vanquish through
Hey ma, this what I think of you
I wanna fuck yo head off and fuck yo ankles loose
Then drank the juice
I'm dangerous
I got her clothes falling off like the hanger loose
I be the monster in her closet
She wanna go to mars I tell her hop on top my rocket
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, take off
John Travolta with the head; I suck yo face off
Tell yo man take that cape off
I put his ass in the pocket like the 8 ball
Wait yall I've never been tall
But if I stand on my money I'll be with god
Like hallelujah baby it's it's Young Mulah baby

Young Gudda put the gun to yo head make ya pop like a bubble
When I pop off you in trouble
Gat to yo waist click clack niggas fuckin knees buckle
Look at these suckas
Talkin this bullshit they don't know gudda got a full clip
And I pull shit
Leave yo stupid ass wet like a pool bitch I don't bullshit, no
Leave a bitch nigga stinking like bullshit
Gudda ain't the nigga you should fool with, no
These niggas know me nigga
Knife like shinobi nigga

Yo motha owe me nigga
Yo brotha paid me nigga
Yo sista laid me nigga
And I made your wife suck my Weezy F. babies nigga
I'm still a crazy nigga
Fuckin right I'm wildin'
Nigga I just made a hundred fucking million dollars
Nigga I ain't even gotta rhyme
Nigga I just made a hundred fucking million dollars



Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me
One man with no weapon at war, but I'm an army
Your penny pension and they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up, and guess what, I was up
I get my cheese like Mickey Mouse, or else you better Donald Duck
Like a shootin' range target, I get all kinda bucks
Be my shootin' range target, nigga I got good luck
Nigga bye bye good luck, got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass nigga, who thought Popeye wasn't tough
I'm on that la la, twist it up, I'm on that syrup, slow it down
And I like four freaks too, and I ain't Yung Joc but its goin' down
I buy a marijuana field, then I just mow it down
Big bad wolf, yes, I just blow it down
No homo and to Hollygrove, I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives, I got the sharpest flow around

Future
I know they can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self

Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I got the heart of a king, blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave
But it's one life to live, that's why I'm gettin' paid
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise, blaze as I gaze
At the stars and ask the Lord, why the culprit's at the pulpit
It make me sick to my stomach, that's why I rap
Like a pregnant woman, I don't spit I vomit
So pay homage, me and Wayne two G's
Like twenty hundreds and we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothers from another
So fuck with him and Mack gonna react like you did me somethin'
That's a hint to you Davids, throwin' shots at Goliath
This the New Testament, where the victor is the giant
So you should get your weight and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female's trait




Michael Phelps this for you baby

I’m goin’ for the gold
My heart is in control, my mind is on succeed
And I am in the lead
Don’t buy into the schemes
The science or stratege
Just giant N-U-T’s brings triumph and relief
I’m reliant on redeem, inspired by the green
Never tieing off of fatigue, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I’m lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things I’m a die as a king
If I don’t do it now I’m a try it again
And when I do accomplish it
I’m a try it again, I’m a riot insane
I’m a lion my mane hangs down to my strings
And they’re tied to the game, I stay dry when it rain
I’m tried of the fame
Got everything to gain and I’m proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane besides we’re the same
Whose guiding the train, whose flyin’ the plane
Whose drivin’ the lane
Who dies when it bang, who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain, who cries when they sang
You hide but you can’t, you hide but you ain’t
I advise you to thank, you’ll find what you can’t
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank, the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank, combined with my strength
My time and my length, I’m a iron out the kinks, yes I’m on the brink
And in the eye of a wink, I’m a retire in the bank yeeaahhh

And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
No I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeaaahhhh I, I’m gon’ get it, I, I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeeaahhh
Cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

Sshh, victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy’s misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively
You can’t harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually
You’ll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of this is what you did to me
Nothin’s what you did for me, nothin’s what you give to me
I take whatever I’m visualing
Now break all of the limiting, now shake all of the gimicking
The fakery, the trickery, nurse how sick is he, worse I’m sickening
I’ll be at the finish line first
How quick is he, I’ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain’t with the bickering, I’m full of dignity, I’m full of energy
Pull out the inner me or bull after dinner meat
I stood in the winter heat, it could be the end of me, but good be defending me yeeeaaahhh

And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

Yeaahhh I’m allergic to cheatin’
I hate failure and I’m in love with achievement
Above and beneath it
A hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize
And I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin’ begun with the preachin’
Now pray until I am one with the deacon
Now play until I have won whatever we win
I play until I have won and then I re-win, yeeeaaahhhh

And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeah
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
And I’m no quitterrrrr

They lookin at me like they drink spoiled milk
Like they sittin' on a hill
Ice on the neck of me, ice on the wrist of me
Ice in both hands bitch I'm lit like a Christmas tree
Different color stones you could call it a mystery
Big dookie rope, you would think they was lynchin' me
Chain on top of chain man I look like Mr. T
I pity the fool the day he try to get with me
Fresh Prince, got banks like Hilary
And I hit docks with the hickory dickory
I make the girls run fast like Benny Hill
Rims go round and round you can call them my Ferris wheels
Pockets full of bank rolls, money long as train smoke
And it come faster than a nigga fuckin' J-Lo
I don't play games I shoot it up like Halo
Got more paper than your job's got payroll
Still I'm ghetto like no frills
I clean the dirt out my nails 100 dollar bills

Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing

As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it?
Cause you look like you never been
You're more of a Hell's Angel
And for you, I'd rather sin
Broken heart, love you with a broken heart
For you I'd jump off Noah's arc
Love is blind and hope is dark
Why does pain feel so good?
Love is science live for you
Die for you, and I'll die smiling

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you, you know I'd do anything for ya
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby, but you won't do the same
No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is


If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

What the fuck do I be thinkin?
Kill, kill, murder and Benjamin Franklin
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas
And me being a gangsta, I get into your girlfriend

And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman
You heard me, you heard him
Him being me
And we are better than
All you y'all bitches, niggas, hoes
Enemies, foes
Threes, twos, ones
But these dudes won



I remember then, back in December, it was winter like '89
Shit I must have been 7 goin' on 8
And comin' from da kitchen was an echo from all the bass
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there I would stare
But I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
So I stop bein' lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat

And I hope that she is having da ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow... no

Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
With no seeds
So she can't eat

My heroes had the broads and the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin', thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb

It made so much sense for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb

And that shit I hated
Like early 90's late 80's
I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street, about me
I'm a G

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little I tote my gun
Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around wit none
Shit, nigga you would be crazy
Cause niggas is crazy
And I'm a 80's baby
You should be proud of me
Cause in them streets
I'm hot like da 80's
And my temperature's raisin'
I'm at 100 I'm blazin'
Somebody shower me
Please, pretty please

You can call me wizzle, or you can call me Wayne, man either one
But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
But she just say, "Baby", she just calls me "Baby"
She just screams out "Baby!" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me
M.-O.-E



Rasta dem king of the jungle
Dreadlocks swing down me back like Rapunzel
My bred'rin sling dem pack in a bundle
We'll take yo ting sell it back to yo uncle
And we'll make it rain 'till ya dances to come true
We'll make it rain til ya better bring a swim suit

Now if you want to mash we can crash like a cymbal
Look upon me window I'm a new sports coupe
12 horses in the hood sittin on horseshoes
Come from the land dat Jesus walk through
Sacrifice me life man I bleed for me own crew
Dem no wanna rum rum wit me dem no want to
Murder dem and the family dem belong to
Gangsta dem know it run the street like the car do
You can hafta leave me or dearly depart you
Hip hop is mine now, mine what ya gon do?
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
Play time for me cause see to me they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon
How come every bar stand strong like a bar stool
How come every line so raw you gone snort to
Murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem
Man I murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem



Man, I ain't got nothing but some pussy and some paper
I keep a bad bitch like a muthafucking Laker
I don’t love them hoes, fuck that pussy till its aching
Pass a bitch like Troy Aikman
Man, gangstas don’t die, gangstas go to Vegas
We don’t need no navigation, we go where the money takes us
Muthafucking fools, like the first of fucking April
I ain't never been a pussy, have you ever been in pussy?
Thats so muthafucking good, feel like a treasure in a pussy
I’m a shovel in a pussy, or devil to them pussy
Spill the champagne on them pussies
Yeah, same shit different restroom
Stop playing, I turn your chest into a flesh wound
Ha, you would never guess who's in my guest room
Now they saying "just me Tune!"

Tunechi, that what they call me man
Big dog muthafucker, you’s a Pommerain
They say fuck me, then Karma came
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name

And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name
In my momma name…guns in my momma name
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name

I’m smoked out, I’m by myself
Bitch, I’m a king no matter how the cards are dealt
It’s Young Money or it’s take money
Long hair don’t care, call me jake sully
Pay me or pay for me
I tell em hoes stay on ya toes, ballet for me
Momma pray for me
Goons spray for me
I have em bring me your head on a tray for me
Cut the brain raw, pussy ass nigga I’m at your chest like a training bra
Tune talk that shit that rip straight through the kevlar
Pull a bitch over, dump his ass in a reservoir
Real nigga repertoire
Add five or six blunts to the head, it helps
Reportin’ live from the top of the food chain
We eatin man, now what my name?
Tunchi, yep! That what they call me man

Gudda Gudda, double G, it’s all the same
The game ain't never been the same since the Carter came
And I stay high bitch, fly like the largest plane
You Captain save a ho, cuffin like a sargeant man
Duck tape on the handle of my pistol nigga
And I don’t spit no more I drew like a retarded man
Shawty on my lap, watch me pump pump up the party man
Don't you hold a grudge cause your bitch chose me, I’m sorry man
Young nigga with old school, game like an Atari man
Thats your ho callin’ man
I’m Gudda Gudda bitch, thats what they call me man



How can something so right, go so wrong

I used to love her, fuck it, I still do
Cause love never die, but it can kill you
I pray to Heaven's sky, that it never kill me
It can get you real weak, but fuck it I'm a little G
My baby girl thought I was fucking every little freak
But darling, I was raised by a woman, that ain't the real me
Still, she managed to to spill out a little me
Watched the doctors wipe the blood, from her little feet
And goddamn she resembles me
She's my forgiveness for every sin and penalty living in me
She should be living with me
But what am I to do when her mother disagree?
I do me, but...


I even took your hand, and walked down the aisle
It takes a strong man, to do that young and wild
Look at your wedding band, that's 17 thou
But still she took the stand, now I pay for my child
And there comes divorce, mama I had to file
And as sad as it sounds, mama, I'm happy now
And my other girl got a new baby daddy now
And retaliation hurts, she getting married now
And when I lay down to sleep, I feel like I have died, I can be carried out
And buried now
But hear me now, I am here and now
So appealing 'til I disappear, but still, it got me feelin' like...


I'm in my early 20s, now all the ladies dig me
They like that baby face, they like the Baby in me
That's why it's Weezy Baby, and please say the baby
You know that nigga baby, yeah, he done paid me crazy
I won a few Source awards, I haven't won an a Oscar
So I don't know how to act, like my sweet ain't sour
So I run to my mama
She let me smoke and fret about my drama, then give me power
I'm a go and use all my knowledge and get acknowledged
If the pro tools stop recording, I'm still ballin'
I know you probably don't care about where my heart is
But just to let you know, it's where yours is
But...




Look, I bought it out like stunna
I hope when we kiss we make you sick to your stomach
Stuntin' like my daddy and yo momma eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth to mouth with your woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little Funyun
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunyan
Touchin up my flows like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet cause my words like seduction
And when we on the jet you don't come up in our discussion
And if you say you ballin we probably don't trust ya
And I know plenty freaky hoes that probably won't fuck ya
Even if you payin boy they probably won't fuck ya
Only if I say that she can touch you like Busta
But she might touch ya and burn you like Usher
Me and my clique be in red like Russia
I shit these rappers out and sometimes I forget to flush ya
Grand daddy purp or Bubba kush crush ya
Explode in a bitch mouth like a Gusher
Cash Money, Young Money, check the production
I am just a Martian prepared for abduction


I walk it out like crutches
Two girls jumped me like double dutches
My nigga T-Street know a girl name Dutchess
And every time he see her in the street she be cussin'
I told him he should wave the black flag cause she buggin'
He said the pussy good he said "Ya dig?" so I dug 'em
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I give her much dick and a whole lot of nothing
I'm spittin like I stumbled on a gold pot or something
And when I was six I saw my role model hustlin
So I gotta hustle
These rappers talkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothin
You drive me out on Saturday, I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the argue 'bout, nigga Tha Carter out
This is what I call a drought.. 3
And we don't walk it out, we drop top Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we choke 'em out
They don't want it nah-uh
No they don't want it nah-uh
You see they phony I'm not
Oh yeah they phony I'm not
I Eastside walk it out, I bring New Orleans out
I am a Saints fan, oh yeah we marchin' now
Like we're a saints band, I play the organs now
And if they talkin' most likely I'm what they talkin' 'bout
My nigga T from the East roll up that forest now
Man I'm just trying to get my peanuts I'm like Charlie Brown
Ok that Uzi make the holy sound, take two of these and walk around
Come straight from the homeless town, this game belong to Carter now, bitch

Let you know something about me
I'm a Southern boy! Know what I'm talking about?

I remember all the days stuck in December
Caught in the rain, all the pain, having no money come my way
But now I'm making money even when I sleep
Eyes wide awake, but I really need a dream
We hustle, hustle

I go by Weezy, baby, so call me "Lil Weezle"
My city is New Orleans, baby, my street is Eagle
And that's my nigga's ?
He like to break a piece
He got the gun, I got the rope, my nigga pick a tree
Ain't talking money, I let the nickel speak
Niggas think I'm cheap, you ain't gon cent to me
Flip em like a shovel with that wrist work
I stop ya, heard? I keep em coming like clockwork
J cool with the jump, it's an outburst
And we gon' be from South Philly til the South dirt
Baton Rouge, Lafayette or the Outskirts
It's lilWeezyana stay in your house jerk,
This ain't a concert, this ain't a hot verse


Every hustle, we hustle, hustle - hey!

Straight from the bottom, now I'm high as a mountain
From the city where you need way more protection than a condom
Had a dream but I'm conscious, see the veins in my sockets
In the sky, wishing I could turn this plane into a rocket
And just leave here, more money but the problems still live here
I feel the pressure from my lil peers
Cause I'm about to blow, Swisher Sweet breathe in
Big fish swimming in the deep end
No present, fuck I'm into pretense
I remember rainfall in the street
I promised to myself I would be the best
You could say I'm crazy or a mess
Just hand me a wrench
And it's nothing you can tell a ho
Life is just a bitch, I'll forgive her but I'll never forget



If you hear me 'fore you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King Kong, King Kong
If you hear 'fore you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King Kong, King Kong
King Kong, King Kong
King Kong, King Kong
If you hear 'fore you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

I pop my trunk and everybody get to runnin'
The Fireman, bitch, like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryna get a dozen
My name like honey, got a lot of bitches buzzin'
The neck of the barrel
So long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch
You just luncheon
And munch
Like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eyes on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on point like an arrow
Street nigga, baby, I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life, like a man with a gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle

I got that
Yeah, I'm talkin bout that
Blum-blum, Blum-blum that Blum-blum
Yeah, choppers with drums

And I feed him banana clips
And let him sing, like Gladys Knight and the Pips
I'm just sticking to the motherfuckin' manuscript
Understand, I'm tryna get the chips, and the dip
Better know I hold that gun with a Panther grip
My hollow bullets got tips, like a dancer bitch
Where my money? Where my money?
Need to answer quick
Gotta get back up on my ransom shit
So you lay on top of speakers
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers
Before I do a day on the edge I will leap first
Bet you any money that I will land feet first
Married to the Benjamins
Battle all my enemies
Riding with Bigfoot
Harry and the Hendersons
Godzilla, King Kong
And if I have to park
I will open up my trunk
And it will be Jurassic Park

I got that
I'm talking 'bout that
Blum-blum, blum-blum
That blum-blum
That blum-blum
I'm talking 'bout that
I'm talking 'bout choppers with drums
Choppers with drums
Choppers with drums

I got a serious mental plan
Dental plan
You don't want to bring the giant out of the gentle-man
Gee, golly, gigabytes, and a gorilla's hand
To the side of a nigga face like I don't give a damn
Even if he's with his mans
And thems
I put his plans
And limbs
All over his pants
And Timbs
I wasn't fortunate to grow up like The Sims
But instead I blew up
Before I grew up
I spend 8 and put 2 up
Cause you never know when I have to do what
Do when?
Do who?

And watch me get at her
The badder part about it is, these niggas hate
But you won't even get a bar on my mixtape
I'm probly on a boat feedin a bitch grapes
And crepes
By the way, that's French pancakes
Je parlons Francais tres bien
Garcon adore chaude lesbiennes
Pardon my French
Pardon the stench
But I smoke that Grinch
Til my eyes squinch

Unbelievable

Bitches say they love you
But they hate you
And they say that it's all a part of our animal nature
Son, just watch your damn behavior
Cause every animal has a tamer

Go down like the rain that the drain sucks
Goddamn the game sucks
Thank God I'm famous

But smart, very smart - too smart for your knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It’s YME, nothin' gets in between us

Tell Wayne I’m goin' in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game, nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rockin' with Young Money
I told my team I got us man, it’s all on me
Like Volume two B.G., I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki

Can’t find us anymore, it’s random
When Young Money come through you better salute us


Hey I solemnly swear if it ever go down
You ain't never got to call me cause I’mma be there
Let's get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shell toes
Strapped like Velcro and this we running hell no

You can get the top, you can pop like 7-Up
Knock knock let us up, Young Money applaud me
And we’ll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

I’ma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn’t given
Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in
Just look at what I’ve been in and this is just the beginning

Blowing kisses to the soldiers, I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me
Cause Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army

Lil Wayne, here to hang, other words here to stay
Feel my pain, Fireman, I spark in the rain

Call it insane but I'm a hustler to the muscle
And them new drop Bentleys look like pussy in the summer
So I'm fucking that, hugging that, block like I'm loving that
Never sell a crumb where my mother at —run with that
You can come at me for beef and shots come with that
Your bitch come at me for wood and I'm the lumberjack!

Looking like I'm tryna bring Yay back, ASAP
Give it to 'em raw, no Ajax, taste that
Heh, fuck around and make your face crack

Where I come from so I learned how to make that
Yeah, turn that straight to a G stack
Stack up my cheese, now I'm screaming "Where the keys at?"

I'm live from, block one, five-one
Where my young niggas on the rise to get a name
Don't try them
Wayne, I feel your pain and I see your stress
How they think your people 'posed to get through Katrina off a FEMA check?
Coke in the Pyrex; dope and the ice, yes
Mind on the highway, road signs, right, left
And that's the mind-state of kids growin' up
Still they wonder why the crime rate's goin up
Fuck with my money I, torch guys, off guys
Niggas turn to tin foil when they see the iron man
Pressure bust pipes, I apply it and
Move like a lion through the jungle, yes
There is none higher than me
Don't slip up and end wind up in the lion's den
Big body Benz idlin', higher than
A chick that flight-attend or Air Force flyer man
Bad bitches I fly 'em in, fuck 'em
Send 'em back home hyped feeling like they on nitrogen
Just call me the Pied Piper man
Still get the coke through the pipeline, then off to the piper stem
And I'm still getting paper back in rubber bands
I still got paper bags coming in
I still got that mattress with the paper bags under it
Comic books, Playboy baby mag under it, still!
I still got ties with my guys who don't speak no English
Them Vatos, they got those cheapest
Got no green card, got no visas, and got those Pablo features
They drop off and pick up; I pick up then drop off
Then drop off what's picked up, and then what?
I do it



This is what they call me

Eagle, Eagle Carter man
In a '96 Regal contraband
On my way to the east to the laundromat
Got to wash that money and get on my ass
Gotta flip them bricks it be gone so fast
I got to do something I done blown my last
Dollar holler at your boy on the ave
In that Jeep pidico is what I'm known to have
Shit tend to be slow I put on the mask
And make it Halloween and take all your bags
I say Holly-holly grove won't you go and stand up
And make these motherfuckers understand
But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya'll men designing women, I'm a woman's man
I'm the Cash Money prince blow the trumpets band, and
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I'm a major set back when my album drop

I'm trying to get back door I demand it now
Yeah, panic now, you better pan it down
'Fore the neighbors they overhear me tear it down
Yeah it's Weezy F. Baby and his crown, the prince

This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

And the hand gun is so included
Don't get it confused I want no confusion
And keep ya ho I don't want your contusions
I make my hoes stop and let the dough keep moving
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
It's money over bitches that I am going to keep proving
It's Weezy F, I got ya momma groovin'
Out of all the Hot Boyz she say I'm the coolest
I bought my bag of oranges its time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm trying to seduce it
I floss, a awful lot of haters try and reduce it
But the laser on the 45 is eyeing you stupid

New Orleans whoa they put the gat in your mouth
And we tote a lot of iron to flatten you out
Few roaches but never had no rats in this house

Always been a small hustler moving my packaging out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out
These niggas talking sweet I get them cavities out

Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now I am the prince

She was the sweetest ever
Whatever happened to forever
She never say never, she rather say whatever
I’d rather stay together and she’d rather chase the devil
Now I’m left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several
Turn up the bass and treble
How bout I make it metal
I’m such a fatal fellow
And shes the reason why
Because without the muthafucker I’d die
I’d die, I’d die
So bury me today or tomorrow
Cause I’ve buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I’m resurrected for her nightmares sake

But you love me
At least thats what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying “seek and you’ll be led”
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I’m thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red

But she loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

I used to tell myself I wouldn’t do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I’m losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I ain't acting like I’m supposed
I’m attacking my own soul
I’m back in a lone mode
I’m back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever
I don’t wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart its only dead beat
I’m sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She’s on top, she wanna kiss
She won't stop, she don’t wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever

She loves me, she loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

And I don’t want love, I don’t want love
I don’t wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She’ll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I’m guilty

Got Get Ready To Get Lost You Understand...

Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin'
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch 'er ten g's, tell a bitch to go shoppin'
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See niggas trying to kick it but no I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And off of one ki, I see seventy thousand dollars
Now I was shootin dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with' Yo Gotti he hit five straight points
We over here hustlin, we over here grindin
You rap bout money and a nigga might sign you
Rap bout me and a nigga might find you
Banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya
Dope game bitch, let his momma worry about him
You can holla at me, a fee!


454 up under the hood with the hemi in it
Bend it like acrobatics
Boy, better mind your business
It's about who paper stackin
Grams, I'm packin lincolns
I'm good with the mathematics
Knowin if I get caught
And if we see the cops
Fuck it
Dippin on they ass


Third world democracy
Yeah, I got more records than the K.G.B
So, uh, no funny business
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go




The loser, microphone abuser
Feet hurtin', I just walked from Jerusalem
So you should get on the side with the movement
I'm the proof and I'll die just to prove it
Whatcha wanna know? Anything whatever
I can't tell ya, I can show ya better
Me-me and my gun, we took an oath together
Said I will never die, if we both together
Yeah, this is my testification
I'm Wayne on their hands like precipitation
And in hell you, you need justification
But, but for me it was just a vacation
Heheh, yeah

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

I lost all my money
I lost half my mind
Can't find my direction
Where's the finish line?
Could I be far away from it all?
How far it gone
If I can stay for it all
Then I shouldn't fall

Uhh, but if I fall, I fall up and let the clouds hug me
And if I fall down, I bet I hit the ground runnin'
Bet you search and found nothin', looking for the finish line
Stop short cuttin', you fuckin' up your finish time
Shit, but every twice in a while
It feels like I'm runnin', and life is the miles
Yeah, but until the lights dimmin down
I'll be runnin' around, runnin', runnin'
Ohh, ohh-whoa, will you tell me?

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

Counting all my pennies but it doesn't add up
At the mercy but somehow it ain't enough
Reading all the red lights trying not to give up
But I don't know how long it's gonna last, ohh
It's almost over now
I say it's almost over now
The end is gettin closer now
Better do what you suppose to cause the world is all so short now

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end?
Runnin, run it all!
Yeah! I'm runnin outta time, I'm runnin out of space
Feel like I'm runnin round, but I'm runnin in place
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?



I'm the real, I'm the authentic, the fact and the truth
It's Jae Millz, brown skin, but I'm black in the booth
And for the green or that white, you'll see red
Mushroom bullets hit your body then they spread
Then your ass dead, no need for a hospital room or a bed
Just tell his momma to get him some nice threads
So at least he'll be a bitch ass nigaa dyin' in style
He didn't want to look up to me now he gotta look down
Somebody better tell em on these beats I'm a beast
Half man half animal like king on Tekken
I'll wreck him, hell ya Young Money is what I'm reppin'
Respect em' or I'll put you on that highway to heaven
Matter of fact pussy you'll get your own lane
With no speed limits so you can get there in a minute
It's Dedication 3, there's no replacin' we
That's like askin' a group of Muslims where that bacon be
Straight Grand Patron flow, there is no chasin' me
And that amnesia is what my medication be
That's that Amsterdam grade A,  I'm smokin' in the Netherlands
So high that I'll probably fuckin' never land
Bitch

Muthafuckin' psychopath
Young Money cave men, muthafuck a Geico add
Fo' Fo' bulldog, fuck around and bite yo ass

Got them hoes fallin' like a hundred million dominoes
But I don't eat pizza, I eat pussy when he wouldn't
Holla at ya guala, yeah bitch it's me
Kickin' muthafuckas out the kitchen heat
I'll put you where the fishes sleep
And when they wake, you'll be the fishies feast
Yeah, I'm a shark you see my fin ho
Bullet leave a hole in ya face, not a dimple
Straight from the N.O., it's no problemo
To put a nigga brains on the muthafuckin' window
Ugh, damn right I'm nasty
How I come through in that white eyed Aston
The leather guts and might I add in
It's black on chrome like Darren McFadden
Yeah, and don't be comparin my swag with
These wack-ass niggas thats o-so-swagless
Yeah, and call me Mr. Swag-more
Gotcha girlfriend open like some fuckin' pores
Or open like some fuckin doors, nigga it's fuck you and I'm fucking yours
From the bedroom to the floors...whores



Grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game
And fuckin' blew up

I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game
Now I'm at they head like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up, it's war time
It's Weezy baby, no crying, no lying
These motherfuckers is slippin', they better hold on
They trippin' like Cedric and Solange
I flow like I'm headless, no mind
I can say don't rhyme and it's gonna rhyme
I'm so fresh, I should be smacked like Dee Barnes
And you get smacked like a baseball by B. Bonds
I'm to the point, I could kill a nigga with three lines
Watch this
With, three, lines
We got that Tussin and blunts is dipped three times
We light them motherfuckers up and get tree high
And in the game I'm manning up like Eli
R.I.P B.I


Believe that
I say, I say believe that
I got my nigga Tity Boi
Duffle bag boss
Yessir

Gucci belt, Gucci glasses
Four door coupe and the roof no magic
Voila
So don't worry 'bout my other profession
Cause it, I send shots in the other direction
The old me the Rollie, the new me the ruby
Jacuzzi, the movies
The groupies, the two pieces
And all the animals that dearly departed
Know that my mink game is really retarted
I pumped a few packs, caught a few charges
Made a few stacks and drove a few carses
I go to the mall and buy a few closets
The rap Fernando Vargas
Got my hand on my strap
Aimed at my target
Duffle bag boy in some high-top Pradas
Get it, straight killin em'
I push weight and move pack
Duffle bag boys in the front
Young Money in the back




Wake up in the morning take a shit shower shave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave
I whip it like a slave
Whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and then I whip it like a slave

B double O, Ohhhhh

Look how I whip it ohhhh, called child abuse

Enough bricks I can build a townhouse


Okay new day new yay

I'm talking sugar talking dough like a beignet
I take a brick karate chop it like a sensei
Haha, I does it the YM way
A bunch of drugs, bunch of money, bunch of templates
Bunch of ice, bunch of guns, bunch of switchblades
Fuck with my bunch of bunch of niggas up in his face
Check my pockets more money than lint
Check my kitchen every spoon in there bent
Check my dishes residue like a bitch
Big boy weight my residue like half a brick

Building snow mountains
More bricks than 24 houses

Greedy eye, never full, getting fat

Scratch y'all niggas off the face of the Earth
Even Mase came back for the money outta church
So with that on my mission for that money, I'mma work
My divine intervention might be in that woman's purse
Tryna find a better system, but I'm running out of perks
Baby daughter tummy irks, then daddy heart hurts
So daddy pop at 'em until they heart burst
For my baby girl candy I make her starburst
9/11 was a fucking shame, I done saw worse like
What if that bullet would have hit my heart first
Life, would it be different, I be still fuckin' 'round with death
Cause I got shot after that, and after that I grab the empty case
And then tried to throw that bitch back at they faces, Cita I made it
My nigga Real was on the ground like "naw", I got up and looked around, and grabbed the spot like "ahhh..."
I"m hard to kill, hardy har, cut the music back up and keep the party goin'
Fuck 'em, and I don't need no crease, I'm a motherfucking gangster off Eagle Street
I don't need the Hot Boys, I still keep my heat
And I ain't gotta squad up, I still keep my feet
They call me Michelangelo, you paint them so street
And you and I know what's goin' on, you probably riding to a different song
I'm probably riding on some different chrome, I'm probably high in a different zone
But when I'm off, we can get it on
I take no days off catch that shit for my friend
I clock out when I punch in, I'm shootin
Reel you ain't gotta block out, it's goin' in 'em
Them rats stop hatin' on the snake, the boy venom
The cat like Payton for the Lakers gon' win 'em
I'm certified stamp, I'm a champion
Like Buju Banton, I shoot you nine times like you was Fifty
But you won't be as likely as Fifty, I light me some Piffy
Light hella bright on the Infi, like what nigga, like me or lift me
I don't duck I be right in the city, for them bucks
I take me a flight, and come and get right, right in ya city
Yup, I'm just like Diddy, and nothing like Puff yeah
I'm something like city, he something like Young Wizzy
My Nike's is spiffy, I'm hardly a Gotti
I'm slightly a Nitti, all of a Carter
Bitch niggas never bitch me, bum niggas never ditch me
Shit I gotta get me, man I'm raw, slip me
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity, this moment of honesty
Ain't no more squad in me, unh

Murder my enemy love thy brother
And I ain't never gave a shit about a motherfucker
Hit him up and watch the guts come up out a youngin stomach
You niggas better take side with young money, Cash Money
You'll get left in your ride crash dummy

The magazine empty and the nine stop busting

I got the hood with the names of the crew on they t's
And I might make a funeral sweep, I ain't bullshitin
AR hit ya truck got ya hood flippin
Feet by the engine, head by the transmission
And I be right where I am mista

In this world alone, so bring it on
And imma have to sing you this song nigga

I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head
I wish a motherfucker would trip this year

Say Bang! Bang! say breathe deep breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his chest...Clear!
Now the boy is a mess and the block in fear cuz ya boy up and left

Yea, but she always say, but she love my style
And if I stay out late I'm coming home rich
Thinking bout that pussy on the grind got me home sick
Them dollar signs on my mind got me on this
If I don't hustle then what happens in the morning
Do the sun even rise, do the birds sing
When I can stand over the stove and make the birds sing
You think about that I'll be right back, ring
There she go baby call right back click, ring
Then she call right back click, ring
I toss the phone in the back, quick think
Shit you all I got, but if you leave me where you left me than be on that clock
Gettin' it, and when a nigga hittin' it you lovin'
No crying no fussing, just a simple I'm coming
So when you baby boy out there running
Don't cry don't fuss it's simple I'm coming

I know what he does
But that's my baby
And I love him, I love him yall

Yea, I roll up on her in that earth toner
She can smell the work on me when I work on her
I see through that smurk on her, it hurts sort of
But I been in to deep since my first order
I just tell her don't expect the worst
She say she don't wanna be stuck standing next to a nurse
I say I don't wanna be stuck standing next to a curb
She said she don't wanna, I say shut up you pressing my nerves
She say, who you telling shut up, then she get up
Start packing her shit up, start calling her sister
Sister dosen't pick up, the tension start to pick up
She crying, she got hiccups, I'm tellin her to cheer up
I'm laying down she tell me sit up, I sit up
She push me down I sit up
She push me down I get up
Then I act like ima hit her
But I'm a better nigga
She can't find a better nigga, nah


I think about you when I'm riding dirty
Said I love you for I left, I hope you heard me
Case I never make it back, I hope you heard me
And if you ever have twins name em bright and early
Cause I'm up for the money I hope you down with it
No this ain't game but I can be found in it
And why be in it if I'm not gon win it
So I be playing til the last minute, you don't get it
See that ground hurt when you hit it, I wouldn't lie baby
But fuck with me and you forever fly baby
So far from the buttom I swear
Smell the work in the air, I'm there
You can never take that from me
And what I been through you can't take back from me
If I offend you then mama get back from me
But if you love then I know you coming back for me, you love my style

So when you see me, you ask me where the dope at
You wanna see me
Hey, you gon' need some more cash
I can't even hold a conversation with your broke ass
You ain't got more money than me
Think about it
Let's just say someone gave me a check
And took the ink up out it
Now all I can do is go to the bank about it

Hey, after you back it up then stop
Drop it like it's hot
Hey mama, pop that pussy then shake that ass
Drop it like it's hot
You gotta wobble-de-wobble and then
Drop it like it's hot

I got a sense of humor
But ain't shit funny
I see 'em get mad
But I just get money
My AK a bit runny
So you should either sniff or get hit from it
You get hit runnin'
Hate that I did something
If I did, let me know
I could get a lot of bitches
But my bitch could get me more
Different hoes, got 'em walking on their tippy toes
Talkin' with they pussy holes
Conversation, rule the nation
Here we go, I'm in Bal Harbour
Like give me those
Little man, I ball harder
My car's larger
I'm going farther than y'all could ever pardon
Sharpen my toothbrush, rush the fucking warden
Yeah, I'm part of a mobb daddy
And dyin' behind the sign
Is part of my job, mama
I'm hard as a rock
I'mma fuck me a thick bitch
Throw a CD at her
She drop it, dismissed, you got me


I go by Young Carter, father of one daughter
Bought her a cellphone, I call her every morning

Bought everybody's with my second
Call me Mr. Deeds
Hey Marley, twist the weed
Lauren, hold the pistol, please
Promethazine got me leaning like 6 degrees

You see the guns I got
You know the cops ain't packin' these
They call me Weezy Baby
Please say the "Baby," baby

Y'all know the Birdman

Only on the right side
Fuckin' with them Bloods now

Then ring the alarms
The Carter 2 was nice

Represent the road I grew up by
And I see the game like an umpire
Motherfuck one time, and everything combine

The ballin’ is no illusion
Paper tall as a tower

I’m feeling like a gun with a bag of gun powder
Pow Pow I’m higher than Mister Charles
Fresh from the bottom of the ant pile
Weezy
Uh..

My grill is gangsta, my aim is money
The championship is beautiful but the game is ugly
They say “Feed the hungry” but these bitches is greedy
But I am awfully gifted I am simply strategic
It’s, come to my room I make her feel like it’s Egypt
And she leave out that room feeling like a paraplegic ha
My fuck game is my capital feature
I stuff her ass up like a pair of new sneakers
Back to the subject at hand
Baby, I’m a wealthy ass young black man
Flow more rare than finding black sand
And I just want some brain like a fucking cat scan
I just want some paper like a fucking trash can
Life is a maze, so hows it hanging pac man
I seem to amaze, as well as advance
I’m so far ahead I gotta save the last dance

Get it strait like pans as I enhance
M.O.B I’m all about my chips like Lance hehe
I be with animals, with animal tactics
I swear I’m backed up like New York traffic ha
You dumb fucks, you're nothin’ but lunch ducks
Big nuts here swinging like nunchucks
Hollygrove I’m claiming it like insurance
I been on the grind nigga you are just a tourist
Flowers for the dead, say hello to the florist
Fuck with me wrong, bet I rush ya like Borris
Now they tryna kick it but I ain’t Chuck Norris
I kick it with lil flu and he rollin’ up a forest
Can’t be compared no, I’m not a thesaurus
Can’t be banned I’m sorry Miss. Delores
Fuck Wendy Williams the bitch look like a dude
Her body look chewed and her hair looks glued
But let me get back to my food
Eat the track up and leave the mic barbecued
Why in 30 lives would you ever war with I
I’m just getting high, thinking bout Tha Carter V
My homie’s straight, my mama good, and my daughter's fine
And everyday I pray and thank the great Lord of mine
Weezy Baby you're looking at greatness
Gangsta Grillz no braces bitch
Bitch



Bitch I'm Mack Maine
And this Young Money
Lil brotha get 'em

Straight out the hood a young hoodlum
Done what I shouldn't did what they say I couldn't
Hid where all the killers hid at
Hung where the other hustlas slung at
Waiting on the get back
Get that

Debating on the mix match
Switch that from dope to coke I'm blowin up fast
Now you niggas is slowing up fast
Now my niggas is blowin up aves
If I tell 'em you niggas is holding up cash
Rollin up stepping outta the phantom's ass
Put cha litters away ur talking to a can of gas
There's nothing to say no matter who comes to ask
And murder ain't funny but we do love to laugh
Shit we just living take money take baths
Take a nigga bitch and fuck her
And send her back wit nothing
Now isn't that disgusting
Give him back his sista give him back his cousin
Yea, go make a stack or something
Go and buy yourself a spine and give back the frontin'
Yea and to end that discussion
I been had strength I just got the muscle
Fuck ya, this that 'n' the other
I see my people struggle wish that they wasn't
The government try to put us in a muzzle
But you're two fingers ain't the pieces to da puzzle
Shit say to each his own hustle
And I hustle all night and then go home to the fussin'
Then wake up to the fuckin'
Breakfast in bed don't forget my english muffin
Hawaiin punch tastes like robitussin
A nigga jus livin jus breathin jus puffin'
Come on mama drop down and curl up
Dick millimeter cock back and murda
Aye senorita we cannot go any further
If my girl catch us both in the spot she will merk us
Pussy niggas talkin all that slop we will merk cause
Hungry ass niggas I tote two hamburgers
Who want beef? Who want beef? I bring it to your front door and now you seem nervous
Two seater swervin'
Traffic to hell wit it
Shit you can't die with it can't go to jail with it
Might as well wild in it passin and feelin' it
Me I excel fishtail and tailwhip it
Give them niggas somethin' to tell them bitches
Smellin like money at a full court scrimmage
The fam at the table got a four course dinner
Young money cash money dump confetti on da winner
And yet he understood us so when we told em' break it off
Cause gangstas don't' talk one word'll be a war
And yo platoon can't handle the destruction
Hard body baby killin' sound like seduction
Them niggas chase dope bitches follow the instructions
Sometimes you gotta put the whole rooster in the oven
So tell the public I'mma do my thing
Just as soon as I hear dat bing
Gotta come in
Comin' up
You niggas jus runner up
And runnin' up'll get you in that wheel chair forever
It's whatever
I'm still here forever
Cause the lil'nigga better than all you niggas together

Hello world!

I'm on an Island, and I'm lookin for Gilligan
Where my Timberland?I got 'em tremblin'
Can't find my keys, but I know, I hear them jingling
You're such a Marilyn - Monroe and Manson
I'm got some heroin, wanna go dancing?
You at the door? Ok, I'm about to come down
I'm getting numb now, don't let me come down

I'ts like I'm sippin on tha temple

Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite

Young Moola, baby!
I come thru this bitch,wrist bluer, than 'cuz'
I'm so five star,Soo Woo to the bloods
And before I had a mirror, I knew who I was
I know where I'm goin', I knew where I was
Yeah, dat da da dirty, dirty south, see my shoe full of mud
Baby who can you trust?Who can you love?
When love kills, like somebody gave Cupid a gun?
And sometimes the solution, is execution for some
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one, a.m
And the conclusion, is you losing a son
No inducing my funds, I smoke tha fruitiest blunts
I mean the stupidest buds, I get stupid as duh
I swear my doobie is uh---fat, and just like it, you can get lit
Shit don't stank, when you shittin' in the bank
When her man run an errand, I'ma hit her like Hank
Look him in the eye, and a nigga might blink
Aim at his brain, and a nigga might think
Weezy


Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite

Yo, It's the President man, and the Mistress, Ms. Nicki Minaj. Aka Nicki Lewinsky. Yea. And I am the president, shut yo mouth!



"I didn't step on the flag on purpose! It's a scene in a video where the flag drops behind me and after it drop it's just there as I perform"





The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Stepping to the bad side today

Real nigga, I just can't be fake
Fake niggas they just can't be real
Hot boy I just can’t be chilled
So hot I'm a walking kettle
Man these boys can’t get on my level, they never could
All white phantom directing it through the hood
Real soft leather my dash is cherry wood
Big four 5th that’s working very good
Got a driver named Wood-row
Opens the door, Sui - ci - dal
He holds the umbrella, I hops outta the back
And tell Rosa Parks it’s where I sat
I'm a dog but I'm like a cat to a rat
If he don’t run he get scratched Rrrrraaaaooo
And when it comes to the 4 stain
I'm like old school Harlem shit, that Rich Port thang
I gave him narc
I gave him crack
Now it’s time to introduce him to morphine
You're playing with the wrong one
My mama had 4 boys, you're playing with the wrong son
They say Ladies Love Cool J
Well the J is for Juelz and the ladies love me
And if the bitch ain’t fine
I don’t mind
2 nickels make a dime every time
These boys acting like worthless hoes
But their career is like the car they be in, the curtains closed
They want war let’s get it now
They want beef I give them a cow
You don’t wanna get on my bad side
I leave them with no neck like fat guys
Don’t be playing with me, I ad-vise
I make them Chinese food, another cat fried
And don’t compare them to me there is no comparison
I'm from another planet like aliens
Shark In The Water, there is no scaring them
These fish belong in aquariums
So keep acting like Conan boy and we will see who is the real barbarian
They acting like bad pets and yes I'm a veterinarian
You don’t wanna see me act mean
And don’t watch me I'm not a flat screen
I'm Pay-Per-View you know what that means
You gotta pay for this BITCH!!

Let’s Go
Hard body I can’t even bend
Nor fold I'm cold like the wind
Or North Pole I froze all my limbs
Too much ice I'm a walking bezzle
That’s why you niggas couldn’t get on my level and never could
All Black Phantom directing it through the hood
Black butter soft my dash is black too
My driver is black too
My driver is strapped too
Lil Wayne I'm live as Act 2
But this is no movie script
More like an Uzi clip
I'm into Uzi clips
Spit like an Uzi
I spit like I just jumped into Uzi clips
Nigga who is you with
I can move your clique
All I got to do is let loose with this Uzi clip
I'm an Uzi bitch
Know the rules and shit around here we wear red like a Hoosier bitch
Now after that there comes a smell
And after that welcome to hell
I hope your situation comes to well
Cause I will bust your ass like a lobster tail
I put it into her mouth like Akinyele
And me I get high like a doctor bill
So I sha – ll
Fuss with the kitchen, telling me he ain’t got no pot to sell
17th ward is where I prevail
And I run them streets like a soccer field
You looking at hot for real
And I'm rolling on this bitch like I popped a pill
And I don’t mean David, when I say it, when it comes to marijuana I will cop a field
Just tryna get my proper meal and eat my shit at the top of the hill
That’s the good side
Never look back it’s ya bad side
You on the bad side
Hey, and you don’t wanna see my bad side
You would wanna be my ally
And I believe that I can fly
Not like R.Kelly, he a damn lie
Weezy
Write it in the sand, I hope the wind doesn’t blow for eternity



I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
We're apart and away
And it feels so stray
N.G.E. wouldn't you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could


I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to

"do it again"

Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But I'mma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud

Then ill be there to catch you
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didn't do before
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could


Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And im just wishin
We could

Uh, yeah, yeah
Hot Spitta, Spitta, Fly Society
Young Money y'all, Young Money y'all
Yeah

Figured it's time that I step back from the game
And peep it from a coach's point of view
So I can see how niggas went wrong and how the players was wrong
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit
The line of scrimmage is waiting
Niggas is blitzing, you could get sacked quick
Drop back like an all star QB
Or the top on that high-end sports car with two seats
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry
Looking for vehicles and accessories
Like I do, and every representor of my crew
I get love from Cuz and the Piru
Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out
The police is peeping me and they don't think that I can see
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out
But I'm on to 'em
Spray the chronic-killer and talk calm to 'em
"Good day officer, what's the problem?"
You looking for answers? I don't got none
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga

Hahaa, I know that's right
Hello world, yeah
Yeah, uh huh, music to fly to coming soon y'all

You can see me on the, Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world make it walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded, I'm on some special ed shit
The magnificent twist it like a dread bitch
And I can get up in the car and drive
And if the record is a smash, I can still survive
Yeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me
Shit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be
And, no I never choke but I strangle beats
And, I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are female dog, you don't fight
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga, I got all my masters
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga...



Mic check
One, two
On the way to third
Flow sick
Put a straight jacket on my words
So sick
They think that something's in the herb
They think I'm gone
But I'm fine
Like a woman’s curves
My personality
Is far from your reality
I'm closer to your girl
Now come on ho, don't embarrass me
There is no comparison
This right here be kerosene
Carousel, parasail
I'm higher than everything
What I spit
You can't drink it, like you're 17
I can show a million pair of eyes
What they’ve never seen
And I can do this
In whatever the weather brings
Picasso couldn’t paint a better scene
Colossal
Now give me the mic
And I rock like a fuckin fossil
I'm mad at the track
And I beat it like Hector Camacho
What's poppin?
What it do?
What's happenin'?
What's crackin'?
Que pasa?
The hospital
Mi casa su casa
I'm rad
And these niggas just squares like plaid
And if they’re cool
Then I'm cold
I gets money all day
Like the toll
Bitch

And you are just a stain, bitch
You will fade away
And I only leave my house to paper-chase
Yep, off to the jungle
Where I feel safe
Like a home run
In the bottom of the 9th inning
And I'm fresh
Like I'm by Mennen
I'm on the clock like 5 minutes
Tryin' to get passed the line of scrimmage
Yeah, and before I leave her thighs bendin'
She give me face first, like she done dived in it
And if she tall, I can climb in it
I usually don't have a time limit
And eatin pussy ain't a crime, is it?
If so
I should start working on my jail visits
You know
I'm in the game, they just sell tickets
Man, I got old bread, like stale biscuits
You feeling froggy, all you gotta do is yell 'Ribbit'
Turn ya ass to a statue, like an exhibit
Now lets get it

Leave my cage open
With no pyro

Yes, it's Weezy F, bitch
The best thing since breath, bitch
Suffocate

I'm bout to murder this shit

Yezzir

Operation shutdown
Wake up to polices
Go to sleep to the gun sounds
And you're not a gorilla
You're a dead monkey
Cuz I got a banana clip
In these Red Monkeys
What you said? Don't be
Afraid to say it twice
And they say life is cheap
Until you pay the price
It's just like shaking dice
Better hope you roll a winner
And if you are a rat
You're just a cobra's dinner
Y'all ain't fuckin with me
You niggas under a G
Like the light part of my feet
And so what them niggas left me
When it get cold, I turns into Wayne Gretsky
I do's it like it never been done
So you can suck my dick with a elephant's tongue
Bitch

Motherfucka I spit rabies

You know them hoes love Weezy, say he cute, small, long hair, big dick

Put your lips on this dick, let me get on some livin'
Spit all over ya chin, Weezy be on some pimp shit
I see 'em, peep 'em, meet 'em, beep 'em, later on if she ride
G 'em, freak 'em, by the weekend she be fuckin' the squad
I ain't got no loves for broads, I ducks and dodge
I grab 'em on their butts and all
She fucks my dog, slut sucks nuts and all, and nothin' small
This dick make 'em hit the floor and touch the wall
Call my hoes defensive linemen, cause they rush the balls
Never have no picks and chooses, I hits and lose 'em
And go to the hotel and switch for ruggy
Like a hot, spicy, fire, project girl to thug with me
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck wit me

Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some
Tear that dick down bitch, start buggin and
And bungee jumpin'
Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

That's right, act a fool bitch, do what you do, ho
After I finish, don't get up, gotta let Weezy go
You get your props your pussy fire, girl you a pro
So when I'm speakin' I'm creepin' and come get some mo'
You better recognize, you better realize
This is the nigga Geezy, I ain't nothin' nice
Love when you reach out, grab, stuff it straight your mouth
Start suckin 'til that middle come out
After that wiggle your ass gimmie that loose-loose
I'm a donkey, better yet a veteran
At the same time I can fuck you and your best friend
The Number 1 Stunna, Baby he raised me
Pumped in my head - never let a bitch play me
Always get the clique, make you fuck 'em all
Wrap a chain 'round ya neck and walk it like a dog


See me, Lil Wayne I put that dick down, biznites can't even walk, can't even sit down
Wipe your mouth off and let me hit now
That Rum got me feelin' real good
The dick hard like real wood
I put it in slow and work it real good
This Lil nigga have a lot a sex, so do me slow, get out the Prada dress
I Come when you wanted to like private jets
I'm on blast ma', why you take it slower than its fast time
Flip ya back over, make that ass right
Weezy make ya suck it then taste, that's how the pimp play
Make her friend eat me and this bitch up like shrimp plates
Bouncing in the club rollin' on X, eyes pitch black
I got 2 more 'nites is you wit that
Fuck it let's go, we pop a bottle of the Moe'
Drop the top part of the 'Dro
Later on I'm touchin' the throat, bad wit it
Where them hot girls that like that nasty shit
Make them act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it





And that I will
Yess, Gotta get 'em

Fee! Straight up gangsta, Hollygrove gangsta
Lay a nigga down in pink stuff
Them soft ass dudes just think tough
We shoot and put them shanks up
We tryin' live to summer and put them minks up
I'm sinked up in the coupe, the eyes chinked up
Pull up on a bitch at the light, that night linked up
Whole lotta shit in the life of a young boss
Bet that V.V.S. ice will bite your face off
Yeah, I ignite and take off, now catch up
I'm the best doing it, c'mon niggas 'fess up
Nigga feel different he could chess up and guess what
I bring it to his chest, to his right lung and left lung
Nigga get a check up, nigga put ya cheque up
I swear I'm on fire, need water like a hick-up
So I guess I might as well can say that

Yeah, candy paint!
T, I'm ridin' in the peppermint
Even my leather got leather trim
I'm on another element
I keep somethin' in the trunk like a elephant
Bet you remember it, like a elephant
I got this rap bottled up like medicine
Who's better than? Fuck him!
I probably fucked her, ah what's new
And if you hatin' on us, yeah fuck you
And if them bitches wanna fuck us, we wanna fuck too
What a coincidence
And we cause accidents, not incidents
I am big shit, they're inci-wints
They're not even a letter in my sentences
Sittin' in my coupe on 20-inch
So it's like I'm fencing bitch
So stop being defensive bitch
Now end this shit



Now ever since I could remember I been poppin them bottles
Pop, poppin them bottles, pop, poppin them bottles
Now ever since I could remember I been smokin that dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand

When it comes to the bread, I got the keys to the bakery
These niggas out here trippin, sellin ki's to them agencies
My bitch keep saying that the judge got a date for me
I tell the silly bitch and ya honor, they can wait for me
I'm gone in the coupe with the roof steady chasing me
Shine so hard like the fucking sun facing me, basically
Take it how you take it, I be making you be hating me
Loving me but hating me, ho you got to pay for me
Riding in the big boys, sitting on them grown folks
Every time I park, it's a motherfucking car show
I guess I'm the number one Lakers fan
Yellow bottle, yellow bottle, purple bag, purple bag


Well they know me as the Curren$y, but some call me the Hot Spitta
Sittin in the Chevy on three wheels like a tricycle
Always been a fly nigga since I was a little one
Bottle pop like the NBA finals is what we won
I puff a lot of blunts with my nigga Weezy B
One night I was so high I thought that I forgot how to read
Young Money fly boys, mami, weed a different breed
Throwing parties at secret locations somewhere on the beach
We off in Prive, Patron shots for the models
And send a bottle of that Cris' up to the DJ
I live by these rules, only money over bitches
And it been like that ever since I could remember


I just copped me some purp, I'm bout to open up
I put my heart in my prices, see I'mma show you love
See I front you an ounce to get you started clown
And you ain't got to go to Mickie D's for quarter pounds
I be in A-Town, livin' la vida la loca
Throwin that money on chichas, spendin' a stack up in Strokers
Yes I'm an animal, to be frank I'm a dog
If it's that time of the month, baby girl I need some skull
Some mouth and lip service, that'd be perfect
You saw the rims on the Benz and you got nervous
But I'm a G, yep
I pop my collar, hop in Impalas
Ride for the dollars, hit the club
Go straight to the bar and pop my bottles

See my momma is a chef and my daddy was a dealer
Grandaddy was a dealer and my auntie is a killer
I hope she know I love her, pray the pigs never get her
My brother still a baby, and my uncle kinda raised me
Y'all pray for his wife, cause that cancer shit is crazy
And my daughter's so smart that it scares me
Her mother is an angel, she's always there for me
And me, I'm just wild; I think I need therapy
Because I'm going after that money, no matter where it be




Tell it to my nine bitch!

If these guys bad then I gotta be a demon
Wayne's getting money like Damon and Keenen
Try and take it from me and I'm aimin and beamin'
Bangin and leavin
Stains on the cement
Slide the crackers something
So they tame the policemen
Left in a Porsche
Came in a Koenigsegg
I'm fresh yea the Gucci sweats came with the creases
I'm hot but I'm cold
I just change with the seasons
Tryin to put some cheese on my pieces
If you lookin for your nigga

Huggin on that money
Tryin to put it in a sleeper
Yea I'm here
Who the fuck wanna say somethin
Leave your whole head empty

Your girlfriend guzzlin
When you thought she wasn't
Name still buzzin even when I'm doin nothin
But I'm never doing nothin
Cause I'm always getting money
That's simple jackass
If you don't get it your a dummy
And them niggas that diss me
Ain't nothin but pure pussy
Sure honey I done heard what you said
But if a nigga really cared
You'd already be dead
Just some young ass niggas
With some old ass bread
Yes I keep them dollas running
Like them bitches got legs
Now my nigga Tez Po
Been ridin with me since Keds
And my right wrist
Is looking like a cracked open egg
That's white and yellow diamonds
Adjust your lighting
I got 'em so mad but
Oh I think they like me



Oompa loompa doompa dee doo
I've got a perfect puzzle for you
Oompa loompa doompa dee dee
If you are wise, you'll listen to me

They said they did it before Wayne, not like this
Ha, ha, hey
They tryna stop us, Wayne
They can't do it, man, this T-Wayne
Hahaha, hey, hey
If you're fuckin' with Wayne then you're gon' get the T

If you was wise enough to get wise and wise up and listen
You wack niggas wouldn't sound so fuckin' insufficient
I'm fishin' for some bitches to give me some Southern fixin's
This isn't just one of them rappin' R&B niggas
I'm fuckin' with Tha Bizness, some of the hardest beat rippers
Fuckin' with the Wayne then you're gon' get the T
It's like oompa loompa, I am on my new job
Gettin' at your girlfriend, liftin' up her tube top
Call your lady super lube, givin' niggas lube jobs
I'm cold as fuck but I am also what and who's hot
So I'm obligated to authorize what and who's not
You think I'm wack, but one day you're gon' see

Straight out the backseat of the dually with the toolie
I am truly unruly, mic check, one two me
It is Money Mouth Carter, smokin' like runnin' hot water
I am somethin' like a barber 'cause I'll cut your fuckin' head off
And if I'm in the buildin', I've been mothafuckin' paid off
Let me take my shades off so I can fuckin' see, and bitch
Yeah, shawty got that rebel rap
Like where-where-where your shovel at?
I take a trip to hell and nigga, I'ma bring the devil back
And if you want some trouble, I can have my people schedule that
This ain't no Nintendo rap 'cause I don't play no games
Bitch, I murder, kill, rob, steal, and fuck on the same watch
And I got that auto, that's that T-Pain kind



Pardon my gang affil
But you’re stepping on a Rodney Dangerfield
Weezy Baby, how do the Manger feel?

Young Money
And thats perfect cause perfect is to me

So capitalise the P cause perfect is Godly
Black Wall Street, the perfect family, The Cosby
All I need is a perfect bitch
How’s B, I passed the baton on Solange
I’m sure like Al B
But a bougie B would never give me the perfect P-I-R-U
Hello Brooklyn I can’t see, cause if I did
I'd be S-U-double O-P D-O-double G
Cut it in half and you will see
That this Philadelphia 'P' sit on my head
Like a low Ceaser, wear it to the hood and get me street cred like Four Visa’s
Niggas fucking with Weezy, I will slow leak em
Hang em from a telephone pole like my old sneakers
Red bandana for no reason
Put Weezy on and that N-O bleedin’, yeah


Can’t stop the red bandana, even if you put me in a cage full of orangurtan’s
I’ll show you how bangers bang
Four five cocked back, move the crowd like Dana Dane
Switch plates, paint the Range
Leave so much blood on the wall look like the fucking painters came
Dead wrong ain't it man
I told niggas I ain't a Game
All black gold chain, looking like the saint is playin’
He sold a milli, I’m Vanilli
So it ain't a thing to make it rain in a hundred dollar bills
We throwing paper planes
Riding through the N.O
Red Marc Jacob frames
We disappear like David Blaine
And pop up at the Lakers game
They playing the C’s with Paul Pierce Throwing The B’s
That make the ref affiliated, everytime he hit a three
Ken Griffey lost all his fans, taking off his red top
Bloods in New York like Manhattan took a head shot
I’m one blood, he’s the Carter with the dread locks
My whole team run base, we the fucking Red Sox




Ok I'm leanin' to the left, flag in my right pocket
Star Trek fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial, I'm all about my decimals
Retarded in the booth, they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda spit crack and you niggas is crack addicts
It's simple mathematics; you cut the check
And I rake in the green like I'm rakin' the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near faint when they passin'
Call my whip Martin, but the first name Aston
Potatohead niggas get mashed when I'm spazzin
Think you fuckin' with me? Put your cash in
Nah, I doubt it;
I was young and reckless when Pete say he was about it
You niggas is Ducks, Howards, Cowards
Kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
This rap shit is ours, Gudda, bitch~!

Uh, Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis', black semi'
I've never sat in the Hemi, that will offend me
Try Maybach or Maybach, bitch I got stacks

I still don't play that, I kill on ASAP
And we don't do shit but get money all day
Put some shoes on my bullets now they runnin' your way
YM, Young Mula, Young Money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama? I'm honored
I blitz yo' ass like a mothafuckin' lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of commas
Still wear red like an old 49er
Fuck shittin' on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya
Weezy F baby, bitch I'm hotter than Uganda
Uggh!

Let-let go
Mo-momma ain't make me to make homies, she made me to make history
So doin that my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and my target is the industry
Two things in the world I love - good head and victory
You ain't doin' it big, I'm grown, stop kiddin me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr. T
This is Misery, no Kathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money'll slap you straight
Yeah, I'm a big joker so you know I'll smash your ace
Leave the club with ya girl send her home with a ashy face
Love is a gamble, but it's my casino
And tonight you're the loser, I hope she got Aveno
I hope the game got life insurance cause I'mma kill it
And all you whack ass rap niggas dyin with it
I'm so Harlem, eatin but still starvin'
Po-pockets fat as fuck like all they do is eat margarine
Millz!

Say, put the flow in the pot, crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top, this finger lickin hot
His pick flip cause the nigga flopped
My shit hit like the pitch was soft, niggas cottonballed
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy crossed guard but, I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fuckin law
Her baby daddy gone, who wanna meet the Don?
That Rocky shit up on the arm-arm
Shittin on 'em like hay in the barn
Hey wait they say Money talks and, man you don't speak at all
You shop at mini-malls
My style two thumbs up like using analogs
Ha ha~! I wreck shit for the recognition bitch
Jesus as my witness, Saan vision
Eyeball you niggas, flame flicker
I melt pictures, Tyga skin ain't drippin



Drought 3
Yessir
Look

I bought it out
Like Stunna
I hope when we kiss
We make you sick
To your stomach
Stuntin' like my daddy
And your momma eat rubbers
I bet that I can do
The mouth to mouth with your woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring
Looking like a little Funyun
Stand on my toes
You can call me Paul Bunyan
Switchin' up my flo's
Like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet
'Cause my words' like seduction
And when we on the jet
You don't come up in the discussion
And if you say you ballin'
We probably don't trust ya
And I know plenty freaky hoes
That probably won't fuck ya
Even if you paying, boy
They probably won't fuck ya
Only if I say that she can touch ya
Like Busta
But she might crutch ya
And burn ya
Like Usher
Me and my clique be in red, like Russia
I shit these rappers out
And sometimes I forget to flush ya
Grandaddy Purp or Bubba Kush crush ya
Explode in a bitch mouth like a Gusher
Cash Money, Young Money
Check the production
I am just a Martian
Get prepared for abduction

I walk it out
Like crutches
Two girls jump me
Like Double Dutches
My nigga T-Streets
Know a girl named Dutchess
And every time he see her in the street
She be cussin'
I told him he should wave the black flag
'Cause she buggin'
He said "The pussy good"
He said "Ya dig?" So I dug him
I'm looking for a real bad bitch
With a husband
I'll give her much dick
And a whole lot of nuttin'
I'm spittin' like I stumbled
On a gold pot or somethin'
And when I was six
I saw my role model hustlin'
So I got a hustle
These rappers talking 'bout
A whole lot of nothin'
You dropped me on Saturday
I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the arguing 'bout?
Nigga, Tha Carter out
This is what I call a Drought – 3
And we don't walk it out
We drop-top Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out
Before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out
We chalk it out
We chalk it out
We chalk it out
We chalk it out
We chalk it out
We chalk it out
We chalk 'em now
They don't want it, uh-uh
No, they don't want it, uh-uh
You see, they phony, I'm not
Oh yeah, they phony, I'm not
I Eastside walk it out
I bring New Orleans out
I am a Saints fan
Oh yeah we marchin' now
Like we're a Saints band
I play the organs now
And if they talking
Most likely I'm what they talking 'bout
My nigga T from the East
Roll up that forest now
Man, I'm just trying to get my Peanuts
I'm like Charlie Brown
OK, that Uzi make a Harley sound
Take two of these and walk around
Come straight from that homeless town
This game belong to Carter now
Bitch



All my niggas if you with me
All my soldiers if you with me
All my hustlers if you with me
Niggas if you with me
Soldiers if you with me
Hustlers if you with me

I come and do my thang and hold down my side
Eagle Street man throw my set up high
Weezy we gang call them boys that squad
That squad, squad up! you know
And we get a lot of dough on the strength of me
Get a lotta dro on the strength of Fee
Get a lot of blow
But keep that on the D
D what?...DL! you know
And oh you don't wanna fuck with a nigga
'Cuz a nigga might fuck with the trigger
Leave a nigga on the floor
Truly I don't buck with you nigga
Let my tooly talk, talk to you nigga
Bitch man is an itch to a rich man whoa
'20s on the six with the kicks sitting low
Sticky in my swish man gasoline floor
Fire spit man Weezy is about to blow
Ya know!


Pass the pine to the pimp old juice killer
Catch your eye in one glimpse old school with the
Ass up high the front dip drip bam
Mami like damn, Lil Wayne stop playing
Baby I'm a baller I hustle with my father
It's the Birdman and Birdman Jr
I flip them birds man eighteen grand just order
Eighty-five for half and forty-five for quarter
Yeah! Tity baby put it in the air
I'm jumping out this atmosphere
And I'm jumping in your bitch if she had a player
Jumping in the painted thing on them dang-a-dangs
You see the arm when I pass nigga bang-a-lang
You now I'm armed we can mash man it ain't a thing
You know I'm calm but I'm a gorilla ain't a game
I got a banana clip for all you orangutans
Let's bang!


It's young Weezy can't none see me dawg
I get you done easy with one easy phone call
And the sawed-off make your arms fall off
Like a short sleeved polo, won't bother me no more
Ice like strobe light, look like I'm moving slow mo'
Ferrari look nice on low pro Yokohomas
With '20 inch chromes poking out 'em
Chrissy till the dome tote the ganja
Red-bone in the shower
Hello! Pocahontas give a long stroke poke for hours
Floating vagina hoe, I'mma holla
Sold coke in the '90s,  I'm honest man
Nothing big maybe ounces, grams
But I know how to double, and sometimes it's scams
But I know to hustle, and some Glocks'll jam
But I know how to bust 'em, and some drops'll slam
All alloy buttons that's all stunting
That boy's something
Yeah!




Rolling stocky, kinda brocky on the streets where niggas watch me
If you plotting I'mma prol'ly get to pop at your noggin
I'm a Hollygrove problem, like "Follow me yeah
Come and be my death volunteer,"
That's why I'm here, I come to get that scratch
I done been to jail twice and tell them crackers I ain't never going back, huh?
Rode through the city with the metal on my back, huh?
Gave me a shot and I sent several of 'em back, huh?
Gave me some money, they won't ever get it back now
No more crack now, it's in the back for now
Just in case she crack down
I never back down, shit bitch, I might react now
Where you at clown? I'm high in the sky
You at ground, so set down you bitch you

Money on my mind, pistol on my side
I make a nigga hide that pride
I ain't got time for you bitches, I'm trying get these riches
Real niggas know that vision
I ain't time for you haters, I'm trying get this paper
Real ladies know that labor
I ain't got time for you snitches, I'm trying get them riches
Real niggas know that vision

You motherfuckers know what I'm out here doing
And you ain't gotta buy it, if you not into it
Dope block influenced, blue pale light, scream
I'm on that same ass block letting the bell ring
Looking for the boy, the one in the back
I could get your stomach out of your back
I could make you shit better, this better, than what them selling
They need drugs no penicillin and I'm the medicine man
Yes I am him, yup-yup
Hip-hip, hoo-ray, 20 hard came today
And two large was the pay, and the Coast Guard said it was okay
Bring them barge to the bay
And my bitch looks like a DeBarge so I call her bait
She put packs in her bra, and the keys in the case
If she ever try to skate with the cake, and relocate
I got her social and her birth date, bitch please


I talk like a hustler, walk like a hustler
Stripper attitude, only money make me move
Dapper dan status, I'm the stunner part two
I got an image to uphold, and my image do, too
I'm off the scrimmage line like Emmitt 2-2
Why would the quarterback give it to you?
I gotta hundred sacks, and a hundred women; French twist
And we don't even talk, we just French kiss, I could never get pinched
I'm rocking like a big pimp
Momma only dated hustlers, so I could only commend them
And never roll with a dummy on your hip
Have the judge giving you a run-on sentence
Never that, I keep the gun on for that business
And when I'm not, I'm at business
See that's that, mad business, peep the simplistics
It's Cash Money, nigga, just live it




Now it was me and Lil CC and we was chilling by ourselves
Popped a pill and now I'm feeling myself
All these cuts on my wrist, it's like I'm killing myself
Diamond cuts is what I mean, I'm so hot I might melt
Only in your bitch mouth, nigga whatcha talking 'bout
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking bout this
Don't worry 'bout me, worry bout my bitch
Don't worry 'bout me, worry bout my bitch

I got a bitch named Nina, and Nina's so slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies, yeah
She'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Protection off, safety - I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas Weezy", that's what the .380 said
"I got them niggas Weezy", that's what the .380 said
That's what the .380 said, that's what the .380 said

Man y'all ain't ready
I'll take one -- me and Lil Terry
And we hold court like Mason Perry
Oops, I meant Perry Mason, the weed got me dyslexic

Eat or get ate, and you looking like breakfast

Damn, my bitch sexy

And maybe if you get rich you'll talk this way!
See, right now I'm talking foreign, you dig? I'm talking foreign
Leave a hole in the boy big enough to park a car in
You're on, but you ain't on it, I'm more on like Warren
Move, boom! Now my bitch talking for me
Damn, and she's so slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Man, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies

I think I'm a Spaceship
Girl I gotta drop your ass off
Last night
Ya we were spaced girl
You love it
Girl I gotta take off
Cause I'mma be here next week
So call your company
& take off
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh
Cause she say "Wayne Wayne"
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscious
While I say aloud

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin no one, but yourself
Your like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin no one, but yourself
And so shes gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone

I told her I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much
Thats the problem
"Oh my god" then
Shorty be whillin
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe
All of the things
That she'll do
And all of the things
She'll say to make me stay
And I be like "damn"
I've been that boy for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way
& then I send her on her way


And now she's not pickin' up the phone
I don't know what to do
Thinking about going to her home
Landing my spaceship on her roof
Going through her bedroom window
Only to find a mans shoe on the floor
Ohhh noo, ohhh noo, ohhh noo
And I'm like
"Who am I to blame?"
When she was pleading "Wayne
If you ever leave again
I don't wanna see you anymore."
Hop back in my space ship
Hope that I don't spot you at all
Eh eh oh
Because baby if I see you
I'mma probably knock your ass out
Eh eh oh
Put you in the trunk
Throw him over the bridge, and take off




Holla at ya boy its Weezy Baby
They label me a problem and I probably am so I dont knock em
I pop up in a broccoli Lam' on choppers
With an ol' school bitch, she got on door knockers
And she knock on your door for that raw partner
Hollygrove Wayne, that boy a monster
Jacked for a Mazda come back in Mase-rati
Like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like an I.V
Tryna be monogamous but I got bitches on my dick
Like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
And to my unborn I'm tryna reason with ya moms so
If I'm not with her when you get here, its already clear
Yeah, and for their sake I'm a ball every year
I'm a pause every tear
And tattoo it on my face
Niggas know, that I got that black music on my waist
Make me put it to your ear and get that b-b-b-b-bass
Bluka bluka to ya face, closed casket
Mama can't remember shit but last saturday, what a tragedy
Flowers for the family
Powder in my nap sack
Running through the projects, tryna get a stack back
I got my SK bout to get my MAC back to pap pap at niggas who yap yap
Yup yup! and I rep that 17 hard, you know
'til a nigga ain't nothing but tomb quotes
Raw Tune, who you know go harder than dude
See these is the clues, part of my shoes

Don't move cause you right in the route of the gun mouth
When it talk, you know what come out- barreltone
Nigga y-y-young Wayne from out Carrollton
Yeah, I got my eyes on the sparrow
Though my path is narrow, my angels are shadows
I saddled up, and get the fucking battle
Automatics up, like nigga fuck whoever
You touch and reach, you get fucking bleached
Above the law niggas put you underneath
You call the law nigga? You fucking leech!
You Saved by the Bell, you fucking Screech
My bucket screech through the streets like a R&B singer
You ain't pimping until you fuck a R&B singer
I walked in this building with all these bangers
And all these niggas look like targets to me
What's a drought to you may be a bargain to me
Cause I just may be sitting on a carton of Ki's
I got important people thats trying to market me
So I'm gon' stop talking 'bout the white, Sike!
I know I'm not walking without a fight
So I'm swinging with all my might
We can go all night
I'm a blow all day, and I'm a blow all night
Do a verse today and do a show tonight!
Fuck a ho today, and fuck a ho tonight!
Im' a live my life like there's no tonight
I might go tonight so mama pray don't cry
Cause your prayers maybe working, mama they gon' try
Yeah,and we rock to the same lullaby
Nigga I got 10, nigga I got 5

And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air
I’m on Five-Hour Energy, Nuvo and Hennessy
So what you wanna do little baby

Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

I’m so considerate, I never quit a bitch
No matter how many niggas hit, or how many dick she licked
I please that clitoris, I give her a kiss and shit
When other niggas don’t stay long enough, they get the digits and split
If ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty
That's just because you are and they do not want to admit it
Look at all that ass, you ain't got to have titties
At least you part of the itty bitty titty committee really
You goin let em style on you, or you can let em talk
Hop up in this Lamborghini, baby, go on let em walk
Stop hanging round them stupid bitches, you’d be better off
Them hoes dirty birds, Atlanta Hawks
Go on wear them granny draws
Matter of fact go put that dress on, and don't wear any drawls and come sit on Santa Claus
We can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop
We can go to PC, but you’ll still be my laptop

And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air
I’m on Five-Hour Energy, Nuvo and Hennessy
So what you wanna do little baby

Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

Kiss her on the thigh make her pussy hole cry
They say numbers don't lie, lets try a 69
Kiss her on her lips let her pussy hole drip
She can't even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip
Kiss her on her cheek, make her pussy lips speak
Now she pulling on my locks, kiss, styles, Sheek
Kiss her on her breasts, east and west
And then I go south and clean up my mess
No stop signs, no red lights
She put on a show, no stage fright
And then I fuck her right, and she say fucking right
She climb on top that mountain and ride that mountain bike
She keep it nice and wet, like Armor All,
She keep a close shave like Barbasol
But all in all she’s just Weezy baby

And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air
I’m on Five-Hour Energy, Nuvo and Hennessy
So what you wanna do little baby

Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

I'm married to the money and the power
And still I got guns on my side for my private affairs
Yeah, I know that water get cold but I dive in it bare
And swim through it alive and aware, I been through it
You probably never been to it, so now I dip through it
And they respect me like a pistol, I'm hip to it
I gets to it like just do it, I miss doing it
A hundred shot drum, play 'em some clip music
I am the drum major, the drum section waiting
All it takes is one signal you can get a cadence
You can get it catered, I'm at your service like a waiter
When it's beef, I become a nigga neighbor
I put potatoes on the heater no label later
Now have me make mashed potatoes

I wet em up like rivers, now flow by niggas
I'm drip and dry fly, now squint your eyes bitches
I dimpsy time bitches, hop out of new Bentley's
I'm old school like a loose Winston
Like since when they make bullet proof skin?
I put it to ya chin, and grin, and sin, and then
I sin again, and then I'm gone in the wind
And I'm dumping my Scarlett O'Hara in the canal
Cause I'm not getting stopped wit cop paraphernal'
Now I preparing a L, not preparing to fail
Cause my flow is for real like the Sahara in hell
Comparisons is irrelevant, I'm an arrogant male, yeah
I can handle it, I can graduate Yale, yeah
They featherweight, I sporadically ill
The fuck out and you can automatically killed, yeah
Peep the narrative of the New Orleans heritage
You can go get your evidence, I tell where and tell you when
I was prescribing medicine, you was getting your lesson in
I was getting my adolescence in
Lesser than God only, better than my last that's what strive for
Dwelling on my past I get high
So I light it up and smoke
Keep that Mary Poppins poppin' like a toaster
I'm Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Can't forget that purple potion, oh shit
You ho niggas is ass that's ho shit
So shit, I blow bigger in MASH and laugh

I'm the best, no shit
Weezy



Wayne, I'ma hold you down on this rap shit, mane

Ha, once again it's on
My respect level now is unheard of
Niggas was laughin', now they wish they never heard of 'em
Now they gon' learn to respect me, bruh
A lick a shot, 9 millis get burned in their retina
Have that lead come out the back of your head
One word is what I said, click clack and you're dead
Put one more of them claps in the back of your leg
I hit ya arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Damn, if you was just a virgin to Pain
Just think of me as the R&B version of Wayne
But since he doin' the same thing now it's no difference
Ice grill, hood niggas put your dentures in

Look up in the sky and see me courting with a cover girl
She know that in spite
After I'm through then it's another girl
I can make your wife and your sister fuck your brother girl
Rockstar biatch
Check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip hop it must be knee hop
I'm higher than a motherfucking chronic leaf treetop
I make that Nina sing like shoody-do-dee-wop
You want the facts, Daddy
Well I truly do me, Pop
And I get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Still get a stomachache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker cause we not
Yeah you bitches better run till your feet stop
And I'm so fed up with street cops
I'm colder than a ski shop
I'm holding onto the top
And even if I let go
I still won't d-rop

I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time
I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line
I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
I am not a human being

Rockstar baby
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw baby
I can knock your boots and your socks off baby
News flash, your boyfriend a knock off baby
Okay real shit, he can get knocked off baby
And I'm like a champagne top
I'm ready to pop off baby
You really lucky I don't kill if it's not for Baby
Got so much money
I can look at the cops all crazy
Rockstar shit from my rockstar ass
Got a tub full of money, that's a rockstar bath
Then I use more money to wipe my rockstar ass
Then I throw it in the garbage, that's rockstar trash
I wouldn't try you
I wouldn't lie dude
I'm must be sticky cause them bitches got their eyes glued
Big B bitch
I'm so motherfucking damu
Staring at a mountain like
Bitch, I will climb you
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9'2"
I scream motherfuck you and whoever designed you
And if you think you hot then obviously you are lied to
And we don't die, we multiply and then we come divide you


I'm rockstar bad
With my rockstar glasses and my rockstar plaid
This the school of hard rock
I'm a rockstar grad
And my kids are proud to have a rockstar dad
Now Mama, let them titties bounce like rice on glass
And if you do I'll probably call you like shots off glass
Don't jump into my water cause you're not gonna last
I swear I'mma be like a shark that's not gonna pass
Rockstar life, rockstar bright
And in the mosh pit is how a rockstar fight
So jump up in this bitch and catch a rockstar right
And the cops could never violate a rockstar's rights
Yeah, now I'm back on my grizz
And y'all's a bunch of squares like a motherfucking grid
And everybody get it, well me I get rid
Of he who say he get it and then I get his
No marquee but this is big biz
And I scream fuck it, whoever it is
Ain't no motherfucker deeper than me, bitch dig
And I thank God everyday that my children are rich kids






Back the hell off!
Rock and roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers somethin to feel on
Rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on
And let's roll down the hill 'til the hill gone
I started on the block but that's somethin to build on
And how can I pray when I got nuttin to kneel on?

Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

Huh, walk on air
Show me to the edge and I walk off there
We ain't high enough, au contraire
And sometimes life just don't compare
Sa-say my name, baby pull my hair
And I'mma fuck you like a bull, I swear
I got a lot of love that I could just share
I got a lot of drugs that I could just share!!
I-I-I know, I know, what'chu like girl
A nice little mirror and a little white girl
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing
May I be everything but grounded
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float...

Listen up, Princess

I wake up in the morning
Take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
But alone is steroids, cuz it made me strong
Girl, hurr gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son
Baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rear-view
And I put that ring on your finger
I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn


Yo, I love my niggas; no homo
I swear I hope all get cheese like Digiorno
It's something 'bout the Hot Boyz that you don't know
I gotta love for em that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front door
I hope Chopper City Records blow
Fa sho'
And me and Juve never really got along
But you still would let yo nigga come get on yo hottest song
Damn, I fuck wit ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissin me on the mixtape
Cause he's locked up, and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin

And so, now
I've become the President of the spot y'all left me at

Drop out from heavens like, just to raise plenty hell
Boy I’m tryna touch a billion bucks before 2012
So that mean I’m focused
Beat my demeanour
These bitches talking dirty to me
Take ‘em to the cleaners
They say men are from Mars
Say women from Venus
But I’m in my space shuttle
Bout to serve em like subpoenas

They only show they guns, Gilbert Arenas
Wassup Serena, you could be my baby momma
I’m with Barack O-Drama
This Young Money’s Obama

And if they gettin' money then, we will paper chase them
With beams that glow in the dark like Kanye's stage shit
Then we highjackin' Kanye's spaceship
And land it on the Red Carpet at the VMA's bitch


To live and die in LA, it's the place to be

Drink it all, I’m dead, so I throw some ice in it
And belch when I finish

Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon

Uh, its the martian and I come for all
I swear I will go head up with all y’all, bumper cars
Nigga I’m a slumber dog, millionaire, been there
Smoke some kush and snap my fingers in case you got cat lives

Suicide flow, go and kill ya self, Seven Pounds
Blunt thick as Bobby Christina, high as Serena’s skirt
Only smoking that real grass, no arena turf
Now can I live and if I can, I rep that dirty south
And you haven’t seen cleaner dirt, you haven’t seen it worse
So shut the fuck up and steam the purp
Tell them haters “arrivederc”

And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me

Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you

So I live my life in dedication of you dog

And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own

Beat the beat up 'til the beat get punchdrunk
Drown in my flow motherfucker bring your swimmin' trunks
Everybody say they just do it, well I just don't
Times do change motherfucker but the gun don't
Woke up this morning with my dick to the ceilin'
Fell asleep with another chick from my buildin'
Kick her ass out and have breakfast like a muh'fucker
I'm with another bitch by supper
Yeah, me and hate that's an odd couple
Hehe, you niggas fake you wouldn't pop bubbles
You can act stupid, bitch I'm dumber
And T. Barker is my motherfuckin drummer

You want me to take you for a ride, well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh-uh uh-uh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm fallin down a landslide, on a one-way trip to you

I been doin' this shit
And you know what they say about the shoe if it fit
Have a ball 'til I fall though
And if I die today I bet the world end tomorrow
It's fucked up how you ain't never me, and I got blind money, money you will never see
And only in the mirror is where you'll find a better me
I make money and my fingers make the letter B
I'm very sick, very sicker than you
And when I play sick, I'm Jordan with the flu
Then I become a motherfucker, and my nigga Travis Barker is my drummer
Motherfucker let's go

I'm fallin' down a landslide, on a one-way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride, well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh-uh uh-uh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm fallin down a landslide, on a one-way trip to you

I get better with time and time is forever
So just sit back and watch my time get better
So check your watch, I'm strong as Scotch
Poppa was a rollin' stone, I was born to rock
Tell it like it is, shit I don't know when it isn't
To be or not to be; shit, I don't know my decision
I don't know how I made it for this long in this condition
Cause my flow so sick I shoulda died in the first verse
Mr. Doctor Carter with my hand up a nurse skirt
Suck me like soup and I'mma eat you like surf n' turf
Hah! Just let me know when you comin
And my motherfuckin nigga T. Barker keep drummin
Let's go

I put piss stains on private planes, cause it's my jet nigga
Money ain't shit cause my Rottweilers drink Moët
Diamond baguette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost three nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got a Benz, a Prowler, playboy, and a 'Vette
Tell the truth -- who fucked you on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the N.O. to New York
Who got every bitch's attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking about, look -- y'all dont know?
He fucked that ho
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, it's like 'Harlem World' video
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I don't know
Shorty, when the next time I'mma be up in your bed
I love you? You love me?
Well go 'head on and gimme some head

Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

I told 'Soul' I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing, these hoes doing hella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20-inch chrome
Give me the key, the car, ho, and the alarm
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20-inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the chopper's mine
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Bought it to tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the VC's and TV's so a nigga could shine
Let my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job


I ride the best, from a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a repper
Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moët, and Crissy
See that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring your bitch around me
Cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different
That's your issue
But after she come back
Your best out is not to kiss her
Whole city sayin damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at B.G. watch
That bitch bling-a-ling-a-ling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 G's or better
Me and Wayne take the left
Juve and Baby take the right
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light
Cash Money Millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga Weezy said, we surrounded by ice


Whoa, whoa, whoa
Now I'm shinin' beamin' glossin'
Big Tymin' stuntin' and flossin'
Lamborghini sitting on broaders
With two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari
With Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome
Vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em
I'm back
I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the Hummer
Hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jet's about to land
The women fall out when I let them touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20-inch fans, damn
Goddamn, man, I am
L-I-L, Weezy, off the heezy
But still in awe, ice floodin' on my watch
And in my grill and all
Porshe Box', front blocks
Skrrt! Peeling off, me and Slim in the Rover
Beatrice brick holder, Cash Money young soldier

Dear Summer
Yeah, suffix people, you know, you, you, you already, yeah, come on
Kickin rocks on the block tellin all the old g's
I be coming for your spot when your not looking
Hot cooking momma got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when good grades came through
Then the cooked k's came through
Some soft some stepped on but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights thought I heard
Niggas coming thought I saw the cop lights but
I was dreaming, then I woke, the junkies was still feenin
N I had coke so I had hope u may say that is wrong
But I ain't talkin to ya child I'm talkin to this song
I'm just doing the walk down memory lane
If I crash just pick up my brain
And yes, my nikkas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do then I'm the nikka u blame, so I shoot first anyway
And I would do the honors anyday
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the state like I whip through the A
Show ya ass how to take 4 and get 8
And it don't take 4 nikkas to get straight
The only hot boy even off this plate
Young weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the innerstate
Stop working with that thinner weight
Get ya breaks fixed
Stop playin, cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon be empty
When the stomachs get empty anythings tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kid's sake
Hurricane wipe the south like a earthquake
We tryna save face but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate, we on our way pussies
We eat no cake
Ya'll notice when you see us put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good nikka, think about the hood nikka...
The people who ain't, never had shit, ain't gon neva have shit
Bullshit cause they still gon try to manage nikkas doin anything
Like God gon understand them
But please understand us, nikkas with money lost mansions
Nikkas with nothing lost families
Lives lost in traffic, brought it up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nikka got passion
Even though the bounce back seeming like magic
Shit, but call me sick freak
Watch how I turn one k to a hundred g's
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze
Summer please know I live for ya
Throw on the wifebeater, let back the lid for ya
A few years I prolly hear from ya
But now I'm here for ya
I know nikkas that shed a tear for ya
Behind bars tryna get to ya
They prolly never see ya
It's that real talk if you ever heard it homie
Shit hurt so much might have to hurt ya homie
No commercial no frontin no curve on it
No cut, tell life so what
The drought's in not only white slowed up
The weed slowed up we can't even roll up
Fuck, put it in the money too, but that's the last thing cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what, how we getting on
Where he sittin at, what he sittin on
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world cumin and my city the proof
There, and this is after disaster, this ain't rap dis a recap
Stepping of the g4 still strapped
Bust ya head in the air that's a skycap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollas
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon eat, then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reach
And I'm a get death through these balls, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even, when everything paused, I proceeded
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida, fuck the world not the people, there



Momma gave me the swag, I walk like the President
Talk about only dead presidents and big settlements
Yes I have faith in the flag, yep I'm a citizen
I'm repping for my city that is bad as the city is
Momma ain't teach me no better but to get this cheddar
And that I do and for it I get at you
I consider you all fools, you niggas is hilarious
Young Money bitches don't wanna fuck us, they wanna marry us
Now ain't that some shit
I can't have one bitch but I just got one dick and no
I ain't fucking with the faith
I load my hand gun with hand towels just to touch a nigga face
I am something like a safe, I will never crack
Ain't no combination, nigga never that
If a nigga ever said anything about Weezy and meant it
He gone get it that same evening, Pimpin'
Backseat riding like I'm Mr. Daisy, I am Weezy F Baby, don't miss the Baby
I kiss the lady on her hand, I'm a fly young man, check my wingspan
This year I probably do everything tan by/buy a crib on the sand
Got to float to the land but don't get it twisted I still die for me
And do a bid for my man, keep it real as I can
Cuz I'm strong, strong with a will and a plan
Where there's a will there's a way so make way for the fam
Young Money, I yell it 'til they come for me, come get me
I bet I'll take more than one with me
I know it don't take more than one shot
And for that reason, I'm going to shoot more than one shot
I be clicking when the gun stop, I make the body hot
Then spit on it when the body drop
I get on it like a pot of crack
I get at your bitch, then I tell her like a rapper "holla back!"
I'm still asking, where the dollars at?
I will smash you if you got 'em Jack, I'll peel faster
The lil' bastard in the Maybach
A young nigga, I still think saving is wack
I eat, sleep, shit, and bathe with my gat
I'm like, fuck pimping slaving is back
They like, "Yes Master, You're the best Master"
My hoes need me, I'm like test answers
You don't need me, you might catch cancer
Come back from treatment looking like Van Exel
No, I don't like bald head hoes
I like a long haired diva with the boss ass goals
I'm a all day pleaser, your boy can't go
He too proud, I go where your boy can't go, oh
Nasty ass lil' boy, put my feet up on the dash, pass the the grass
Enjoy, get the coke up off the glass, get the money out the drawers
Get the weed out the jars and we do it like stars!

Haha
Weezy F Baby

You don't wanna be out in the streets
Mouth full of blood, and a soul full of heat
A house full of thugs, and the orders will be like;
"Don't leave 'til you get all of the Ki's"
Head full of holes, and your blood on my sneaks
Like "These is $650, your blood too cheap."

And you better know the Tec live under my seat
Put you in the ground, now you live under my feet
All white diamonds on the front of my teeth
And you better put the O in front of my G
The bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker, don't run it by me
My two best friends will accompany me
And right now they are in my dungarees 'sleep

Hard hat? No, but I got the tool on
And you should be my paper if ever the tool is drawn
Flow retarded, when I spit, I get my drool on
I don't rap, I just shit like a newborn
I don't write, I just spit like a tooth gone
So tell them haters cut it out like a coupon
How come that chopper sound like a nuke bomb?
Little nigga gotta hold that bitch with two arms
I got the heat, the fire, and the lukewarm
I'm on your heels like a shoe horn




The first time I realized I was the best rapper alive
You know what I mean, now before I go into any further in this conversation
Let me let y'all know what I mean about this best rapper alive shit
I don't think I'm better than anybody personally
I don't think I'm better than anybody spiritually
Nahhmean, I don't think I'm better than anybody in any way or form or fashion
But as far as this rap thing, I think I am better than everybody
I'm a competitor, I hope everybody else feels the same way about their craft
You know what I mean, if you do it makes it better for the people
It makes it better for the listeners dawg
And that's how I feel about mine
So, if you're listening and you wanna hear somebody that's dedicated to what they do
I'm so dedicated that I feel I'm the best

See I can understand that
Niggas be saying "Drama, why you talk so much shit on your mixtapes?"
When you're not grinding I'm grinding to get where I'm at
You understand, believe that
And I won't be saying that I'm the best, but I run this

Hah, Dedication 2, that's right, you already...
Wake up motherfuckers it's Weezy, you got a problem?
Heads to them Katrina victims, we still mobbin'
Shiny black coupe at night look like a goblin
AK on the backseat, baby it's so-{*record rewinds*}

Right now, we're gonna hold the fuck up man
See y'all niggas ain't playing close attention right now
Ay Drama, this is what I want you to do man
This is what I really need you to do right now
My nigga Drama, plus he be hitting y'all in the head with that gangster shit
But listen, my nigga Drama man I swear I need you to do
I need you to give me something else for ya now
Just to warm 'em up, and then they gonna...



And I'mma talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'mma talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 because when I talk I spit and
If the haters keep hating, I'mma have to come and talk that shit

Happy ass Weezy, never in a bad mood
Boy I talk shit like I swallowed a bathroom
Girl give me vacuum, do it 'til her lips drool
The ice in your fridge never met a nigga this cool
Young money I’m richer than I used to be
I plant my seed in her garden now she root for me

Call me orthopedic Carter and I ought to be an author
Damn, man and I tell ya, it’d be a best seller
Tim on the beat and me Missy Elliot goes wherever

What up, bruh?
What up?
So, y'know, I was thinkin', right?
Y'know, since we doin' the "He Rap He Sang" album, I figured
Y'know that you from N-O, right?
Mhm, mhm
Right, right, and I'm from Florida
Tallahassee
Right, so I got a couple things to, like, teach you
Okay
That you probably need to know about
Since you came to Miami now
I did
And you know what I'm sayin'
You pretty much a certified Florida boy
Woo!
So is it cool if, like, I just teach you a couple things you need to know?
It's not much, all you gotta do is sit back, relax, take it in, you ready?
No worries, no homo
Alright, let's go

Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Yeah, I like this, a'ight big bruh, fall it out
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
I see you, I think I got this one, I think I got it
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Y'know, I was taught by like, Trick Daddy
And y'know, the real Dunk Ryders
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change

So let's start with the
'72 Chevelle, I know that well
'Cause everybody try to buy that bitch from me
But I will never sell, hell
Mids and highs and 4-12s
24 inches, chopped seats, complete with the Pirells, yeah
Inside got baby blue 'gator scales
Even on the bottom of the seat, you can see the 'gator tail
My shit hard as a turtle shell
Plus I got a mothafuckin' motor that'll make them tires yell
When I was 11, dawg, I learned 'bout my Chevy, dawg
I burned the Pirellis off, convertible, take it off
Believe my leather stayin' soft
That's why I'm at the start line, 'bout to take it off

Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
Mhm, I'ma finish hittin' the weed first
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Oh, but of course, but of course
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
Let me get somethin'

Well, I went and got that new Chevy truck, the one without the little man step
And I love that bitch so much, tomorrow I'ma wear the fan belt
Speakers in the bed sound like I got band help
Beatin' down yo' block, leave you with a damn welt
I used to have a '64 a few years ago
I had that bitch on three wheels on one of my old videos
Now I got a honey SS, I call it Cheerio
But my neighbors call it, "Please turn down the stereo!"
Now cut that hoe up louder
24 karat gold pipes on the low Impala
See Pain, I knew a lil' somethin', but thanks for the lesson
As a matter of fact, y'know what? I'ma buy you a Chevy

Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
See, see Pain I ain't gon' lie, when I got to Florida
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
I haven't saw that many Chevys in my life
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
I meant to say "seen," but um
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
In the spirit of Chevys
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
I'ma switch to T-Wayne and take it back

I said, a long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance, I could make the people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
Oh, but February made me shiver with every paper I deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
But somethin' touched me deep inside the day the music died
So bye-bye Ms. American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys was drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die, day that I die



Let's go - let's go
Let's go - let's go
They can't fuck with me now
Huh? Fuck with me now
No, they can't fuck with me now

And if you wonder who the fuck are them killas with the money nigga

It's like ain't nothin' but 10 hot shellys
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs
Ain't nothin' sweet cause I can't keep trust
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Better hide the kids nigga parents and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Look I'm 'bout to go to see the man in the stars
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your avenue's gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne
Come on!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

Iceberg Shorty dammit, pants is saggin', forty magnum
Comin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'
Ten in the Ferrari wagon, braggin'
Ohh, what's happenin'?
Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the ave with the crack and a 'matic
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to eats on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Weezy Wee - CMB's in my blood
Eagle Street 17's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens
Scrilla, Dough, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the day the man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence

Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it
Niggas be kiddin' - me awake, deal away
Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face

Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score on you like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, knew I looked like a big fool
I must of had the flu, I thought the shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me, what did I do?
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me baby, but you wasn't about me baby
Young Wayne, prepare for change
Because it seems like girlie don't care the same
You had my chain, you beared my name
Then we had champagne

Let's take a toast, to you and me
Let's drink a toast to honor
And the way it's supposed to be

Other people telling me I fell off
Other people telling me I felt y'all
Momma tellin' me I should at least call
My mind tellin' me she should at least call
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seesaw
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seashore
But you got to let her be bored
And when you open up your eyes, I hope you see more
And when I see you, I see detour
Don't need to be depressed anymore
Baby girl, I need more
Now run your mouth until your knees sore

Let's talk it over
Let's talk it over
Let's talk it over now

Five karats on her finger got her hand smitten
But everybody get a ring, even Scottie Pippen
Everybody got a thing but I guess mine isn't, what my vision
So I just sits in my Lamborghini let my top vibe with me
Kick back and get high with me
And if she still get me
I hope my wife know she got a player for life and that's no bullshitin'
I push love to its full limit
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called memory
And I know you in that lane with me
But when the light change, you didn't change with it
And now I'm honkin' my horn
Got to get that dead grass off of my lawn
As I mows on, the champagne's never froze-on
As it pours on the floor




Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Pour it on the models
Shut up bitch, swallow

Shut up bitch, swallow
Shut up bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow

Look, I got one in the back
I got one in the front
I make em' do what I say
They tell me say what I wanna
I tell her, get your money girl and just start breathing
Cuz if it ain't about the dough, it ain't about me neither
See a gangster like myself I get that paper on women
Man yo women probably out there with some paper to give me
Listen, you're looking at a real pimp ask my old women
And they tell you no remote, I control women
I'm a whole load put me in the game woman
If he ain't paying, then he shouldn't be playing
I'm saying, broke dudes only make jokes funny
I make more than I can fit in this quote honey
Unquote comes sun soaked with Me Man
Fly you down here and lay you up in my beach house

Shut up bitch, swallow
Shut up Bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow

Check this out



Yeah
Livin' that life, livin' that life
Under them street lights
But it ain't bright enough to show me where I'm going
But I still find my way, and when I do I keep going, and I'm
A nigga with stripes
Try me and your family don't sleep right
Didn't think I was tough enough to make it on my own
But I could get through anything if I done made it through the storm, and umm
I'm killing that night, killing that night
Life on that East Side
Leather on chrome, television with the phone
And the top is so gone
I do it so right, I do it so right
They want me to be like
I'm in the zone, bad to the bone
Correct me if I'm wrong

Times is hard as it is
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did, Dear Lord

Everyday I've been praying to you
I hope You're hearing everything that I'm saying to You
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money

I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm dying to get over
And once I get over, good Lord I know
That all my drama's over
And I thank you
And I be with them niggas
And ain't none of them broke
They ride around with that rope, and they'll hang you
And leave your mama to cope
On that Holiday note
Damnnnn,Then they put a sign on the do'
Saying you don't know shit
Unless you dying in court, mannnnn
You gotta know how it go
Or else you could end up in another bump in the road
You see


A prisoner of this war
We call America
Where the President is the enemy
And he already won, damn
And Armageddon and depressions already begun
So excuse my expression
But it's my aggression
Cause I'm gonna spread you some
I know my people tired
Of all the crying, all the dying
All the time, we just trying
To get our mind off the crime and find somethin' to find
And did I mention not to mention
That my life is on the line
Give me light, and I'mma shine
Give me rope, and I'mma climb
I'm hoping that the Gates'll be open when I arrive
Until then, I'm alive
My job is to survive
So Lord, keep me in your eyes
I'm tryna say




I see ya, I see ya
Girl I wanna love you long like Eva
I know you want that pita
Girl I say I know you want that pita
That banana like Chiquita
I'ma hit it like Derek Jeter
The neighbor's gon' think I beat her
I'll throw that dick much deeper
Come be my wide receiver
I'll give that girl a seizure
She forget her boyfriend, amnesia
She wanna ride it, I let her have it
She better ride it like Danica Patrick
I get behind it, and move her

I think it's time for us to, time for us to...

Bounce that booty like a basketball
And now she wanna put her sister on
Now I got twins like "The Whisper Song"
And you could call her Mrs. Me Too
I say I'm on a strict diet, I can only eat you
Lick it lick it, lick it, lick it; I like to
I got that Goose in my system
Somebody gon' be my victim
I got patrone in my system

I think it's time for us to, time for us to...


Come free yo' mind, on this dick that I have
You ain't gotta be my wife, but you need dick in yo' life
We gon' fuck all night long, I got kush in my bag
We can blaze one, and when we done
Go back to your man


SIKE!

I think it's time for us to, time for us to...

Shortie's so bright when you look at her make your eyes hurt
Better get a visor
Oh yeah shes cold yeah shes cooler than an iceberg
Fuck what you might heard
You only like her, I'm tryin to wife her

And I said I won't deny her, shorty is a rider
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin like my Bride to be
I take one knee, let me take one knee
And I said, baby will you marry me
We live ever after happily
Just the way that it's supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me



Young Moolah baby!
You know we had to do a remix right?


Hey lil' mama, fuck all that drama

Oh yessir, we gettin' gwap and we poppin'

You niggas wish you could spit it like Vic
Cuz, the whole bay be on my dick

Chorus


Hey lil' mama it's Carter, the boss

Weezy baby bitch I don't mean no harm

She said her name was Lisa Marie
And she was a beast
Woman so bad it's illegal to speak
She say she like me and she was eager to meet
And I was just as eager as eager as she
Body so sick u can eat off her feet
Go to the hospital die in a week
She say she was a model well obviously
Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets
Baby was a flower w/ rose pedal cheeks
And everytime she talk its like a gold medal speech
Intelligent she should teach
And if so
I will be a nerd like screech

I told her I would write a rhyme about her
And it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was Lisa Marie

She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was discreet
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite
I told her we can get away we can retreat
Cut off my arms put um on her seat
Cut off my legs put um on her head
So I could run thru her mind like she does mine
And everytime she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket on the candy isle
I saw a picture of her w/ her panties down
I fall asleep and dream I'm a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower
Or one of her bath towels

I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was lisa marie

She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was a piece
A piece of fine art like a piece of the leak
She was unique ex-quisite
Like x y z she was complete
And I think she like butterflies
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summer time
Birthday the same month as mine w/ a different sign
Virgo I go wherever her go
If she say so I'm on her like a fur coat
In November she colder than December
She got me fallin' like TIMBER!

I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track she said that's deep
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat

This is the beat this is this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was Lisa Marie



No one on the corner have swagger like I
Too cool for school, fly boy high
I drop out like I fell, from the sky
Hold up, let me wipe the cloud off my eye
He has class, first in the lunch line
My lunch ticket let my eat rappers at lunch time
Swagger, shinin' brighter than sunshine
Misfit, duck in the fashion one time
No one on the corner has swagga like moi, Church
But I'm too clean for the choire
I require what I desire I earn my stripes, Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas
Run up in your house just me; no mas
Runnin this bitch like I got four thighs
No one like swagger like these four guys!



Lite it up
Shots Leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga

Shots Leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga


I can’t fuck with ho niggas
I can’t trust these hoes neither
Wake up early in the morning
Eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hater ass niggas be baller blocking
Acting like some goalkeepers
There’s a reason for everything
But my niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with a ho beater
All-black hoodie, I’m Grim Reaper
Look like its time for spring cleaning
Brand new spanking street-sweeper
Been in the game, I’m knee-deep
I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready
To set it off, Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum
Split swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump
Double barrel on that pump
This Kush I got ain’t no chump
Get stupid and get stomped
Two guns I call ‘em Kriss Kross
Kriss Kross will make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do
Got goons, I ain’t even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool
I like my bitches in two’s
Gotta go, I stick it and move
G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high
I swear to God, I went to the moon
I’m on that shit you can’t get nowhere
You pussy boy, don’t go there
If I don’t do nothing I’mma ball, no hair
Smoking on that “oh yeah”
My niggas tote that hardware
What you ’bout woadie?
My niggas about that warfare
Real nigga since day one
Cause I ain’t promised day two
Throw that pussy at me
Bitch I think I’m Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way
Yeah that’s that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle
I’m gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty cake
Blood gang, red bandanna face
Make them pussies pop they-self
You can call that “masturbate”
I don’t front no fabricate
I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F Baby bitch, the F is for Fascinate
Louisiana, I’m from that swamp
I’mma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump
Fuck you and where you from
3, 2, I am the one, job well done
I ball 24/7, 365, 12 months
Wassup redbone? Wassup caramel?
Come to Wayne’s World, it’s a fairy tale
Yeah I’m high bitch, bitch I para-sail

Lite it up

I am living the game, hitting the fades, quick cash
Blink too fast you'll be gone, no quicksand
This man ain't givin a fuck for no middle man, middle class
Skipped class only class I knew, was S-Benz
Now pretend you never heard of me from a can of candy yams
And I was just a boy like killer cam
But now my print over yo bitch, T-shirt
Glass skirt, research his work, iPhone Blackberry chirp
But it gets worse, how would you feel
Fresh of work, seeing this light-skinned jerk
After I'm all working your girlfriend purse
Damn ma, didn't he fuck friend ha?
Yea why? I thought that goofy bitch was lying
Guess not, bet not they won't near us
Fear us, Y.M squadron
Young bloods
Nothing above eyebrows, G.E.D forever above
Studio, many yums, I ain't fucking with the club
While you getting bub, I'm getting pub
These songs I mean, these songs be mean
Got your label warring, Cause I'm making quality quantities
I got the holy spirit, but no father son

Now everybody know I'm shinning in the coupe, No roof while I'm shitting on em
Rolling through the eastside, Hollandwood is hitting for
I'm all about my hustle, need my chips so I could stack it up
Gone on the pill got me rolling like a acura
Young money nigga, Yea I'm back like I left something
You niggas is jaw jacking, watch me sidestep son
Young nigga, got my money running like Barry
Bitches want my baby cause they heard about my salary
Make them dog hoes lay it down like balling g
Knock them bitches socks loose, pass em off to Mallie G
All brown maybach, you could say I'm yoohoo'n
All my niggas red flagging you could see we soo woo'n

And numbers don't lie, lieeeeee

Okay I'm on my way, speedin windows up
So have my food warm, and have my pillows fluff
She been through the water, shawty guerilla tough
Shawty take all them shots like the Louis cup
I wanna give her all, and never give her up
I told her when it died down we could live it up
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...


Yeah, I'm like
As soon as I come home, I was workin long
She wanna know what I was working on
So I play her this song
And I make her feel wrong
But still in all in my eyesight, she passed right
I can't trip cuz no one loves the fast life
Or sittin in the passenger seat, hold tight
When she gives a whole platter to me, her whole life
But for me that's too much to eat, in one bite but
I'mma chew and just do what I gotta
Other bitches get the boot like a high top Prada
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...


Can I talk to her, yeah, um
Leave the drama on daytime television
What is this detention?
It feel like elementary
I wish I never injure
Hurt or scar you
When I think of my future
Baby that are you
I mean that is you
Part of my fears
You know, part of my mental
See what I'm into?
See how I'm in too deep in the shit too?
It ain't just you, it is us two
I trust you, you gotta trust me
Cuz in them other bitches eyes I'm a must-see
Now where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me girl

It's killin me
Wooooo
I must like it when you question me about it baby
I swear, but they say, it's just not true



What is this!
I can't feel my fucking face!
Ohhhhhhh!

Louisiana live wire, New Orleans nightmare
Got these niggas scared, they growin' white hair
I'm from the swamp lil mud on my Nike airs
Stomp in your face lil blood on my Nike airs
Stomp in your face till your face says Nike air
I'm with my pack and we attack like bears
And we can go anywhere like air
Motherfuckin' temper shiftin like bike gears
Head high, I got the world on my back they told me I can turn around, but never look down
They told me if I shoot the AK I better aim down
They say even a train collision produces the same sound
I said, wow!
And I went and got two two
So you better be listenin' for that choo choo
Soowoo!

I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on

My guns touch kids like pedafilers
I stretch your mouth I'm the excersizor
Gun in his mouth like a breathalizer
Swallow lead saliva, you ain't straight I'mma 12 o'clock ya
Niggas pour cement on your body and cinder block ya
But I really think they shocked at how clear my rocks are
I'm on that rah rah, uh huh, they sweet like peach, cobla
My bills gotta be paid, my kid gotta get fed
So if a nigga gotta lay down I'm making his bed
Medium rare I hope he like his meat red, braaap!
They scramble niggas hope you eat eggs
Onefiftyfirst bitch!

I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on

They say God protect fools and babies
I'm a G, so I depend on my tool for safety
I roll on niggas like skate key
Skate broads, Tony Hawk on a skateboard
Who fucking with me?
With arm on the wheel, with arm on the steel
Could it be I'm crazy, Gnarls Barkley forreal
You play dumb and you lay numb

The world is so happy and my gun is too
So how I can take a life when it's dark in the room
When that means it's nighttime so I talk to the moon
And it tells me that I'm flier than the stars on a broom
And I don't care what niggas say nor what bitches said
We like green all got a different bread
Push my eraser and I will give you lead

I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on



Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Uhm Uhm Uhm

Throw them somethin to wipe out ya hold shit

Head stomachs and hips

But a lot ain't enough, so I got an occupation
Gotta bring the bacon, straight to the kitchen table
Homie if ya girl pregnant, you should kiss her naval
Cuz you probably won't live, To see the motherfuckin cradle
Your past left a scar, and your future's lookin' fatal
You can't be sorry, You gotta be a savior
Gotta be the bread winner, so go rob the bread maker
When they put ya homey to sleep, it's gotta be a wake up
You move in the hood, then ya gotta meet the neighbors, damn

The killas is ballin, the niggas is targets
The snitches is talkin, but this is New Orleans

I already know how to piss in the toilet, I'm tryin to get the pot
To piss in in the mornin'

Sitting on my porch, sippin’ on Jim Beam
Read the newspaper, man, guess what I seen
Shit bad enough to make a grown man scream
And then I woke up, it's not a bad dream
Eh, I don’t really wanna talk about it
Cause every time I talk about it, I go off about it
And every time I get like that, I wanna start somebody
This world really got you thinking that you on somebody
So what, you got a gun, I don’t give a fuck about it
I would take every bullet and every buck up out it
So, motherfucker, cock it back and please buck away
Cause right now I’m feeling fuck you

And fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

I say fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

Don’t you see that this whole world is my stage
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but we don’t care what they say
I'ma take this shit day by day

Man, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning
And my tank on E, plus the gas prices soaring
Baby momma trippin', tryna get me for my money
Now she laughing to the bank and ain't a damn thing funny
My momma lights off and my daddy don’t call
And my nigga got killed, man damn, I miss my dawg
The landlord buggin' and the rent keep coming
And the heater broke, I gotta warm my house with the oven
Every time I think about it, man, it get depressing
And the stock market down, the whole country in recession
Plus the cops got a warrant out, they trying to arrest me
Man, this whole day startin' to stress me, nigga so

Fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be a'ight, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

So fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be a'ight, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

Don’t you see that this whole world is my stage
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but I don’t care what they say
I'ma take this shit day by day

Okay, these are the days, the days of our lives
Well, do you have a calender because I lost mine
Uh, I lost mine, uh, I lost mine
I’m the sickest virus on and offline
Imaginary line, you don’t wanna cross mine
Found a clock in the street, I’m making up for lost time
Third eye blind but it’s still fuck the bullshit
Knowing what I got but more conscience of what I could get
Tired of the same shit, don’t know who to blame, shit
And we knew a black President wouldn’t change shit
Money still a language, well ain't nobody talkin’
They found my calendar in the garbage, so

Fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

I say fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay

Have your people like "Where the hell you went?"
They find your ass with everything but movement
And money talks and I speak it fluent
And I keep a tool so don't be screwin'
Around uptown, in this bitch like "Oh, wait"
Young Money on the grind, no off-days
Young Money got cheese like Hog Head

Same bad bitch that you boys can't get

And they wonder why I sing and changed all my outfits
'Cause all y'all rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit

Second Line, Second Life tambourines in the sky

Lemme fix my hat
Hol' up, lemme fix my hat

The streets make the hustlas
Hustlas make the world go round
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you can't knock the hustle
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen
And my J butter put more 'd' on me
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
.45 mack with the flash on that
Who want it
Everybody sing along

Now I'mma ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline
And I'mma shine cuz I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough cuz I got hustle in my bloodline
I bleed concrete

And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by La Costra Nostra said
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here


I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips
The kid is a nuisance
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the Blueprint
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit
Like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez




Hello Motherfucka, Hey hi how you doing
Its Weezy F. Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches
Pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, Half to the rizzle

Let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain’t met a nigga like me

Ryders rolling with me like eleven wheels

Kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us
But we ain’t even tripping

Punch a king vision

Fuck how I did them
Watch how I'm about to do them
I'mma drag him from the river
Dump his body in the lake
Let the bullets from the K throw a party in your face
Yeah, DJ Extra Clip, so go DJ!
I will kill you on your B-Day
Have a bitch with twin Glocks
Jump out your cake
Tell her merk em, and don’t forget about the safe'
We ain’t even walking, we runnin this shit
Like a toilet in a bank I want my money and shit
And I call cocaine my Columbian bitch
And my Columbian bitch like my Columbian ditch
Get it? got it? good I'm gone
Boy where you going?
You know where i’m going...


My style, My style, is second to none
So you got to put me on
Like Bonita Applebum
A Tribe Called Quest
A guy called the best
Never lie for less
Cause I stand for more
Young Me
I get it in, yes
I get to the inns like I-N-N
And y'all suite like hotels
And you may be fly but I propel
High Profile, gun no smile
Warn your child, warn your spouse
And I would keep going in but the song's going out
Peace



SB dunks, five seven five jeans

Wait, shit gets way more crazier
We flip the bitch like she was in the gymnasium

Somethin' like my Benzo, Ridin' with my friend's hoes

Come to the beach and find
I live where all the little seagulls fly
See, baby, I'm so high
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride

Me an' Mac is just two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the young lion and he the young bull
Not Sammy the Bull, that pistol on my hip, now I gotta hand in the pool
I had a Lammy in school
I think it was diablo red
I'm t-i-red, I'm T.I red
You D.I-ed because of what you said
Chyee, I'm sharp as an image
And I keep it bumpin' like a mothafuckin' blemish
Two twins drink me up like Guinness
When I'm finished, I say, "Billion"
When I'm finished they say, "Weezy, you killed it"
Hop on your shit and say, "Weezy, you healed it"
So fly I got wings tattooed on me
A gun glued on me, but I pop ya in ya stomach
Now I got yesterday's food on me
Now that was real rude, homie
And I smell like a weed plant
Young Money mothafucka, where that cheese at?



Ohh, this feel good, alright, Ye
Carter Trey, on it, let's play, haha

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Okay, put your hands up if you did it before
Now your girl lookin' at you cause she didn't hell know
And now everybody sayin' that you did it before
And you know that's because they probably did it before
Cause if they did it before it would be different though
I wonder if Tammy knows, that I did it before
With Nisa, I wonder if she didn't hell know
That we did it before I know they did it before
The day we did it but oh, if they did it before
And we did it before, we can get it fa' sho
Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa' sho
I'm a tear that pussy up, like I didn't before
And after I did it they be history though
When I see em I act like I didn't hell know
That we did it before like we didn't before
But we did it before, hehe

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Yeah, so if you did it before, be a pro
You gotta act like you didn't before
And everytime I meet a girl
They say that she didn't before
You know I gotta act like I never did it before
But she would be dumb if she didn't hell know
Cause I did it before and she will be dumb
If she think that I didn't, hell know
That she did it before, she probablly didn't go low
So we did it some more and we did it some more
Like Busta Rhymes said, she holla "give me some more"
So we did it some more, yeah, we did it til' four
And when four-o-one came, she was hittin the door
Not fixin' to go but she was hittin' the door
And I was probably butt naked just twistin' an O
Then I call my homies up, kick the shit how it go
And I know they gon' laugh cause they did it before

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Okay, a lot of folks don't like to say they did it before
Wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
That they did it before, like if they did it'd be low
Or if they did it with more, than one, or did it for dough
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
How come you ain't with it now, but you was with it before
Oh, that's your best friend, yeah, ya'll kick it I know
Ya'll probablly did it before, she probably licked it before
Like it was liquid before, yeah, I can vision you both
Like I done did it before cause I done did it before

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Is Mack Maine a fortune teller?
Because he predicted Miley would
Be ready for the world years ago


I saw some shit recently with her

She must be on that other one

Pop it off
Pop it off

A molly

Y'heard me!

Eureeekaaaa

You don't know which one I'm talking 'bout though

So, Is Mack Maine a fortune teller?

I don't know, If he is I'm gon' get some cookies



I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number
After how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
Nigga please


I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good...I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life...the picture flipped
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody


You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggas love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back

Young Weez'got the young'n blues y'all





I got money on the drank
And half on the dank

Yeah, thank god I'm a millionaire
Hard body, these other boys teddy bears
Fuck with me momma, I know you want a G
And I'm a real blood, if you want R&B
Just call me Carter honey, if you can't say the baby
Bitch I'm so fuckin' hot, I feel radiated
Ho I'm so fuckin' fly, my eyes are aviaters
I'm stuck at the top floor in the elevater
Cause I'm high, dumb high
Nigga, I could look into the sun's eyes
Young guy, but rich though
And I keep a rag on me like a 64, like a 64
You know I got that bounce
It's mister-quick-to-pour-a-eighth into a 20 ounce
Okay I'm Terminater, you niggas Minnie Mouse
And I'm Young Money, anyhow

Chorus Repeat 9X

It's hood shit baby, so you know it's all thug's
Rockstar life, lotta sex and alot a drug's
It's OG Kush, purple dro and kind bud
Have a real nigga feelin' like he's so fucked up
Have a fake nigga feelin' like he's so bucked up
There go the weed man, spitta back the truck up
There go the lean man, thugga we done lucked up
I mix the two dro by my bitch and then we rough fuck
I leave a Crego to the lot and pick a Jag' up
If you was in my shoes, nigga you could brag cuz
Weezy Wee got me, Baby he got me
Young Money, Cash Money, bitch that's my posse
Million dollar man Ted DiBiase
Now let me tell you, if I'm missin' a bush
Shit'll get ugly than New York from the Flavor Of Love

Chorus Repeat 9X




I've been standin' here waitin', Mr. Postman
So-o-o patiently
For just a card, or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning home to me, Mr. Postman

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's right darling, aha
Yeah, It's ya baby, baby, ha

I got her waitin' on me, she lookin' down the block
She see me walkin' up and she run to the mailbox
She say it feels she's up in a cell block
Just come to make my mail drop, more masculine than him
I'm nastier than him, I'm passin' her and him
In something faster than them
And she correct him, and I respect her
And he protect her, and she neglect him
And he caress her, and she molest me
And when her man home, I'm the ghostman
Why you think she holdin that pillow close, man?
Why you think she won't open the bathroom door?


Girlfriend snatcher, I don't care if you're attached
If that's her, then that's her
And that's me to smash her
Hehe, yeah baby I got that comeback
I'm at your walls like a thumbtack
So Miss Humpback, I know what to do with all that
That's big talk for a little guy
But I'm walkin' without reply
She got her legs up, she tryin' to walk in the sky
I'm like, "Yeah baby, I'm right here baby
He's here baby!" She like, "Yeah baby!"
Heres a chain letter and some magazines


Yeah, she love my gangsta, she feel my swagger
I'm there every week just to give her her package
I pick up her bills and I pick up her taxes
She want young holly grove in a envelope
I'm her private note and you ain't gotta know
I'm her fantasy, she always got letters on the canopy
No postal service, I just got my social workin'
And your girl is lurkin', and this world is dirty
And your girl is nervous, to give me head in the convertible
Yeah, kind and curtious, she love that in me
She love me in her, and I love that plenty
It never fails, sorry homeboy




Got a early call from Kisha, Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gon' beep ya
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
Cuz she wanted me to see her, said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Cristal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater, left Nae-Nae with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause I heard she was a freak but
They say she keep it cleaned up, but I don't want HIV bruh
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
It up like some peanuts
I said "oooohhhh Kisha"
Chopped off like a millimeter
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro, oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go you to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya

Now I'm hot, I wonder what's up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call, see if it's alright
For me to dip through, she said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me peepin at him, but he didn't open his mouth
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass ho
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut, now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got studio tonight, me and da H B'eezeys
I can't be late, I'm gon' see ya when I could
Hit Juve on the hip, let him know it was all good

Ooohh Oooh there she go, on the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know, we done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed, she told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car all smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and mouth and I said fuck it
Hey ho, I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.Geezy on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good up in the alley
Not the telly

This ho don't know I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk, I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on the balls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do a nigga, should be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that ho won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that ho might just fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head, end up doing somethin bad ha
Kisha got did right yeah
Fucked the whole Cash Money click all in one night yeah

IZI IZI IZI

Me-di Me’, c’est mon DJ
Pour entrer dans ma soirée
Tenue correcte et flingue exigés

Aiguisé est le coup d’genou
Le couteau plein d’sang
Je les ai vus comme David Vincent
Les ai tués comme Chaka Zulu

Rien à foutre passe moi les menottes, j’suis MC à métaux !
Depuis la nuit des temps c’est très très dur d’être un négro !
Mes jambes viennent de Thaïlande, ma queue vient de Tchernobyl
Mon cœur vient d’Afrique, ma force vient d’Obi Wan Kenobi

Tu ferais klawi, mon brakmar est à l’affiche
On pourra pas s’entendre, comme entre sunnites et salafistes
Mon flow est au caviar, le leur est à la pisse
Tu m’cherches, j’suis à la que-ban, dans une chatte ou à la gym


Get money fuck bitches
Fuck bitches get money
Fuck bitches get money


Yeah
Nigga get it in a slump if you know how
In the heart of the summer we need a snow plow
What you know bout that baby its yo time
Coke transactions on the phone we call it blowjob
Too fast for the feds too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch gettin sloppy wit the pots
Hoppin off the boat meetin papi at the docks
He tell me I'm gainin weight I tell him I'm gettin paid
Money over bitches I'm yellin it to the grave
Developed at a young age go after what pays
These Gabana sunshades block the sunrays
I drop a car note in the mall on the first day
I gotta get it even if its in the worst way
That cake like it's it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace ya heard me
Where moneys more important than the person
Nigga



Twistin up a blunt thinkin bout my next dollar
I'm diggin in the game tryna get some money out her
I'm so vain its a problem
It ain't a stain on these Pradas I'm just bein modest
Got me a goddess sure how to divide it
She still down and she don't get none of the profit
We around the city let the tints hide me
Thats a cold muhfucker whoever inside it
Forever symbolizing the grind it don't walk to you
I make it run like horses do
Giddy up baby if you got it then hit 'em up baby
I know its crazy but I can't get enough baby
I love it I fuckin love it
I'm a self made millionaire fuck the public
Ridin to myself cause I don't fuck with nothin
Pistol on my lap on the way to the money

Okay, I'm Weezy, baby
And, I am from the south where we call our women 'Baby'
Hey, baby, hey, baby, all day I smoke, hey, hey, hey
I'm balling like fadeaway, three letter credit, AOK
Black car, black car, girl, I've got a black car
Can I buy some of your time and charge it to my black card
You can be my bitter sweet, shake that sugar and salt
Chain's full of asphalt, bullshit walks, cash talks
Car black, car big, car fast, Car- ter
Can I stick my pencil in your sharpner
Beat it up like it's a drum, call me Travis Barker
Tat, tat, tat, boom, boom, tat, tat, boom, boom, tat, tat

All I really want is for you to back it up
Go and back it up, back it up, put your weight on it
Because it's alright, do what you want to, make me believe you
Get it, shorty because it's the remix, baby, the remix, baby, the remix
So get, get, get it, shorty because it's the remix, baby

I'mma Show you How To Get These Ho's
Fully Clothed Or The Shoe Models

Tight Calf Muscles Manicured Toes
French Tips for The French Kiss On
The French Riviera
Ever Been There , Neva
Well I'm internationally known
And excepted Gone Get Naked
No I Respect it So I'mma exit
Sand in an Hourglass Gone By The Second
I'mma Get Shawty Like Danny Devit-o
Hit A Party Get It Started Shall We
Go smoke Past The velvet rope
Hopin Later On That She Gets Her Pelvis Broke
Say Ichi Ni San Shi, He Say We Say Ding Dong Pssh


Go get his card and hit the mall
And buy whatever that you want and
He keep calling, keep ignoring
I'mma pick You Up and We Goin Bounce Like Spalding
Tight up balling Chicks like tila
Sidekicks * pics looking like vida
Pull Into the Max Just Look At my meter
Fallin' in love the minute I meet her
Groupies be trying to act like they divas
Till I eject them outta my beamer
Step to the side its lookin Like We The Same As A Sumo With a wife beater
Super tight koopa's right
Put a little player-ism In Your life
Cause I'm the type of grinch that you like
My money mean and ain't too polite
To play or to dance?
Naw, baby stop it
The right time to do it
See the top as it's poppin'
See the door when it's lockin'
Jaws will drop cause they watchin'
Candy Paint changing Huey's
Call it pop, lock, and drop it




Young Mula Baby
Money on my mind
He ain't even thank
He didn't even see me with the pistol in the shade
Walked up to him put the pistol to his tank
Pussy nigga faint
Pick that pussy up
Naw let him lay

Hammer in the draws
Hammer in drawers
And ya'll ain't nothin but nails in the wall
Posters, holsters
Empty like a muthafucka
Off my hip, clip empty like a muthfucka
Hehe, ok simply I'm a bug- lover
It's fly carter, duckin the fly swatter
Simply, I'm a muhfucka
Pimpin' ain't dead, because I'm pimpin like a muhfucka

Now where ya ho at?
Wipe ya feet on the door mat
I'm a bring in, no back
Like em to go with no back
I'm a-go forward, the top can get lower, them hoes 'gon get cut
Like a sword, I know it
You ain't gotta tell me
I already smell it
You pussy niggas eatin' peanut butter and jellys
Ya los' like angeles
But you can find me in the white tan Ellis
Just like Van Halen
I'm a rock out bitch
I'm a wear that Glock like a fucking outfit
I don't care what you know
You ain't no nothin' 'bout this
And I hope your ass choke when you suck my dick

Ok, I’m strapped up
Im strapped up, downtown many acts straight jackets ain’t strapped up
And scrappin we could do, see scrappin what we do
And I’m like let me at em! Call me Scrappy Doo
Hazardous to scrap with you I ain't lookin stupid
You beat me? Too bad, bitch, I’m comin back shootin!
Fool I’m a fool, I do what I do
It’s like fixing broke cars, which tools i'mma use?
Tha Tech or the Uz, the Mac or the Rug
Catch you when it’s just you, You’re like “it wasn’t just you!”
I guess i’m just to real for niggas to adjust to
Fuck me? Naw bend over nigga, fuck you
See I know what’s what, who’s who, and who is you
Move you lose you move an inch and more ligaments that you could lose
I’ll put you on the 10 O'clock news
One, two, buckle ya shoes
Here come the Kid who
Ooo gloves Uz will fill up your old wounds
Dudes using more tools than Tim from Home Improve
Then I play it cool, smooth as James Brown shoes
Don’t play with him cuz shoot he’ll shoot
I’m loose as a goose on that goose with them hoes
I’m playin duck duck goose, boy I’m slick like mouse
I’m tha truth not a fluke I’m a murderer, Fuck you!
Put niggas on mute like



Microphone check, I still don't hear my...
Oh yeah I do, yeah I do
Who the fuck is Stevie J?

Don't be lookin' for no donations
You get dick, then reservations
I get pussy then hibernation
I start humpin' soon as I wake up
I woke up in some new punani
He woke up bleedin' like "who shot me?"
I kept shootin' Boo said "you got 'em"
Now all we gotta do is get rid of the body
But anyway I woke up in some new punani

I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk he can fit
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candles lit
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Got some shit built up I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
The TEK on my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Hold up, all bullshit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
Pussy feel like vacation
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'
Give her to Fuke, if she caucasion
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
I used to be at them Heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Don't stop, pop that don't stop
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi

Sippin' on dumb, puffin' a J
Met her tonight, fuck her today
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face
Wine head, she's guzzling grapes
Back shots, I'm holding her waist
Freaky, I always freak...
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her
Hating niggas be hungry
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em
Her panties are down, her legs is up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes
No flowers, were sent, but we fucked in the Rolls
No flowers, were sent, but we fucked in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they mad, I told they was
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She's suckin' me off, I'm pokin' her brain
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing
That pussy so wet, I'm calling it rain
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
Most women front, but who do you blame?
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy
It's safe to say it's an even exchange... bitch!

Don't be givin' out information
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expectations
You know this is the Dedication
I'm on that kush she on that molly
I turn that pussy to Dasani
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi
I don't know this ho
So I must dash, no disguises
Tunechi, I had to Dedication 5 it



Look look look - don't play with me
Look look look
Huh? Huh? Look

Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust bang!
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Weezy Wee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'mma hit the block and barrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'mma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run

Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'mma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen Creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you war with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!


You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'mma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'mma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?


Niggas bet' not play with me
Look look look
Look look look
Whoa



This the remix baby, yea!
You already know what it is
Cause if you don't, you just don't know nothing
Shit period... stupid

You know me, I just be chillin in the phantom, listenin to opera
Gun is my body guard, call it Kevin Costner
Probably won't stop if, I get to poppin them shots
You niggas is sweeter than a box of Red Hots
Fuck around, see a flock of red dots
Smoke good, eat good, only fuck a bitch
If her dough good, feet good, just bought a fleetwood
And I'mma put some D's on that bitch
Lookin like I got a diamond disease on my wrist
Fresh! bunch of little G's on my kicks
I'ma dog, your all a bunch of fleas on my dick
Young Money Cash Money, and we gon' get the money even if it kills ya'll
And I'mma ride, 'til the muthafuckin wheels off
George Gervin, I'mma get my chill on
I'm cold, yeah I get my Buffalo Bill on
Beatin up ya block, yeah I get my Emmitt Till on
In the New Edition, yeah I get my Johnny Gill on
Keep a shotgun, yeah I get my Jason Will on
Fuck it Swizz, I'm still gon'
Black entertainment, yeah I get my Steven Hill On
Only to talk models, yeah I get my Seal on
Make that chick rock, get my Emil on
Two girls, let 'em get they pill on
Let 'em get they feel on, I get my Tip Drill on
Hey, now why you that ice grill on?
I leave you lookin like you got a barbeque grill on
Yeah, we got money to the ceiling
Real nigga, I get my Keep It Real on
And they be lying on wax, like a earphone
Weezy Baby, the best from here on
Swish, I'm in gear homes
They in trouble, we gon' bubble like beer foam
No homo, let em get they queer on
No commercial, I just take the leer home
My girl she get her pampoir on
She don't touch me, I got cashmere on

Weezy the Beast, Swizzy the Monster and we're gone

That P on my hat is for piru
That P on my hat is for piru
That P on my hat is for piru

Just a third ward gangsta, been filthy , top ranker
Hustler, shot caller
Kill 'em all, keep banking
Big mansions on the island
Popping shots out the bottle
Spending cause we’re winning
Five star, money, and power!
Built on some solid shit, bad bitch born rich
Turn water into wine, hit your set and paint that bitch
O-O-Out the Bentley with them doves, stashes for the plug
Green and red bottom, throwing hundreds in the club
Bossing on the shine, we the niggas running shit
Blood to blood-line, pearl white black tints
Head light, red light, spend them at the green light
Flash light, fast life, hit 'em for a cheap price
Uptown swagger life, living like we live it twice

Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go “pu”
Got a mean ass swagga, my bitches do too

Fuck with me baby, it’s Tunechi baby
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I’m rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch I’m king kong
I eat her ice cream... Pop a pill and pop that pussy
I bet you tunechi make her throw away that silver bullet
And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest
And then she… eat my ice cream cone...

Reputation for Gs; thats the role of a boss
So amazing to see, black baguettes in my watch
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop
But its nothing to me, that extends from my block
I got a lot of figures, I’m a father figure
She know a lot of niggas, don’t know a hotter nigga
Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I’m here to nurture, I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermes and barely scratch the surface
She know on purpose, as I peel the curtains
I always make her nervous, this record’s perfect

And it's .. party time excellent waynes world
Party time excellent Waynes world
Tonight im probably fucking another niggas girl
Party time excellent Waynes world

But I'm laid back, back of the club
Tuss in the cup, tuss in the blunt
Gun in the gut, stunt if you want
Play if you may, try if you like to fly
I put wings on you, and shoot you out the sky
Niggas scared of money, see the chrome outside
Do the homicide, we got the chromers out
Known to ride bonafide on the rise
That corner mine, Eagle street all the time
And bitch niggas don't apply
Naw player call yourself a tiremark
Make a nigga drive way up the sidewalk
Your people paint the concrete red
Harder head make a soft-ass, my father said
I made it past twenty, I'm an old man
A dead man walking, kill me if you can
Damn, but you the president man
Well I guess I'm a dead president man
Yeah I'm just money, baby trust me
Bet on me, go with me
Man the chance is looking chubby
And we dancing on your grave when you dead boy
2-step, juke juke, I'm a made boy
I'm a made boy, no I'm a made man
I give 'em heead nods, I don't shake hands
Don't take it personal, its part of my position
I feel all police is pussies, baby send me my petition
Yeah that's what I said, an double fuck the FED's
Now what's trouble to a troubled child?
Nothing. what's murder to a murderer?
A thing. get it? it ain't nothing but a thing
Everybody got to lose this, ain't nothing but the game
Yeah an this ain't nothing but them real verses
And if you listening to this, then you a a real person
I got kicked but I'm still lurking, still searching
Got a fetish for desert, squirt like the middle of a jelly doughnut
Off my back wit my pump make his belly gross up
I'm right handed, his right side swoll up
No homo, but my dick couldn't fill his hole up
Niggas hold up, tell them niggas wait
Man get off my dick, nigga just ask your bitch
Niggas hold up tell them bitches wait
The best rapper alive, yeah now what you say?

But since I'm the President

Cause that's how many nurses I got workin'
On my dizzick
Snakes in the grass
Rats, lizards
But 'round here snitches don't exist
Like wizards
Ho, this ain't punch
I'm sippin' on some sizzurp
I roll a fat joint
And do my fingers like scissors
The game so cold
I done had my share of blizzards
But now I got that big money
Runnin' like rivers
Nigga
I'm here to get my shit straight
Burner on the hip-waist
Leave a nigga's street full of bones
Like a fish plate
Yea, I'm from the hood
But now I'm living in a rich way
Swear I got on my knees
And thanked God for this day
So say what you wanna say
I need to throw a cup of water in my face
First place
I –

Nigga talkin beef shit? Boy-boys likes Oprah
DJ Magic Mike got that bass, I done told you





Alot of niggas better move out
Cause here I come with my click
With the tools out
All of a sudden all these cowards
Startin to spook out
It's warfare a buncha of niggas
Bout to lose out
It's time to load up them thangs
Hit the spot run in his house
And make 'em show up then thangs
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets
And then blow up his brains
No matter the weather
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail
I'mma slangin' that metal
So tell 'em niggas in yo' hood
To get it together
Cause I'm with tola, mario
And we down for whatever
Never underestimate or you goin under, see
Y'all can keep playin with Lil Wayne
But that lil' boy trouble
And plus dis shorty be full, wodie
Be scorin bundles, then start wildin'
Hit the block and let his toys rumble
And it go ratter-tatter
Ya be suprised how niggas scatter
When the M-1 shatter
And everybody on the block
They get bout' ten in they bladder

Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your lifes gone
We done left the block quiet

Look, look
When it's time to ride
It ain't no time to play
It could be time to die
At any time of the day
And i'll be godammit
If I let a nigga steel me
It will not happen
Ima fire about a hundred and fifty shots at 'em
And got my Glocks rammin'
Leave a nigga spot damaged
That's how the beat made us
I chief three blunts
So I can get a head rush
Then come around the corner
And your whole day crush
I'm sick and tired
Niggas choose to test the water
They get hit and die
Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partners get lit up
And then they ask why?
That's cause you played wit' me
They could'nt of known im'a guerilla
Drama stayed with me
Ran in his home went to kill him
Took his head with me
You better get it right or keep it right
Or lose your whole town
Tell em' lights off
It's about to go down


Massacre all these streets; block it off
Lil Wayne is in yo hood
With something like a rocket dog
And I'm after ya
I don't pass beef
I stop at all
That boy got a head on his shoulders
I knock it off
I'm highly intoxicated mixing krystelle and vodka
Somebody call the doctor
Cause my chopper done went blocka, knocka
Nigga out the way man
I'm sorry but us guerillas we can't stay tamed, say it man
Are you ready, ready
Ready for warfare Wayne, Turk, Juve, and BGeezy they all there
We all flare, don't care, dog they all tear
Give the guns to the one with the long hair
Dem block burner
It gets quiet they see the rims twenty four seventy
Bullets they come steadily
You better stay off the block
Cause you might fall
You better stay off the block
Cause the lights off


Lights off
Tell em' lights off
La, la, la lights off
Nigga lights off
We done left the block quiet

Aye, I do it way bigger than you did it

Homeboy, you trippin' you gon' fall and bust
Yo' ass - I could rap fast but I like slower better

One window to let the dawn in
Cuz we hustle in this bitch midnight to morning, yea

You on the backyard lawn where a nigga got the ganja growin'
No cats or dogs, rats or snakes, Sams or Jakes

Fuck you, yo' mama, yo' daddy and where you lay at
What's beef, beef is when you fuck with us
Guaranteed to leave yo' ass up under the bus
There's no one quicker, than a hot boy nigga
That'll get you with the knife, or pow with the trigger
There's no one keaner, with the chrome Sarafina
Murder ain't nuttin' but a misdemeanor


Fo' sho' nigga

They ask who I'm fucking I say 'whoever wanna know'
And I can fuck whoever I like

Got my two fingers out the roof see me repping out
The Levi's is skinny so I'm walking with the weapon out
Two bitches on my arm get my don won on
Watch the ho's go crazy when the boy's song on
Multicolored stones on, we getting money, yeah
I get my Styrofoam on, my cup muddy
Yeah I walk down on ya bitch, then I run away with her
Let her do what she like, then I have my way with her
I ain't trying to play with her, I ain't trying to stay with her
I'm just trying to dick her down nigga you can lay with her
So give me MySpace like dot com
I'm Funk Master Flex with the flow I drop bombs
Young Gudda 'Money Bags', that's what they calling me
Shitting on you boys like I'm sitting on the toilet seat
Why M.O.B. we on that Soprano shit
Everyday we blowing cash we be on that hammer shit

Like you can't touch this
Like you can't touch us with a pipe
But we can touch whoever we like
You could even do Lil Chuckee, Lil Twist, KY, Bobby V, Lil Scrap
Didn't say me, cause I got a wife
So sorry not tonight


You see I hope your math is right
Take you body as a sacrifice
You see them flashing lights
Welcome to afterlife



I told her go make your rap for a real nigga
Gonna do the super soaker for a trill nigga
Just lay back I make a deal with ya
Bust it wide open girl yeah i’mma deal with ya
See i’ve been getting money since Hilfiger
Million dollar shit yeah i’m talking real scrillia
Taking back when the feds had the phones tapped
Taking back would a niggas had them zones wrapped
Rub my bands fight to bands baby rub a bands
Rub a bands on the stacks i’m the rubber man
Pray to the weed god please keep a nigga high
Money over everything mama sing the lullaby
Been drinking out the bottles since I was a toddler
That’s why I been ballin like it ain’t no tomorrow
Yeah I said the jealous niggas hatin me
Yeah you know bad bitches into me
Yeah what’s up

She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will

Yeah, I tell her “now go on, pop that pussy for me”
Haters can’t see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I’m all about “i” give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that “wine and dine”
Try to check me and i’mma have ‘em checkin’ pulses
They say chose wisely, that’s why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, it’s the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took it’s mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But i’m ray charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!




Target practice, baby
Only thing is
I'm not the shooter
I'm the bullet bitch

They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up, I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history e'ry day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..

You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

Yeah, what you want
And if you strapped, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, i'm on that dry cush
And when it comes to that paper i stack books
Yeah, You heard what i said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap, you're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee, shoutout my nigga Fee
See every muthafucka at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin in, so tell me what you see
Its about money, it's bigger than me
I told my homies, "Don't kill him, bring the nigga to me," yeah
Don't miss, you fuckin with the hitmen
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again

You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's more because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life
'Fore you knock the boy, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight, there's limits on the ave
Tryin to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up



Look here
SB donks, five-seven-five jeans
Five thousand dollars on my fuckin wallet chain
I be wildin maine, I'mma island man
There ain't nothin' else by me mane
I tell em float on and go on to the ozone
Im so gone, my blunt like a pole long
I prolong, and hold on
To it like a trombone, I'm so blown
And um, I got that cock back, I don't need that thumb bone
So come on, you get the one with the drum on, it
That's that one that goes dit, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit
I'm so terrific when I spit, put my foot up in your ass
Now I'm kickin in your shit
Now I'm pitchin at your bitch
And she catch it with her lip, naw she catch it wit her mouth
And since im the president, she tried to catch it on her blouse
I tell her whoa, easy baby
I'm king cake, so she eat the baby
Wait, shit gets way more crazier
We flipped the bitch like she was in the gymnasium
I ain't fuckin with them bitches with that stadium
Thats no dome, bitch go home... b bi bitch, bitch go home

Bitch I spent a hundred winters on my snow cone
Lil nigga walking like he get his bowl on
Boss man, pimp stroll, pimp stroll
I can let my money go when the wind blow
Bet it come right back like a rental
And bet them bitches understand me like 10-4
Niggas is simple, like instrumentals
I bet you bitches understand me like info
Get your top chopped, and get trimmed low
Sumn like my Benzo
Riding with my friends hoes
No I mean my hoes friends
Fucking all my hoes friends
Takin all my hoes ends, that what make the globe spin
I tell these young niggas; pimp or die
Dont get that Benz, if they dont split them i's
Dig them thighs, thin them ties
And if you reach at I
I don't preach I speech and give you beef wit them fries
Come to the beach and find
I live where all the little seagulls fly
See, baby I'm so high
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride
Bitch bitch shut up and ride

Look, and me and Mac was just two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the lion and he the young bull
Not Sammy the bull
That pistol on my hip then I got a hammy to pull
I had a Lammy in school, I think it was diablo red
I'm T.I. red, I'm t.i.red, you d.i.ed because of what you said
Chea, I'm as sharp as an image
And I keep it bumpin like a motherfuckin blemish
Two twins drink me up like Guinness
When I'm finished I say "Brilliant!"
When I'm finished they say "Weezy you killed it"
I hop on your shit and they say "Weezy you healed it"
So fly, got wings tattooed on me, the gun glued on me
But I pop you in your stomach, now I got ya yesterdays food on me
Now that was real rude, homie
And I smell like a weed plant
Young Money motherfucker, where cheese at



Here you are, sir, just how you like
Careful, it's hot
Enjoy...

Okay, come be my appetizer
My fruit, my apple cider, my colada
My papaya, how you want it?
I told the waiter what I wanted
I told him don't bring me a plate
If it don't have a rapper on it
Chef Angel on the beat
And me I'm just snackin' on it
Yeah, I'm eatin' with my hands
I'm gonna need a napkin, homie
You lookin' like a glazed pig
With an apple on it
I'mma need a Snapple, homie
And another after, homie
Snap crackle, homie
There goes another rapper
Just consider that bologna
You are just a macaroni
In my tuna casserole
I'm gettin' fat and you bony
You lookin' like Nicole
Richie call me Biggie
I got faith and soul
Bowl of french of fries
Tell 'em bonjour
Boy, I eat your food
Hot and cold
And I'm no where near full

Hope you enjoyed your appetizer
Here's your main course...

Good 'cause I'm bout hungrier than a mothafucka
Finger lickin' good never been a thumb sucker
I eat your ass good, never leave a crumb sucka
Never been a club hopper I'm a club jumper
That mean I get the club jumpin', I'm grubbin
Rappers say, "Hello Wayne", I reply, "What up supper?"
I could fry your ass up a saute
Marinade ya all day
I like my shit saute
'Cause all the rappers salty
'Cause all the rappers fault me
For bein' the best of all thee
Rappers call on me
'Cause I'm the best rapper rappin'
Rappers you can call me
The best rapper rappin'
I'm a dog I'm a beast
I'm a feast
Carter get it in order
Order me I oughta be an artery
'Cause I'm a bloody buzzin' B
I'm a beast I at least
Should get a piece of that pie
Before I die
Because I if no one else deserve
Now where is my dessert?

And now for dessert...

Yes, this is dessert
For his and hers
I'll take his her
Kiss her
Make her pussy purr
Wet zipper
Never tip her
Never fall in love with a stripper
Like strawberries, I dip her
In whip cream, I whip her
I let her melt, then sip her
Like sizzurp, I'm tryna quit the sizzurp
'Cause moms say quit the sizzurp
But my auntie mom trippin', she a tripper
And I can eat you quicker
But I'm gonna take my time with it
Like a 3 legged cake I gotta climb in it
But ain't shit sweet when I'm in it
When I'm in it, I told her you gonna miss me
If I hit it
I'm done with it
And can't one else can do what I done with it
Not what I done did it
My tongue drippin'
Feed me rappers or feed me beats


Young Mula Baby, hehe



I all nighted, I every dayed it
And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch
I ain't an asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood gang sworm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't cost me a 100 thou

Put my money, money where my mouth is

Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J.O.-
Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perico if I need to for the Root of Evil
One life to live - notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels dripping, big tooly
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme-spitter
Every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic
Because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, 9-6 to "Reasonable Doubt"
Temper short; don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah you shining, but the only thing you're leaving out
You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out

Barrel on the burner big enough to spit a hundred midgets
I'm from the crescent city, moving nothing less than fifty
That's more shells than you'll find in the seat
And you don't need to know your alphabets to recognize a G
I'm in the lambo making doughnuts like I work for Krispy Kreme
Excuse my flossin', dawg I'm still known to tote a snub

Burners on the front seat in case a hater come that close
Bodies drop when the shotty pop they'll probably make your body rock

Body rock, yep, nigga, lean with it rock with it
Thang that make you lean, I be seen round the clock with it

Clip longer than a bitch if a nigga trip pop it on in give a nigga that shit
Pull it right over and park that whip, everybody better run when the trunk gone lift

Cash Money

Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Cut the music up in my phone
Living in a world a fantasy
Perfect
His back against the wall

Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart bitch like the times are medieval
Married to the block, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you straight to the needle
The bottle, the battle, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband used to beat you?
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck either
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
I am her voice and the world is my speaker
I'm speaking

Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall

With my spine up against these tagged up brickwalls
Flip grams, quick hand, quicksand, pitfalls
Big balls intact through error Syntac's
The stormy weather where the trees don't bend back
Left home at 16, I ain't never been back
When it come to being broke they say I never been flat
A punk ass bitch, I ain't never been that
Reminisce on daddy's caught a schlitz in his lap
And it's Newport Box with only one stick left
Snort heroine, then he shove me in his chest
Used to really believe I'll never be the best
Hell must be on my shoulder cause the devil sing the rest
Right on it through his bignes with them poisonous syringes
Beating on my mama, kick the door of the hinges
I wish I was old enough to stop him when he did it
So long ago, but even I can't forget it, so listen

Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall

Demonic in my presence, street corner like a reverend
Trying to find the change, shining lightining light in heaven
Triple 7, triple 6 - tribulations, triple trick
Triple grip, triple spitting like I had a triple lip
Let's make simple sense of the main difference
Angel of Death swing, got a sinner in a clench
Revolver in my fist, earthworm to a fish
Bait on the line, watch me catch 'em with this
Coke fly off compound, off round white rock
Balling like Earl Manigault in his high top
Third eye cyclops, beaten down my five cops
Left for dead and this ain't even my block
Thinking of my pops, thinking of my moms
Rather be just blazing listening to Saigon
Cause when you think up God strike you down
Body full of current, lightning never hit the ground

Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy

I'm fly, my ally is the bird game
The top flew off of my whip, bird brains
Third lane in the back of the first lane
I need Rihanna's "Umbrella" for this purple rain
Earth to wayne, call it Wayne's World
Money money, call 'em Wayne's girls
Young money gangstas
Runnin this shit like a flanker

Listen, who kid? It's the new kid
The Baltimore Buccaneer, the explorer
In Tom Ford linen and a crispy fedora
Caught throwin a tilt
Thought I was the man 'til I puff the open sex, her ass dropped on the silk
The nocturnal hustla, product of the evening
Gritty, runnin through New York City like the thieving
Time to up the ante
Pockets uncanny
Bulging Kim pussy pressed against the panty
Now I'm in Vermont, and done funny in Miami
Duckin rat packs like Sinatra and Sammy
Trust me, I've been underneath the tap
Doin time, pressin jeans underneath the mat
Waitin on feet up
Now I hate to speed up
My g, you wanna ride?
You gotta raise the front seat up

All these other rappers bore me
They say Twista, won't you take this to your laboratory
No ones in the category
Talk about your swagger for me
Nobody fuckin wit Twist'
I be havin to fill the irrelevant
And then I be killin 'em off with my ana'
It's like I'm a scorpion, like I'm an elephant
Fill 'em with venom and then I'mma stomp 'em into oblivion
Like I'm a million, like I'm a billion
Like I'm a trillion, I'm a gazillion, hey!
Hit 'em in the body with a millimeter then I gotta put 'em in the dirt
Put me in the middle of the money, cuz I know I gotta get it
So I know I gotta work
Grab them since '91, when I came at them differently
I am the first
They be comin and travelin with the dead bodies of rappers
And I am the hearse
Twiiiiistaaaa
I'mma get money killa, stay full of swagger
And that eat'cha beat'cha

Check my swag, I travel like sound dawg
You play hard and I'm gravel like ground dawg
I'm underground, call me groundhog
Lay down lawns, I'm the ground law
Don't confuse me with the law,naw
But just confuse me with my pa because I am the Birdman J.R
I ain't trippin' boy, I play the corner like Ripken boy
With the 40 Cal Ripken boy,rip a boy
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack your baby momma but I'll let the kid live
Cause the real guys still ride on big wheels
Okay,okay you're running with a Don
Come through nice ice bucket on my arm
Top kick back like I know a lil karate
Mommy like Wayne so she show a lean body
We blow a lil blunt... and
I got it in my pants man
Because I am hotter than a fire
Real shining light the thing I got up in my tires
I'm a one seven scholar
I son ya all boys
Ya all Kevin Johnsons
I don't play ball I play guard every dollar
I'm going hard and your girl behind me
And I came so fast that she had to rewind me



Okay, I don't, I don't give a football about what ya'll
Think about Lil Tune, I'm just hoping that it's good thoughts
Yeah, entertainment sports on your network
I love top 10 plays, yessir, best work
Live on TV, mama told me wear a dress shirt
Instead I wore a t-shirt, Michael Jordan sneakers
Red Sox ballcap my dreadlocks fall back
I still think I'm fly, show me where the tarmac
They say I'm taking over, I'm like where do I start at
Green Bay Packer but New Orleans where my heart at
LA Laker fan, let's give Drake a hand
For costing the Toronto Raptors 25 grand, I'm gone



Y'all dudes money too young
Big thighs with brown-eyes

It's Lil Weezy for real
Only Cash Money Hot Boy that stood still
I got a good deal
I'm from a trill hood
I smoke real good
Slide on them skinnies in the bike with an ill hood
Pipes, rally stripes and fog lights
T-shirt white, three stripes with all ice
What that boy name
Birdman Jr., huh
Four was mild but five is so wild
I can smoke a green mile
Got a chrome need a Rolls shined up for you baby
Bling-blow, I rock a throwback Jordan 23
Rolling on hot 23's
Tote a big Glock 23
You're looking at the seventeen ward of New Orleans
My block living me
I want you to look hard at some easy money
Stop playing this is Weezy company
Uh-huh


I'm the son of Cash Money
The fodd of the squad
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Cuz I'm so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bed
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please don't play cuz I'm connected like Sprint
Ladies on the tray popping up the back-end
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
It's Lil Weezy
Somethin' on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took
Cuz I'm a player hold the game by the book


Some call me Weezy
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne
In that booger-green lay like should've been Mace
Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays
Forget it I'mma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze
So move over what you say shortie
We could do rent pussy
Normally I wouldn't but beating through the Texas
And beating went to the A
Eat with Jazze Pha
But yeah I'm on my way
Cuz I know he got that hay
Hey little mami
You a ghetto fire tin
You come to my post on the island
Come on that chronic
He-he empty vodka bottles
I be high he be drunk that my roll model
I rolls by you with my seat reclining
When I stop rims don't keep spinning they keep shining
Money don't stop keep spinning and keep grinding
Cash Money what you hollering, huh




I pop my trunk and everybody get to running
The "fireman" bitch like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin' to get a dozen
My name like honey, it got a lot of bitches buzzing
The neck of the barrel is so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin' and Monch like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on-point like an arrow
Street nigga baby I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life like a man with a gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle

Live from the 504 it's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water yep I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the squid
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster
Y-you don't want to crash like la la labambas

I got them 24 inches, sittin on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch I can't hear nothin'
Though I might do the Spurs, sittin' on them Tim Duncan's
And in that lamborghini, I do donuts like dunkin
How come every bad bitch with a pussy, wanna fuck 'em
But I just feed 'em drugs, and watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was 100, and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow, I just go no huddle
Baby girl gettin' straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle



I be like why not?
My nigga Khaled in here with me
I fucks with my homie

Young boy call me Weezy F Baby
Got a whole lot of money, and a bunch of ways to make it
I'mma country ass nigga got diamonds in my teeth ho
Chopper that I'm toting make me feel like Deebo
Rock a nigga boat then speed off on the speedboat
Take a nigga ho and skeet all in her speedo's
Take a nigga ho and show her how to break a kilo
Show the bitch how to turn a bird into a beetle
We So F Baby, no cliche
Just money, hard dick, no foreplay
Standing in the court way, fuck what the court say
There's money on the corner baby, welcome to my workplace
Sippin' with my drink laced, you know how I get down
I promise baby I'mma fall asleep if I sit down
Uptown his town, Hollygrove hizzound
Fuck with the little man, you will never get found
211 187, I'm on a mission
Mother fuck whoever higher, but I gotta get mine
This time I'm going for the big climb
And the boy about to incline, Jigga man I'm nearby
Little ass niggas, stand tall like I'm 6'9"

See all these new rappers got me missin' Biggie and Pac
And all these fake Jacobs made me get rid of my watch
And Hollygrove you can't get rid of my block
With all these big-heads, you'd think this was Benjamin's block homie
Cinnamon drop hop out spit at your pops
Behind mine, I'll do 10 in the box nigga
My neck of the woods is Uptown ask for me
Young Maine, Young Money, Cash Money, Fast Money
Had the fiends hittin' the wall thinkin' that they crash dummies
While you little petty hustlers struggling for gas money
I'm on a full tank, bitch I'm bout me
You'll probably catch me and Weezy Baby on South Beach
In back of the Phantom the TVs playing
Whether it's the streets or the CDs, y'all gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me

If you lookin' for me I be with your bitch nigga
And everybody know the Birdman the king
And he love his son Wayne so he give me everything
And that's the logics nigga watch it
Keep my name up outta that nigga gossip
Money gon' drain like a brand new faucet
Aren't you conscious? alert for the coppers
They give us the work then throw us in jail
Don't smile for the cameras gotta know when to sail
I'm blowin' an L, low in the 12
I ain't trippin' on life, I'm a go when I shall
I'm a gangsta baby I'm a gangsta
Weezy Baby please say the baby



Since I've lost you I'm lost too
Nigga feeling like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you in your heart too
God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2
Hard to be friends for the day you come back to me
Sayin that you forgive me
Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney
I don't want a advance
Give me back her hands give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I f**ked up
I know I f**ked up, I admit I f**ked up, but everybody f**ks up
Now this southern nigga lucked up
Telling me and my click don't give a f**k
Cuz I'm from new Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was a soldier
I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster. Bang

You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
But There Is Something You Forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my strength
And give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she'd be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I can bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap

You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
But There Is Something You Forgot

But I hope u haven't forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if u pray then u can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why you even go and get a like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you babe
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don't worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen

And all I can do is dream. Damn

I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You
I'm Pretending, and That's All I Can Do
The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart

I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal
To tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it's Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room I'm laughin, cause it's lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?

You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
Always Trying, To Keep It Under Control
You Got It Down, And You're Well On Your Way To The Top
But There Is Something You Forgot

Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g's in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my 1 liners rule these dynamers
Smellin rosé on my breath, on ex brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall …………?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
Always Trying, To Keep It Under Control
You Got It Down, And You're Well On Your Way To The
But There Is Something You Forgot

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way bout anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You
I'm Pretending, And Thats All I Can Do
The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart



Been runnin for too long
Been runnin for too long
Time to, time to gimme mine
Time to time to gimme mine
It's time to gimme mine

Yeah! What they talkin' bout Fee? they ain't saying shit
Nigga, we could hold court like Stan Smith
Or Judge Judy, you niggas better shoot me
Don't confuse me
No, they don't amuse me
I come after the money, like wednesday come after tuesday
I told stunna I'm wildin', he say 'don't worry I gotcha'
He told me 'cut they heads off, and bring them back to papa
Yeah! Them niggas getting scurred! Wurrd?
All that talk was just a whole bunch of verb
Pussy ass nigga got a whole bunch a nerve
I have em puttin' your picture on a bunch of shirts
Cuz I smoke a lot of weed, and drink a whole bunch of syrup
I like brain, so I fucks with a whole bunch of nerds


Money is the topic baby
See I'm a giant, all these other niggas mocking baby
They microscopic baby
Big crib, I can't even hear em knocking baby
Headed to the top, like I'm tied to a rocket baby
To all the foreign women, lets make a tropic baby
I got so many bitches, I could make a compilation
I'd like to thank the haters, for your cooperation
I got that doctor chopper, if you want operation
Niggas this is my crusaders, kill for confirmation
We all got on masks, we bout to toxic waste em'
If they don't pay for you, they get you back dead
Real talk, stop walking on your back leg
Step into the lime light, bullshit backstage
I used to tote a 32 up in my crack days
I tote that AK47 in my rap days


But since I'm the president, I be a little more politic ha
I chillin' in the clinic
And guess how many nurses I got working on my dizick
Snakes in the grass, rats, and lizards
But round here snitches don't exist like wizards
Ho this ain't punch, I'm sippin' on some syzurp
I roll a fat joint and do my fingers like scissors
The game so cold, I done had my share of blizzards
And now I got that big money running like rivers
Nigga, I'm here to get my shit straight
Burner on the hip waist
Yeah I'm from the hood, but now I'm living in a rich way
That's why I got on my knees and thank God for this day
So say watchu wanna say, I need to throw a cup of water in my face
First place I

For me it's business time
Yea, love and hate

And I point a AK
Right at the witness line
I'm on the paper chase
Fuck what they say
The only date marked on my calendar is payday
And you could never get it free like AJ
But I could get you more keys than Dre Day
All I do is call Capito Bergante
I just gotta call Capito Bergante


I never stop grindin
Even if Simon
Said it
I'm tryna clean up like an edit
And if anything comes in town we let it
If not we get it
And put your life on credit
Jetted
Up the block
Did the cop
After the kid
With the rock
In his sock
Fuck the neighborhood watch
As soon as enough money is in my knot
I'm yellin "Who got them keys"
Like the game's on lock
My aims on, I'm locked
Like I spot
But my eyeballs are gunshots, they pop
Outta my head
When you show me the bread
And I bet I could get a chicken
If you sold me an egg
Have ho's walk the strip
Like they owed me a leg
And it's money over bitches
No Al and Peg
Bundy
And on Monday
I ain't thinkin bout Tuesday
Cause anyday could be my doomsday
I'm a hustla


Shit yeah
Money machines
Big stacks of money in jeans
Never ridin on teens
These is grown folk

Fuck with a President
Like Marilyn Monroe
Evidence won't show

Thousand dollar jeans on nigga keep going
Keep walking, piece on
You won’t find me in my beach home
I’m out ya reach arm
I got a speech for ‘em, um
Fuck them and whoever know ‘em, one
I’m stepping in Roberto's with a nasty ass virgo
She feeling my gangsta, I ain’t even have to game her
But that came natural sort of like magical
I disappear when I dip in the bathroom
But I’ll be back soon fucking wit them raccoons
Like Jackie Gleason on his honeymoon
What up Fuke?

Hot Spitter in the building
Young Money in the arena
Ya catch me with two bad bitches between us

I cook good crack in a pot in a pot i pissed in
Yall niggas just talking yall politicians
With the wind against my back I defend in the attack
By any man I’m in fact, ha ha
And its like that
My impact so hard if I die
I probably bounce right back
I walk around with a mice trap
Niggas wit cheese don’t like rats
And despite that
I been around a few gold fish
I’m still a shark out the ocean
I wear the fuck out the 0 6, 4 sent flow
Like I’m 4'6", left arm so stiff
Yall don’t shit about this stuntin’ business
I’m about to teach that to all of my bitches
But, back to the business

I'm about what I shout boy
The loudest mouth of the South boy
I'm from the dirty dirty
You can't get me out my shop boy
I got a money clip but like what for
I tote whole stacks, they can't hold that

And pull her seven jeans down she like fuck drawls
And I'm like fuck that but she thought I was ignorant
Approached her like a gentleman
Her friends trying to get with him but
I already been with them
They all act the same I fucked them all
Man they like synonyms
I like dividends, I might give her them
She the niggas I'm with I might give her them

I don't know how he get so many girls, and rap
And handle like that, and the lyrics!
It's cool though, if y'all listening to him and y'all like all that

Curren$y the Hot Spitta
The new gentleman
2005, YM mother fucker



Rest In Peace Lil Naughty
Fuck you bitches, Coppers

Yea, You Understand?
This here's real man
Harsh but hard
If you can't take it
You damn sure can't take the weight

Momma had to hustle cause my pop was jive
Momma had 1 son 2 jobs
What a woman! Come from where the women gotta work like men
So we ain't need dad we got money like him
No school clothes no child support
And next year I'll probably be up in a Robb Report
I'm important so is my clique I'm riding for them
God lead us not into dividing waters
Guide my daughter see that she walk a straight one
Them fake guys, please see that she don't date one
I live positive stay away from snitches, haters and broke niggas with they face hung
All the folks are ready for whenever that day come
Got a cool two million hiding until that case comes see me just a a riding to the bass drum
So if you feel me put ya blunts in the air
And blaze one and don't cry

Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
I pop me a pill so I don't feel the pain just to tell y'all this shit
For the hood!

I'm on the grind like all the time
I got money but murder don't cost a dime
So I'm flossing mine and if jacking me cross ya mind you done lost ya mind
All sorts and kinds of car jewels clothing
I'm looking like a porcupine
How sharp am I?
But niggas wanna bring out the dark in I
But me I'm so bright I keep walking by
Keep barking hater yeah ya talk a lot but me I'm at the top and I ain't talking down
Man they acting like they don't know I'm from Apple & Eagle
But the eagle will bust ya apple fo sho
So I'm gonna let it rock
Until they let Bubba out the cell block
Ima hold it down let the whole bottles pop
And light the weed up
Straighten ya collar
Fix ya G up and don't cry!

Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man and
I remember the look on your face momma when them doctors told you I made it your son is gonna be aight he made it
I remembered then they come in there and they asked me did I wanna see you
I told them no
I was only scared
This some crazy shit

I got shot when I was 12
Lost my pop when I was 14
Shot again at 20 will I shake these old dreams
Lord wake me up to holy water on my face and 3 blood drops dried on the side of my eyes
Why we gotta kill our own kind when we rise
Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
Pulling up on my nephews
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill
I remember when if you was a hustler you was a winner
Now that's like raking up leaves in the winter
And that ain't even cool to miss a few summers
Shit
I'll take a bite out the onion like
Fuck it!
And won't cry

Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man and
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
And straight level vodka's the potion, makes me spill my emotion and
Keep on coming with that gangsta music young Weezy got that mother fucking gangsta music

Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me

I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet
Then i landed on two and i walked on through
What can you do when you living like me
Get fly in the house leave the pimpin in the street
As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me

And mommy used to tell me one day some girl gone get me
But I won't know love if it walk right up and hit me
And if I fall to the ground I get up and fight another round
And I got money on my mind, money on my mind, but now

I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl


Damn I'm just thinking home 3 winner
Chirping late night, she had the light up antenna
Voices far from ?
13 speaking like we 23 sometimes I would even miss dinner
Cause talking with you felt more important than Jordan's release when the 17's, remember
I get em, similar to any girl I've mentioned
They only thought I'd mention I'm only playing with your intuition
Your senses sensed that I was different
But too flashy for boyfriend material
But I beg to differ
And this is it I'm showing you more material
Now listen, let's Kiss, like Gene Simmons
I've got a vision, fuck a title
We the perfect image, you and I
No eyein' them, them girls, you be eyein' them, cause they be eyein' him
They water stronger than vitamins
Loving you to death, I didn't expect
Beautiful girls, make you suicidal
I guess I'm dyin' then..

Up jump the boogie, and shorty said she feeling my flavor
And even when I ain't looking, I got her on my radar
And yes I know man I am so, so blessed to have her
So yesterday, today, and the day after; I keep thinking of you
I keep thinking of you


Shorty said she feeling my swag
Shorty said she feeling my style
I keep thinking about her
About you, about you

I keep, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep, I keep, thinking of you I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you
All the things I could do, I could do them to you
And I'm thinking of you, thinking of you

Young Moulah baby
I spilled my drink
Change your drawers baby
Will somebody please please double-cup me



The block is hot, the cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like spazzes come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the law's comin', hey, it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, out of control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like anbesol
But he heard

Uh oh
There go them fuckin po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner

I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin
Hem gangstas doin time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist it because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tec's
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fitted
Be on the block until them souljas hit it
That's when he heard....

Blocka
Me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner

All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin, shit is boomin
The hottest D in town lookin for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin qp's to ki's
Gangin in the cheese, them bricks is comin
No droughts I don't sit on nothin
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay em a visit
That's when ya heard....

Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run these streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner


Uh oh, you better get off the corner, skirt
Blocka, you better get off the corner
Come here, you better get off the corner
Get off the corner, Get off the corner
What, uh oh, get off the corner
What, uh oh, you better off the corner
What, uh oh, you better off the corner
What, uh oh, you better off the corner
Like dat, Get off the corner

And I ain't tryin to lose my main girl
I say its Cashmoney mother fuckin records, Waynes world
I had conversations, with other top women
We talked about going steady but I wasent ready
I haven't got in it.I was not wit it
Because the pussy at home was my own
My thrown is ready, the seats warm
As soon as we get out the rain we se a storm
And you went throughout my veins in every arm. So even throughout the pain im very calm
These niggas talkin bout my bitch and how they fucked her
And how they hate her. And how they used to love her
And I almost left, I was weak. And we still move in unis every week
Im sorry

And now im feelin like pac, me and my girlfriend
Death to all you other bitch niggas, hope ya world end
No reunion, No records. Nigga fuck yall I wish I never met ya

Bad bitch in mi casa
No mi casa is su casa
My choppa go doom-da-da ay-ay-adda

Tunchi bitch on my Future shit
I'm too legit I sleep on a crucifix
I wake up cranky turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch and buy orange juice and grits
Oozie clip I need another oozie clip
I shoot to kill these pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real your head just a souvenir
She want to get it off her chest but her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter V on an Ipod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said "soon as these niggas hear your new shit they gon' have to give their styles back"
I say "you too crazy" she said "you too humble"
I say "you too baby" she said "you too sweet"
Then I ask do she go both ways
She said "they do say love is a two way street"
I say ooh
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine she gon' want to shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum I gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
I sell birds to the bees I sell birds to the trees
"Tune I heard you don't sleep" I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk but I tweak for that purp for that pink
Ya you see what I'm saying like you heard what I see
I'm a verbal disease I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets since my curtains were sheets
Chefs on these beats I'm just stiring the grease
That bitch you in love when she working for me
I personally get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers I'm at peace
Word I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart street smart I'm a nerd I'm a geek
I'm absurd I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money time served and release
But this agent ain't free word
That's just word on these streets
But that shit is old news that shit yester-week
I'm just focused, focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi you good" I'm like Bob yes sire
Don't, I mean don't, don't question me let me breath
Dawg, big dawg, I cock back and shoot at your fleas
Money long tree trunk, now stand under me catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees but repeat what you heard you a dead parakeet
This Tunechi bitch your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on the balcony we watch the moon eclipse
We do the usual shit she gon' need lube for this
Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world she like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events lord
I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put a nigga's body in an ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up to the skyline
Thinking to myself you only live twice slime
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place where the high crime rate Iran
We put your ass on nigthtline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline but they never try mine
Spinning like I'm sipping cyanide
Why my bitch sipping Mai Tai but she wine fine
And I'm so sorry she said don't be sorry
Then she said don't apologize for shit cause you the shit and we know the Carter V the shit




Help!, Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!, Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!, Help!

So sick need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the toc, when I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock give me a sec
In the middle of the war where my enemy at
I'm running this shit like an Eric Bieniemy back
Cause every time I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
I attack before you begin to react
I'm from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag
It's Weezy baby with this hustle until infinity, ya
Like somebody let the dog out the kennel and ran
Whoever did it was a very smart women or man
Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band
I need y'all to arch your hands and pray for me
I need...




Check
What?
What?

You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick
Or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'mma pop one in your grill!"
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt
Smell me?

Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em

Look
I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita
Give me the yay, or else I'mma put her in her sneakers
Me, Turk, Geezy, and 'Nile - chicka-POW!
How come these niggas keep burnin the world?
And why the hell this nigga Wheezy keep firmin your girl?
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal Bentley drop
Then I'mma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
When you see them bullets that my Glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em
See this for all my niggas in the pen, I hope for freedom
And this for all my niggas buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come
Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?

Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em

See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em

Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place
Mask the face, automatic attach to waist
You bastards play? Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
And they gon' either get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them Glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, run up in your crib
While your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nothing other than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?

Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
Cause when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em

Who wan' beef with a nigga? Creep with a nigga?
When it comes down to guns, look, I sleep with them triggas

And I would leave but I had to take a minute in the smokin section
Tryin to let the pain ease
Watchin her plane leave
Trippin in the smoking section
Tryin to regain me
How can I get a grip when I lost my main squeeze
And now im stuck inside of an ashtray
Like a cigarette
But my heart pumps gasoline
And this she know
I just crashed and burned
Now here come the smoke

Up in smoke

Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section

U would think I was sure but it feels so wrong
A piece of me is strayed over still with you

Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section

Pay your cable bill and you tryna watch the Saints
On the 60 inch Hitachi, living like Liberace
Sporting the latest Versace

{LIl Wayne- Verse 1}
Im walkin thru the street
Wit 24s on my feet
A nigga got whips
Like a farmer got sheep
And as a matter fact
I got sheeps like a farmer man
I ain't playin
I jus bought a brand new lamb
T tops like a old trans am
Pull up at the light on a bitch like BAM
N from the side view she still kno who I am
A smokin nigga and bobbin my head to my jam
Im prolly on that deaf
Im prolly on that cam
All pink diamonds lookin like spam
All white porshe lookin like the clam
All white seats lookin like a gram
You cannot stop a flow
Not even wit a dam
Im fresher than a mufucka
Cleaner than a sham
And a bitch couldn't pass me
If she crammed

Six speed coupes the only thing that the boy order
Im paid n full so im stuntin like rich porter
Y pull up 2 the club in a charger
When I can pull up in a damn super charger
No tints chromed out chub super larger
My money sittin high
Ya money leanin low
U need 2 play the lotto
Cuz u need the dough
C ya in the lotta
Cuz I b the dough
Artermarv standout like a pornstar
My maserati roxy reynolds thats my porn car
So take ya top off
And ya bra off while I wait to the telly right here it pop off
And to the dealer n drop that loot
500 cash on drop and coupe
And shorty that im wit yea she drop dead cute

I told ya
I roll on dub
N I gets much love
Red diamonds on me
The color of cold blood
White diamonds on me
The color of soap sudds
Light brown leather like im sittin on mud
We might bust caps
But we never ride hubbs
Pocket full of leaf
Car full of wood like im ridin in a tree
But im higher than a tree
I ain't flyer than a bird
But im ridin on a wing
Big car
Big rims
Sucker what
Lips pokin out
N I b ridin by myslf
Leanin so low you think my car was drivin by itself
N when I sail through the street

Daddy I'm a pitcher, who's the next batter
I whip it like gadda and I throw it right at em
Junior high school, high school when I had em
Had 10 dollar bags 25 dollar package
We ain't even in the same lane, stop lacking
Damn even Mack Maine tell me i'm macking
Nigga stop trippin, bitch shake ya laffy taffy
This is New Orleans classic, young Wayne the main attraction

I got that goose in my system, somebody gone be my victim

Talkin with ya bitch, meeting with ya bitch, creeping with ya bitch Now I'm sleepin with ya bitch
You can keep her, she a bitch
I don't love her, I don't trust her
Nigga own mother told me the bitch loves to hustle
Gotta get that paper baby, gotta get that cake
Cop a black lamborghini, put gold on the plates
Gone to the beach, sand at my feet
R1 one wheel hanging off the seat
My nigga Lil Naughty was down town g
We use to blow 2 or 3, tell him all about the streets
My nigga Soulja Slim had the mutha fuckn message

Lil Naughty we use to get red eye, Can't believe my nigga dead ah
Lil Soulja he meant what he said ah, Can't believe that nigga dead ah

My nigga Lil Spitta that's my nigga all day
First bullet out the barrel nigga better guard your face
My nigga Lil Spitta he in the game let's play
He about to take over for my half time break

Now once upon a time not long ago
He was in the hospital and damn near broke
And all he had was a mask and a Glock
A box of baking soda and a couple of pots
The streets was empty, the fiends was hungry
He wanted to give em just what they wanted
To get cheap coke all he needed was connect
So he called his homie Wayne from the Hollygrove set

Then I got his call,  I'll be on the way
Don't worry about nothing but that money to be made
Met up Spitter we got the shit straight and I gave him the dope and I kept the ye
Now we on the grind and the bitches know who we are
I come through in the car like gosh
My posture as delicate as fur, I'm all hers
Cut niggas head like barbers
Fruity ass niggas is starburst
Throw em in the ceiling fans
Little Wayne Weezy Baby motherfucking triggaman
Yea yea, throw em in the ceiling fans
Little Wayne Weezy Baby motherfucking triggaman
Yea yea the motherfucking triggaman



And who I be? Weezy Baby, and honey please, say the baby
And I got em on they knees, saying baby
I'm a goodfella, they bout to make me
But I been made ho, I been paid ho
I spent 2000 dollas on these shades ho'
I'm red hot, I'm ice cold
I got enough cheese, keep me out that mice hole
I got nice hoes, I got bad bitches
Yea, Daddy's rich I got their bitches

Back for the Motha Fuckn title its your idle
Get money 'til I die, got my hand on the bible
I'm a scrap what I'm writing wit a hand full of rifle
If ya man feelin Eifel, Imma make his ass leeeeaaan
Yeeah, 60 grand cut the lights on, 40 grand for the floor cut the mic on
Thats right ho, Hawaiian punch sprite so purple wit the 'tuss
Bitch I'm on that leaaaan
Yeah, and I'm on that green
Won a championship I'm still on that team
Yeah, and I'm ya woman's dream
Hah, and I'm so damn clean
These leaves cost a stack, that's throw back jeans
You wouldn't know that you don't roll like me

Hey where we from, new orleans
Hurricanes pussy poppa's murder scenes
Presidential shit, monica lewinsky

Ridin' in the caddy mo'
Blowin like sachmo
I'm highly strapped low
Baby go from what ya know
Tinteds turn pictures change new photo different frame
Money up, champagne, still posin', same game
Cash money still, do it for the money
Gotta black car, grey car, gas car, green car
Backyard theme park, front yard car show
I'm somewhere in the house
And it's like where's waldo?
Ten bricks straight powder air cargo
Weezy F. straight hustlin' no barcode
You don't know what my heart holds, straight fuel
Take ya bitch from the club make her ass a mule
Put some weight on her back make her ass move
She give daddy money back that's a fast move
40 G's one chain, that's a man jewels
45 for the Jag dude

Hey where we from, new orleans
Hurricanes pussy poppa's murder scenes
Presidential shit, monica lewinsky

Uh, smooth out my mansion to my whip
I leave the bullshit inside wit my bitch
I move the heavy ass gun from my hip
Then I sit the same heavy ass strap on my lap
I'm steady as crack wit the strap
I'm heavy as da-white but Dwayne not fat
I'm right like Betty and the fetti is the facts
The Birdman Junior holla back where ya stack
I'm just tryin' to let my hair back
And chill where they got some air at, Ya hear dat?
Champagne clear liquor put that beer back
Got work so cheap it's on Sears racks
Holla at me on the low I take care of that
And feds buy mixtapes yeah I'm aware of that
But this here is the suffix you scared of dat
When you get shot you know where ya at
And where we from NEW ORLEANS



I pop some Percocets
Then I pop some Xanax
Sitting back, strapped, cocked
Plotting on your man next
Jack a nigga for his work
And stretch it like some Spandex
He hesitate, I spray and leave him
Like a Tampex – oops, I meant a Tampax
Bitch, I keep that anthrax
I can get your man wacked, for a couple Tan packs
Shoot off your Sedan lap
Nigga, I demand stacks
I ain’t playing, black
Bitch, I be spraying Macs
All type of guns with accessories
I’m like Cosby for the bills
I need mills like Stephanie
Pussy niggas can’t stand next to me
I’ve got dope and ecstasy
Keep em floating like both of the levees breached
80s baby but my soul from the 70s
Worldwide game like a travelled the 7 seas
Niggas ain’t OG, scary lil bitch, please
Tune ate pussy in the can, Frisky

I got 10 up on my pinky ring and 20 on my bracelet
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can’t say shit
I’m just here to separate the real from the fake shit
I told you, I was coming n I’m sorry for the wait
I gotta get this money
Mane, it’s right here in my face
I got the Devil on my back
I don’t wanna be up in that place
My mom tell me to be safe
I just keep running in these streets
I can’t stop fuckin with these hoes
But I say I’m just doing me
Bitch, I’m a 9th Ward nigga
Mason street, D&G
That Flordia right by the D they need to free my nigga B
I ain’t the type of person to be running from no beef
Those fucking guns are gonna be bursting
Somebody knocked off their feet
So watch your fucking mouth
Before you end up on that floor and stop
Acting like you’re hard cause
You know you’ve been a ho
I told you out the gate I’m not the fake
I gotta say it, please excuse
Almost forgot I’m all Dizzy by the way

Money over bitches, bitch I’m coming for the check
Vampire living, bitch I’m coming for your neck
Raw! I’m sharp, my swagger like an X
I’m a motherfucking monster
I rap like I’m possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold her down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be wylin’ with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler the Creator
I’m a Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woopin’
They went crazy when they heard I had a song
With Lil Tunechi, bitch!
Get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer
I’m the one that be producing my music
I’m a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot
Pot is in me
Drop ya like an Otterbox
Sleeping on me like I’m rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga have him thinking that he planking

All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Them goons at your front door, choppers out, ding dong
Didn’t I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring
“Blaka!” is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters
“Pop!” case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed – Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic’s clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sunnydrive and Bronx Tale Cologero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull em hammers out and run them nigga’s like Stockings
Got some niggas from my city
Thugga, Dizzy, Flow
Sorry 4 the Wait, coming soon, Carter IV, bitch!

Oh yes I love her like...
Oh yes I love her like... egyptian
Want a description? her body's sickenin
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician
Sexual healing, I can be her religion
And now shes kneeling, praying to the ceiling
I bless her as if she sneezed
Must be the weather, I dress her, I am her sleeves
I am her feathers, shes fly
Flyer than you, flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love her three... times more than her mom
Time will tell that I'm the nigga
That she should, we should
Be wherever she wanna be
Be on her late night, mid day, AM
Just say when and I know I be with cavemen
But never... mind them
Shes poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know y'all don't hear me
But she does, we does
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink
And I think, we had to much too drink and...
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed
Oh yes I love her like I ought too
I see you at the alter mrs. carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son, more than one
Maybe five like the jacksons
Or john pacson
Just don't let them f*ck up the mansion
And daddy will be home later on
Smelling like the cologne
That I put on this morn
And I hope that you smell like woman soap
And shampoo and lotion
And perfume and candles
And I'm a run thru that pussy like a vandal
Yes I'm nasty as a Scorpio
But I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like shes sweating out a fever
Leave her to me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear to ear
I wanna be beside her when she sleep and she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated, panties are debated
Einstein... her head is the greatest
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed
Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man would ever love her
Oh and I better be the only man
Sticking it, licking it like an envelope
Mailing it, sealing it, read it
I have written down victoria's secret
Don't tell nobody, don't share your body
With nobody, not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep
That as for weezy, baby
And at my station we have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them orient asians
I do me, I say hey miss chung lee
I like to see your booty
Roll like sushi, I'm tryin to dip my celery
Up in her blue cheese
Ah's, oo wee's, wa la's, ta da's
Mhm's, ah ha's, oh yes, never oh no's
Until I have to go, and then it's never oh no
I tell her don't cry, I be back like the electric bill
And when she butt naked she dress to kill!
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed
Oh, oh yes I love her like...

I met her in Victoria's
She was hotter than a crown victoria
I was on her yung joc
She made me lean and rock
I tried to tell her my name but laughed more so
Because she looked like tell me somethin I don't kno
So I told her my number and I got hers also
And of course she knew I had a girl, I wouldn't be in the store
So we hooked up that morning like around 4
And at that time I knew what she was down for
Soon as the door opened, war opened out
She was such a soldier, purple heart pokin out of her fatigues, and she's never fatigued
And with her, whatever I say she believes
And my girl know I got a magic show up my sleeve
But with her, I can disappear when I need
And she say...

She don't even care about my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should I be
Shit
And she don't even wanna be my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me, with me


I met this bad bitch last month
Bona fide freak, we been kickin it for the past month
Or should I say I been hittin it for the past month
David blaine, magic stickin it for the last month
She got that coke bottle ill shape
Thicker than a McDonald's milkshake
We don't go on dates, we have field days
She let me play on her field like a bill's game
And she don't even like football, she just sits home
But she love it when I run it in her inzone
She love to role play and put them wigs on
Yeah, she be gettin her lil' kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is, but with him she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstand's how I wanna be
She said...

She don't even care about her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with a g
And who is he to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should he be
Shit
And she don't want him to be her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with a g
And she gonna do her thang with a g, with a g

Chillin by Elz
And we smoked a hundred L
We spoke about gals
We joked about tales
No homo
But I meant like a storytale
Ya dig

Light skin, long hair

Thick and juicy like steak meat, porterhouse

She keep askin me if we can put a porno out

She don't even do this with her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with him and me
And who are we to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should we be
Shit
She said she would even do my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang, be free
She said she just wanna do her thang, be free
Her, him, and me

Nigga. I'm from a city full of pity these niggas are silly
Kill you in Harlem hit the turnpike in lower Philly
And these little niggas ain't got books in their book bags
Your next neighborhood killer might be who you look past
Get it right before you get left
And sent to the upper room cause your ass couldn't calm down
Rewind me back and you notice I'm trying to warn you
Before your collarbone be what hollows are getting torn through
Play gangasta tonight and you won't see the morn' dew
And the whole next month would be something mother mourn through
God forgive me I know Thou shalt not kill
But id rather him than Millz so if I gotta I will

I'm from New Orlean where the water never clean
So ima gonna shower in some fuckin gasoline
You fuckin with the monster everyday is Halloween
My choppers ain't no doctors but they taking out your spleen
No my riders ain't no robbers but they taking everything
From Mamas to baby Mamas to Papas and we goin to pop up with poppers and leg warmers, barrel way down my jeans
My nigga ain't no fire but I'm a blaze everything
I'm that hollygrove roster and my number 17
Eastside bitch, thats where I come up as a teen
But now I'm the man, and now I'm the man
And this is my land Lilweezyana and New Orleans In the City

H-Town sunnyside this my playground
Home of ... candy paint 808 sound
Styrofoam here it is If you make my syrup spill
Ima put my hands on you like a steering wheel
And we dont feel to kill cause this the pace to cop the work
The cop's a jerk got it so hot its comin out my shirt
You get your mama merked, You know the Glocks will squirt
Cause niggas going out the shrooms and those hoes will pop the purse
Houston Texas who harder than us
With a hundred thousand flipped dope boys get a rush
Hunch of codine and we pour it in the cup, now everybody slower than the short yellow bus
Now everybody know that the boy is the truth
Stay down I team next door to the booth
Ill tell you 16th east exits side street right past is where we roll is where you find me



I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything
Anything, for you

Go DJ, cause that's my DJ
No more producer so, that's my DJ
I know the story, same song, that's a replay
We pressing fast forward
This ain't the last straw
We all ready to shit, don't need an asshole
And if you feeling froggy, leap you little tadpole
Yea it's that cold
But I'm so family fam-o
Got 'em on my back like a camel
I say I got them on my back like ammo
Stop the sweating, damn where did all your fans go?
Cash Money Millionaires, straight cash flow
We don't need nobody else, Lil Weezy got the cash flow
Yea, so flow on lil nigga
Got the company, I can throw on my own lil niggas
And ya'll can team up and come on lil niggas
Ah, stop crying, what's wrong lil niggas?


Hey, the situation ain't all that
And bitches say your conversation ain't all that
And we ain't got the time of day for all that
So bitch nigga get your money and fall back
And in the long run, they gone crawl back
But ya'll got problems Einstein couldn't solve Jack
Don't take it personal, somebody had to jump up
And I happen to have a broom to come and sweep the mess up
It's me
Baby and that's me
And maybe you'll diss me
But fuck it, then it's beef
We laughing at you clowns
You niggas got that hating season passing it around
But we still got caskets in the basement
Burners on the counters and tats on our faces
Yea this is what you want
You said it was a publicity stunt
Well bitch I'm a stunner




Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg? I'm on some, some adult grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Jeezy, Juvie, Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg

Age is nothing but some digits, nigga trust me on this
Cause I think I speak for everyone when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L, gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip cause haters likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catching rights to her lip behind diapers and shit
But I like me a spliff drink henny without the ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly
And I know I might be young but nigga gone definitely respect me
But in the mean while I'm fighting gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up, but I smoke bout 3 blunts
And puff a cooler boost me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Just so I get through the stuff, but I be like

Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinking everything's a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff, just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
And I'm often on the edge stuck without a solution
Someway I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
Cause y'all cats don't really know me, y'all just know about me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never say I thought they ain't appreciate what I do
But just know if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through, but I be like


Who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic?
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
And I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully changed
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm wasting a man
And if I want it, then I get, and if I need it, I have it
Take care of them family first, plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I ain't ask for you to like me, I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me, no other man can never make me or break me
Now I be faithfully inspired by the hood til I'm gone
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own, but I be like


Believe Dat



I can't feel my face the ablum
Now watch me put dis beat 2 sleep like a valium
Neva mind me I just are who I are
A flat footed niga dat walk what he talk
Off 2 da bar pop a few bottles
Straight up out dat water wit my mark jacob goggles
And I go hard like a brett favre spiral
Bytchs n they draws and niggas in denial
Hollagrove harlem pump up the volume
David banner beat bytch butt like a stallion
Touch my medallion and meet my berretta
Leaving you lookin like a burger wit extra ketchup
Now throw yo sets up
We fuck sets up
We pick shells up
You pick ya chest up
Im on my one two's like a push up
L's is filling like a cook up

Money in the bank
Watcha think
Money in the pocket
Yea I got it
Bytches get plugged like sockets
I lauch slugs like rockets

Living like a gangsta get it like a hustla
Ya girl friend backed up stick her wit da plumber
Baseball batter louisville slugger

Ice ticker homie betta b getting ya cash up
My wrist Antarctica my neck is Alaska
My pinky is the north pole call me Santa
I spit nicotine call me cancer

I really dont give a fuck about ya
Wat im saying is that a nigga would take yo heart out cha
And in the neighborhood my face is like a voucher
I swear I keep that gun on guard like a bouncer
A ounce of that kush I smoke that kush
And I run this muthafucker like reggie bush
New orleans crook
Give me wat I took
Me and my money
Thats a good book



Modern day gangsta, old school playa
A fine display of greatness at it's greatest
Send an array of strays at any patriot
Breaking down K's instead of quarters, it's kettle water
Please, no more zip locks or shoe boxes
My little niggas in school got shit now
All of the teachers in the school got fixed
When they seen me in the streets they give me gifts
I ain't riffing or raffing or rapping or yapping
No I ain't from the Nolia, but I'm clapping
No I ain't into coke, but I have it
No I ain't into dope, but I stock it
Like I ain't got the po in my pocket
No I don't like they clothes but I cop it
The white man looking like I ain't fit to go in my pocket
No I ain't fit to stop I'm still poppin
Holla, like I ain't at your throat
I'm a turtle neck collar
Our purpose is respect with a capital R
Whoever don't die today, they'll be back tomorrow nigga
I'm on a Harley, cruising by rides
With the stogey in my mouth, Makeveli in the iPod
Weezy F., nine milli and the eye's lied
Make you think that was a fire squad

So I can't see you, all you see is Evisu signs

I was like, "Dawg, how much we gon' make for this?"

Cause I'm from the south or don't really be boastin' and braggin' 'bout that flow and shit
Dawg I got this shit, dawg, you niggas think you could fuck with me?

Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
Cause I’m killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I’m done

Ayo Breezy, let me show you how to keep the dice rolling when you're doing that thing over there, homie
Let's go!
Cause I'm feeling like I’m running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
See they really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Everytime I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing that nigga think that he be doing
Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing
I gotta do a lot of things that make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and in again
And I be doing it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the east and I'm bangin' in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
See the way we on and we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
And we always gotta do it and take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it


Man, fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doin’?
I’m Lil Tunechi, I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dressed like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I’m not even trying
Whats poppin’ slime? Nothin’ five, and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight, bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down

Okay, okay
Is that right?
I’m fresher than a motherfucker
TRACK 4 ON F.A.M.E



Can they remember me?
Lil Weezy

Let 'em know how you've been thuggin

All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama, and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle
Grind and struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress
Them niggas there with big Willy
Me, I'm full of that dilly
Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'
Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds
Shorty, wow
Hair... all over my head
Bandana 'round my braids
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench
When niggas play, they get drenched
My pockets is full of lint
So, nigga, stay off the bend, I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my father, I've been troubled hurt and disturbed
So Ion even hesitate to leave 'em on tha curb
And wet them niggas shirt, nigga, get 'em for them birds
Tell them niggas, Geezy!

Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

Look, look
At times I forgot tha bills
Ain't been home in two weeks
Macita lookin' for me
Tha word all over tha streets
Well, shiiit! I love my momma
But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems
I lay back in tha cut
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here
The lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow
I can't see it, I don' dropped my pile on tha floor
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders
Well, picture this, I gotta call from this ole' nigga Beatrice


Lemme tell 'em
Blunt in his mouth, would stayed masked up in the drought
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!"
That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs
Lots of thugs... make niggas count the ants in the mud
Some niggas choose ta come back for me, ride around my set for me
Might start jackin' because I got that SKS with me
Cause, see, ya'll got it
And Right now I'm doin' bad
So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag
I'm street-livin'... week for week
No-sleep livin'
Look outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'
My heat sizzlin'
I'm ready to sweep these niggas
Geezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!


Look, remember that?



Look, you don't remember me?

I remember ya, nigga




I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front of a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' something that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro, don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for me and my fuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas, vice versa
Eyes red from the kush I blew, white person
Got my middle finger on the trigger
And with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas
Except my niggas

I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga



Weezy f baby

I shouldn’t have to say that shit again
And you should never make me

Rappers talking the same shit
Im just saying though
Trying to stack a lot of chips
Whenever the hate come I pack mo clips
It ain't nothing for me to mac a chick
But I ain't like that homie you can keep that trick
See im money over bitches for real
Yall trickin and lickin
Im big pimpin like nigga for real
Give a fuck Ima say what I feel
Anytime anywhere
Have fame before I got my deal
Still riding through the hood
Smoke blunts with my niggas and bitches

Chi town what up your boy ain't left

Plus that cranberry range so sick

Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes

Im beefing with a chick
My ex old lady
Always tryna fight a nigga when she see me in the club
Starting to get sick of it, thinking bout calling the polices
On this crazy make em put her in them cuffs
Why? Cause ive had enough of that broad
She won't learn her lesson until she end up in the cop car
Yeah but I don’t want to take it that far
But I know she sue me if she end up with a cracked jaw
Maine said her that will back her up
My mom said point her out she will smack her up
Truth be told I guess im with her
Talking all this shit I will probably end up right back with her

Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes

And tell me if you see just as much gangster as I feel, Y'know?
Cause that there is all I can be man
That there is just me man
W-E-E-Z-Y
WE! Hey!

Wayne deep in the grova, out comes the small soldier
Alcohol and douja, bother my composure
Oh lord, am I supposed to be this way?
Do I live no good? This may be wrong but it feel so good
Far from home, I still feel so hood
I got the set on my belly
That shit gon' be there till a nigga get buried
I ain't scary, bring it, I'm ready
I be on them Antera's to the cranberry
Handle the whip like Andretti
And I handle a bitch like my man Nelly
I move a rainbow lambo on mo-mo's
As far as dough go, I'm up like no-do's
Bet I never sweats no ho
I don't get no type of threats from no foe's
I don't threat the po-po's cause I don't respect the po-po's
Many say that I possess a dope flow, and I accept
Cause when I'm being Weezy I'm at my best

And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

I ball hard like a small guard
The small boy sliding out a large toy
Me fall off? Naw boy, I'm a stand through it
The flow deserving ovation so clap your hands to it
The flow is real so A-man to it, jam to it
..been a minute since Block is Hot, this is man music
..had opinions for Block is Hot but this is grand music
..hand, blew it because the bands who damn igloo it
..and I ram the damn dick to your people's people/
Get mo' booty than Benzino's single, from bi-sexual to bi-lingual
After I sex you up it's "bye skeezer"
And I see you later baby, I'm a player
The chrome wide, fee on the five g/
I sit deep wit my heat 'case shit gets steep
Weezy a dirty south boy, I eat pig feet
I'm just me.. foreal, I'm just me

And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

And nah I'll pro'lly never kill nobody, but I've pointed my pistol
And those of you who I pointed it at, I'll still kill ya
I'm still familiar wit the hustle
I could go dope, weed or coke, bet I'll never see broke
And I know to never say never but whatever, I never felt better than now
I'm 19, I'm a veteran now
When I.. step out my house I need weaponry now
Fuck around and I bet it be bloaw, YEAH!
And they.. wondering how I get so rich as a child
Remember, I was before Romeo and Bow Wow/
Shit, I had O's way befo' Romeo or Bow Wow
But no disrespect my daughter crazy bout 'em
And.. notice how you notice nothing's fake about me
There's something great about me
And I'm still young so there's plenty more to break about me
And people brace yourselves, place yourselves in these 7 and a halves
You don't know the half, and tell me who can walk my path
Not a soul
Your boy live his life on the edge.. Geronimo
..the endge, Geronimo!/

And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

I can't change, I'm a gangsta!
This is me people, you can either, love me or hate me
But no matter what I'm a always be me man!
W-E-E-Z-Y, WE!
That be me
There's only one word for me
Gangsta!



Runnin' from the scene, Hammer in my jeans
Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real "Gangsta Gangsta" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'mma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but

Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me!

Yeah, money on the mind, murder in the plans
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam
Hustler by law, support when I can
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time
And I know my niggas love me, but they can't do mine
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
Get lost or get in line
But the carpet's still fine
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece
Keep Firin'




No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go
I'ma go by myself, I come in by myself, so I guess it's all about me and it's fuck you


Come on home biscuit,for man's sake
No more fake hugs and handshakes
Stand straight, you sweeter than a pancake
Me, I'm trying to get that green like the landscape
As for my team, originate
See what I gotta say can't wait
I demand cake
Gotta eat, keep the family straight
They all holding out they hands and plates
Yeah, Wayne's from a place called Hollygrove from the bottom of the globe
Area code 5-0-4
Be hero Joe and I zero in with the Eagle and there'll be no him
I don't need no help, I don't need no homie
I don't need nobody - nigga, I got money
Nigga, I got heart to go along with the guns
Call me Weezy F. Baby, I be by myself when I cum, yeah

I don't need 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't trust 'em
So mothafucka I was born by myself with my dick in my hand
With my mind on a million dollar plan
Now baby, you are looking at the million dollar man
And I'ma die alone, so alone I stand

The only passenger in my coupe with two seats
Damn, what is it Holmes? Ya boy's breath soft
Air fake, I can feel the silicone
You're all a bunch of Pamela Andersons
And it seems like my day one niggas ain't acting like day one niggas
I ain't changed, I just came up, niggas
And trust me when I say I ain't put the streets down or them things up, nigga
Bring the Phantom through the hood, I ain't fronting on y'all
Just tryna let you know it's bigger than the corner, my dog
I ain't playing basketball, but I'm ballin' for sure


The rims may offend you on the shit I slide into
Fuck you, send ya to the desert, tell ya be cool
Ahem, hold on the pistols
Roll by the cops and turn up the stereo
Sittin' at the corner, lookin' like a owner
Talkin' to the owner, yeah my price goin' up
All in the strip club, never get a boner
Only get hard for dough, I'm Homer
And you're a Simpson, and I'm a pimp, son
And she ain't comin' to the crib 'til her friend come
We gettin' money over here, you need to get some
Out comes the cold steel for my income

Out comes the cold steel for my victims
Born alone, die alone, but you could die with them
Cars white and sexy like Nicole Kidman
Bad chick by my side, video vixen
Ya might fly to L.A. just to shop at Kitson
Thousand dollar hoodies, I'm pickin' up about fifteen
That's about fifteen thousand, I'm trickin'
Swarovski crystals, Great China Wall
And my money run longer than the Great China Wall
And my pockets is Mediterranean Sea deep





I'm on my grind, fuck bitches money on my mind
Ho get in line, respect me like a stop sign
I'm in my prime, the brights you see it's my time
But fuck my wrists I need that money in my palm
Sellin palm trees, in beaches in shorts sleeves
Fly your beach down here bet ya she won't leave
Exspensive car keys and glasses, t-shirts, pants's
I keep money on me like dancers, Si
Everybody got problems, and money is the answer
The teacher ain't pickin everybody with they hands up
What are we to do but get paid, get ya grass up
Number one fan of the money, join the fan club
These boys don't know paper like I know paper
Nigga I'm still on 2004 paper, I'm tryin to get some more paper
I ain't tryin to die with no paper, that's why a nigga stay....


First Class LV's on the luggage V-8's in the car this the life how you want it
I do it big easy does it hows I does it when I does it pretty chicks every night and we fuckin
I get paper get cash get ass later, it's money first ass later skip past haters
The brown paper bag taker, straight to the dealer, just give me paper tags i'll take her
Then, I leave out with the sun roof cracked blowin weed out, two fingers up, yup peace out
I sense money like bees sense honey like k-9 dogs sense drugs I sense it all
I got alot but I'm sensing more, and if you fuckin with my money then I'm sensing war
I smell a war send it on I'm a G too, bonafide known to ride see you when I see you

W-E-E-Z-Y Wee
Bitch holla!



Can I speak on how I feel y'all?
Let my heart do the talking
Listen up princess

I wake up in the morning, take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eyes
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you been gone
I have been all alone
But alone is steroids, 'cause it made me strong
Girl, hair gone in the wind
Ya cheated on God's son, baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rearview
And I put that ring on your finger, I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn

And now I'm by myself, but
Damn, she left me all by myself, but

I love my niggas, no homo
I swear I hope they all get cheese, like Digiorno
And something 'bout the Hot Boys that you don't know
I got a lot of love for 'em that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front do'
I hope Chopper City Records blow, fo sho'
And me and Juvey never really got along
But you still would let your nigga
Come get on your hottest song
Damn, I fuck with ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back
When you see a real nigga you gotta tip your hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissing me on the mixtape
'Cause he's locked up and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry bout than me
I ain't trippin

Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front
And so, now I became the President
Of the spot y'all left me at
A lot has changed, but, I can't front



When you look into the mirror in the morning
Co you recognize who you see
When I look into the mirror in the morning
I don’t see anything
What happens when the sun don’t rise and the birdies don’t wana sing
And even the flowers of the day die and then they stink
And then they shrink
And even the friend of mine says the shrink might work
And I was thinking bout clearing my mind but im afraid it might hurt
And just when it seem that I got the whole world at my door
The bell ring and I open up with a bang

Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for the worlld the the the world
Im ready for the worlld the the the world

Wait til they get a load of me

Psychotic, my pilot left the air craft
Good weed like im smoking on some tear gas
How ya want I can specify mother fucker
Snearker sceintist I second high the mother fucker
Pissed off no more like shittin on
Get it good bitch I get til the getting gone
Big dawg are the kittens home

Opening

Hmm yall ain't ready tho I get so much green they call me lil ready go
Is you ready 4 5 and the the leather coat and shoot these mother fuckers and whoever cope
Somebody better let em know I ended the banana clip in and in your cantaloupe
Fruity niggas suck a dick fuck the world, I'd rather fuck a bitch
Starin at the walls of the room figurin out how to get out
And theres no window to escape your mental drought
You think about the crossroads more than the man that's conducting the train
And then you lift your protected you still can't fuck lil wayne



Look, where I go from here?
Just lost my father last year
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone
Rabbit come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm comin man
Just wait at the gates, I'mma be runnin man
Arms open, eyes wide, full of love
You watched me come up from a scrub
Now ya see ya son ridin every day on dubs
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And Cita; Ms. Rose, Sheryl, Kevin, and plus Senitra
Dawg, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool livin off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me

It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel

Alright I know it, see I got a child
I know I'm young, but when you left dawg, thangs got wild
I know you probably sayin 'damn, you raisin children now?'
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby makin millions now
So I still smile
I'm takin care ya wife brah
Ain't nothin changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'
Thangs go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though
So you know who payin the bills now, ah hah
Still flossin, give my audience the chills, ah hah
I got all my game from you, nigga I ain't gon' lie
But I'm still thuggin nigga, playa you think I ain't gon' ride?
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, Hummers and Jags around me
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me


I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me everytime, watchin yo' lil boy shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me
And I'mma prove it, and show ya daddy, it's up to me


Look, Rabbit...nigga love you bruh
I mean it's up to me man
Just watch over me
And it's gon' be all gravy man
Slim and B, treat me all good
Love you dog...
Rest in peace ya heard me

Handle your business big dog....Fa sho'!



I know these girls names...
Hold up, hold up

Let me tell you about maria, she let me high, Aalyah
Thank God I ain't blind, I fuck her every time I see her
And get a beer from Sophia, You probably in that area
I know a bitch named Dominique, She live here by the beach
Her pussy get pet when you kiss Her on the cheek
Used to fuck her every week, but now We don't speak
Cause I fuck her best friend, Angelina, she got a face
Like a Appleonia, her body like a lollipop
She rode me like a Horse

....



Cmon

Kickin rocks on the block, tellin all the OG's
I be comin for ya spot, when ya not lookin
Hot cookin mama got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked k's came through
Some soft, some stepped on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas comin thought I saw the cop lights but
I was dreamin, then I woke the junkies was still fiendin
And I had coke so, I had hope you may say that its wrong
But I ain't talkin to ya child I'm talkin to this song
I'm just, doin a buck down memory lane
If I crash just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same but they quicker to bang
And if they do then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway
And I would do the honors any day
And tell ya honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the stage like I whip through the yay
Show ya ass how to take 4 and get 8
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
Weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop workin with that thinner weight
Getcha brakes fixed
Stop playin, cause all we know is gun-play
Trip while ya fall and my clip gone be empty
When the stomachs get empty anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kid's sake
Hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't gotta place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way pussies, relocate
Y'all know us when you see us putcha jewels up
Putcha cars putcha clothes putcha shoes up
It's that serious homie pick the news up
It wasn't good nigga, think about the hood nigga

The people who ain't, never had shit ain't gon never have shit
Bullshit, cause they still gon try to manage
Niggas doing anything like I don't understand em
But please understand this
Niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothin lost families
Lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic
There goes the stashes

But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce back seeming like magic
Shit, well call me Sigfried
Watch how I turn one ki to a hundred G's
Summer please know I live for ya
Throw on the wife beater let back the lid for ya
A few years I'll probably hear from ya
But now I'm here for ya
I know niggas that'll shed a tear for ya
Behind bars tryin to get to ya, and probably never see ya
This that real talk if ya ever heard it homie
Shit hurts so much I might have to hurt ya homie
No commercial no frontin no curve on it
No cut tell life, "so what?"
The droughts here not only white's slowed up
The weed's slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck it, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? how we gettin on?
Where hes sittin at? what hes sittin on
Stand up if you know its true
The end of the world comin and my city the proof, damn
Chyea, and this if after disaster
This ain't rap this is recap
Steppin off the G-4 still strapped
Bust ya head in the air that's a skycap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off, cause it don't go where i reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents gotta dump the bodies
Birdman as long as we gone eat, then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reachin
And I'ma get there through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything pause I can see it
I'ma leader, me, the son of Jacita
Fuck the world not the people



You looking at a soldier
Bitch I'm the sure thing
Born and raised in the middle of a poor ring
I turned a bad thing into a good thing
Listenin to malcom feelin like i've been hoodwinked
I could think about tomorrow and its promises
But I'mma just load my gat on some survival shit
And when I hear they got a drought on it
I take a month out of rap and I hustle til I'm out of it
Yeah, you can smell the work in the car seats
Smell you in the trunk if you at all speak
Shit, I got diamonds on my neck bitch and all my teeth
52 carrots, bugs bunny, all drug money
I got an x-connect on the west coast
I buy 'em for five and sell 'em for twenty mo' Fo' sho
I'm nice with the flow
But a chosen few know
That I'm a hustla on the low

Look into the eyes of a hustla baby
Yeah, money I'mma get it
And the second I get it
Its money ova bitches
Yeah, you know its money ova bitches
Now go get my money

Take it out the wrapper
Sit it on the stove
Break a gram off and put it in my bitch nose
She tells me how it feels
She's numb, She's froze
Bitch! Wake up and help me cook these hoes
I gotta get my cake up cause all I eat is dough
I'm a dangerous mothafucka watch your feets, your toes
I bang this mothafucka you can't keep the clothes
Thats your mouth we're talkin bout
Stop jumpin out your face
Before I have a hundred bugs shots jumpin out ya face
One shot will knock your girlfriends scrungie out of place
Tony Dungie I dont play I coach
Ho, I spray raid on the cockroach, die slow
I know my flow is hotter than 50
Summertime in Hollygrove
Thats the stove
As he drove that black bentley coupe through the city
All the bitches try to get me and I let 'em


Aye, I got twenty on my wrists
Thats a rainy day schedule
Rain drop diamonds nigga
Thats a rainy day bezzle
Yellow diamond earings
Sunny day special
Its vicious my niggas
Its eyeview I'd straight catch you
The bitches on the sidelines
Looking for the rescue
But I just give 'em guidelines
Hard dicks and pistols
5 hard, 5 soft, wrapped up in tissue
Say bitch you better get back before I start to miss you
Its the carter baby pardon all my issues
I gotta get it I'm a hustla to my tennis shoe
Tell them boys come on in the swimming pool
Send a fool
Then I eat 'em up like dinner food
And I'm floatin with keys in the inner tube
They prolly see my driving with pounds in the 22's
All 51 rounds in the 47
Dope boy, dope boy
Thats what they all yelling




I'm on one
I'm on one
I said I'm on one
DJ Kalik
I'm getting so cold
I ain't work this hard since I was 18
Apologise if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest

I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8?s
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
And it's double M G until I get the chair

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might aswell say cheese for the pictures
Ohhh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one
Get them all
Get them all
Get them all

Pullin' up on the side is a suicide
Aye, you just a run-of-the-mill nigga

Drop my girl off, pick up the enzo
Ridin' through Hileah, ride through Kendall
Ride through Carol City, ride through Overtown
Where they leave dat ass on the ground
But you say that they know you now
But the difference is when dey see ya, will they hold ya down
See P grew up with a heroine pedal?
They made fun of me cause I was a odd fellow
See I was half skate park I was half ghetto
But you cut me open then u seen my bones made of metal
Here's my DNA yes it was essential
Unlike your aftermarket Roley Presidential

Cause our money longer than the nose of da bitches?
And, and for my shows do ya know what I'm gettin'?

Extra extra read about it
But we get twisted laugh and smoke weed about it
And can't nobody do a thing about it
Cause they'll be in the same boat
Literally the same boat
Floatin across the same sea
Thru the same water
Don't fuck wit them same G's
Don't fuck wit that man please
Don't fuck wit his money
Don't fuck wit his gang breed

Day dreamin'
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day

Day dreamin'!

You already know
What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low
I'mma be a G until the day that I go
I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow

Shhh...
I can hear the reaper comin'
But I ain't scared
Oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Now when I walk past, you might see an extra shadow
Angels on my shoulders are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there, cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me "don't get murked, or get locked up"
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride with my Glocks up
You already know


I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life
You might see me on the side of the road
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
'Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cold
It's so cold

I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
You ain't never do nothing for a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had into a pool
You get up on the news, lying about how the levy's broke
Now Weezy lost 2 Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions
You took everything we had, Uncle Sam, you Satan fan




Weezy F Baby, F ya ladies so quick so fast
No lines, no laughs, just wine and grass
And sometimes they might lie in grass
Whatchu know bout getting coke sucked off my dick then put it in her ass?
Im nasty huh? But she like that shit though
So I like that trick ho but never wife that bitch, no
But never mind that bitch though, got plenty more
Hen' and Mo', women know.. Weezy Deuce Bigalow
So tell ya crew hello
The game come with the boy, the boy come with the game bitch I'm a GameBoy

We strap up shut the fuck up and dippity do what we gotta

And you don't want me to step out my shoes and step out my groove and let out my tools
The hammer kill, the hammer will make you stop, drop and roll like you slipped on a banana peel
Live by the code and honor honor the code
Stop snitchin, be a man nigga honor your role

You see that coke turn to oil it's on, nigga it's on
You see that hard base and the water is soft
Gimme that ice lemme show you it's on, nigga it's on

Come equipped with them sizzlers for the blizzard
Here's a sick sickle for you and your lil niggas

Just bought a new Glock 40 shots hair trigger
Shots through the driver side that mean the driver died

Millimeters red dot find the spot
Head shot body drop

Wear a lot of carrots and I smoke the best green
No beef, in my grocery bag
Just some Swisher's and a whole bunch of cans of Whoop Ass

Young Weezy Baby
Come to tell you all today about a lil’ problem I be having, oh man see its like…

When I’m down in the studio tryna make a track
My girl be at home all over my back
And every time I say that’s what I’m doing
She don’t think it’s what I’m doing
When its her that I’d rather be doing
But right now I’m in the studio making this track
My girl at home all over my back
She blowin’ up my phone
She tells me she’s alone
I say I won’t be long, let me finish this song
But right now I’m in the studio eating this track
My girl at home begging me to come back
Okay I’m coming home, and when I get home
Girl I’m gonna kill it like I’m killing this song
But right now I’m in the studio

Man just record me
And even with a equals sign you couldn’t pause me
Haha
Yeah, this is the office
Come be my secretary baby this is the office
And my office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10
I’mma say it again
My office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10


Man just record me
My girl at home all discombodied
Lady, but baby I’m just recording
And you gotta know I’d rather do this than party
Man, don’t get me started
You think I’m crazy, my bitch retarded
But that’s my bitch regardless
Yeah


Man, just record your boy
If I sound a lil’ pissed, disregard ya boy
My baby girl really acting like a baby sending text
Stressed, tryna make it hard for ya boy
I’m like shawty better use your toy
See a nigga never absent but I might be taughty
Lordy, Lordy, I likes to party
See I could be with two freaks about to have an orgy
Or I could be with Pamela, could be with Audrey
And as soon as Angel records me
That’s more Gucci, more Prada, more Louie V
See every verse bring us closer to our dream house
Now we closer to the things that we dream ’bout
And when I get home I ain’t tryna go to sleep
You know I’mma dig deep but right now I’m OT in the studio




Yeah, C3 baby
Young Weezy and Young Curren$y
You understand me?
This how we doing it

Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls, and girls
Di-diamonds and —

Get 'em
Like five, six chains on
Slick Rick, no patch just frames on
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-neck
Ten bitches, ten pistols on the P-jet
In a drop top Madina with the top up
I'm in that bitch getting neck like a shot put
Hundred thousand for the grill, if I lie, I die
Flow sick, so sick, see the cyanide
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an I.D
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F.B., the money is the matter
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B


Hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain, more colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at them
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
Yeah, hot spitter nigga, who you thought it was
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I don't try to lock them down cause I am not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped
Pimping serious
Make them bring it back like pass interferance


Speed boat, wife-beater
Ballin' like Derek Jeter for every reason
That Testarossa can get ghost like it never seen ya
The same color as sesame-a, diarrhea
The pioneer-a, I am here-a, right here-a
The watch nasty like gonorrhea
Money long like Nia, I appear-a via satellite
Whomever don't like the premiere, he a hermaphrodite
Vegetables up in my ear-a, get it clear
Pretty women want this nigga right here-a like Richard Gere
I switch the gear, and steer and disappear
And if I ever jump off a pier I would probably fly




Take 'em to church

Momma don't cry
I know papa gone away
Grandpa gone and grandma ain't coming home today
Don't worry cause your son’s still the one
Though I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that
But I changed my name to Wayne
And nigga I ain't goin back
I'm kinda little but I figured I’d be bigger if I sold crack
So I sold that
OG’s from the block told me "Youngin hold that"
So I held dat
Got on front street and then I fell back
Became well at cookin it til it smell flat
Vaseline it up and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
Junior High was prison
High school was the bail out
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
Than a baby bottom in new Pampers on campus

This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap

My Mama Mia ain't raise no Fredo
And Rabbit showed me how to make more out of quelo
You gotta make that thing flow like a ?
And keep getting money like I'm on the payroll
And if anybody slowing the payroll
I gotta turn his fitted cap to a halo
So get adapt to the case loads of crack
The yayo, the smack
The face blows, the gats
Photogenic, we expose a rat
And turn that ho into tomatoes or plants
And yeah I smoke back to back to back
Like I’m on two tracks but you ain't feeling that
I'm ducking the county boys with they billy bats
I got my dogs with me lookin out for silly cats
Ball with me
Weezy where the city at
And If I fall stay up
Cuz I’ma get it back


This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap

People always tell me I'm heavy I say believe that
But I don't get all full off the feedback
I'm where the G's at
We like “where the G’s at?”
Kick door, hands high or get your knees blacked
If I don't take everything I'ma be back
And I'm stickin to my word like bees wax
He acts an asshole for these stacks
C Notes not B Flats, ya understand me
Few leaves left the sole tree standing
Just as quick as the wind blew they went too
I’m in too deep, my roots go deeper than the spot
Where their bodies shouldn’t sleep
I probably shouldn’t speak like that
But it be like that
Never let a nigga with a knife see my back
I’m outta here
Let me see my hat
And I rock it so low I can’t see where I’m at


This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap



Yeah
We are, Young Mula
And we run this bitch

Roll with duct tape and ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and r-r-r-r-ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and r-r-r-r-ride with the Mack

Slide out the Ferrari, I came to wet up the party
And baby I can shoot like Robert Horry or Corey Maggette
Ready for the impossible, I'm colossal, fool
And y'all niggas just molecules
Don't know how to build a house but I got a box of tools
I'm talkin' 'bout that "pop pop, pap pap, bang bang, blocka boom
That is for Tune
The coupe I'm in say "va va voom", then it go pe'hune
Nigga I'm gone
I'll see you soon, on the moon
Put me in the dirt and watch me bloom
Put me in the jungle, bet I'm coming back with all the food
Put me in the streets and bet I'm coming back with money
I'm heavily blunted, me and my gun loaded
She ridin' with me 'til the muthafuckin' road end
Yeah, and it be like that
I don't got papers on that Glock
But I got papers on that Mack



I ain't have a body on it, but don't nobody own it
So anybody can get it if anybody wants it
Homie, I'm not your homie
You fuck around and end up wrapped up
In the trunk like a fucking mummy
Phony, I'm far from phony
I'm only about my money
And I keep enough of work to feed a thousand junkies
I stay strapped cause I keep a couple thousand on me
And I know these little cronies that's plottin' on me
But I ain't never scared
I ain't never runnin'
I got my own back
I ain't never frontin'
And I'm forever thuggin'
No heart, I don't care for nothin'
And no sir, I ain't here for nothin'
Then I'm trying to bring it back like the record's jumpin'
I got my system pumpin'
And I'm riding with the Mack and the duct tape in case I gotta carry somethin'



I got real fucking blood flowing through my pulmonary veins
I play the kitchen, call me "Culinary Maine"
Y'all niggas bitches, ya'll hustlin' on the scary train
While we move everything, from heroin to Mary Jane
But let me fall back, I know the Feds like rap
That's how I know the mic tapped
When you don't brush your teeth
The only time you touch plaques
While we got too many on the wall
Yeah, it's like that
I got chicks that like me that don't like rap
Ask your girl who her favorite
I bet she say she like Mack
I tell a dark-skinned chick I'm allergic to chocolate
So if we eating use the plan and you can keep on walking
Hi Yellow Mamis, I don't eat red meat
I'm busy killing tracks
No child support
I pay with my heart, I kill it
I probably never be the best
But one of the realest




Nigga i'm young as a muhfucka
But money a muhfucka
Young money muthafucka, get it in blood puddles
Shit, i'm in the south but we living in mud puddles
Shit is a drug stuggle when you niggas upping prices
I hug the Glock like a turn buckle
Can't get stop by the vices, no license
Rolling like dices on the street
Where the eyeses hide
Where the crime is life
And the life is time, and the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin
The judge probley hit me with an algebraic expression
But I get away free like oceans elevan
And i'm motioned to meddle, like a pro-fe-ssional
And when i;m rolling expecially like a pimp suppose to
Watch how you sit down somethings in that sofa
If she with me, you know theres something in that ho bra
She's a foreigner so she say coca
I get broke off and they get brok-er
They like so what, i'm like so when?
We going know then how the turn in turn out
Cause we going shoot back till the burners burn out
Till the burning burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollering at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me there's a thousand blind folds
And my mind state just put a thousand on top of those
Chea, I do school and do lunch at popadoes
They want beef I'll turn to that to sloppy joes
Copy cats brrrrrrat, copy those
Had a strong relationshp with expensive cloths
This stuntin shit is expensive and intense
Like pulling up in something Americans can't invent
Chea, I make them fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence, shit
Im way smarter man, im more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
Im so im so so lifted, high in the sky
Me and pops taking pictures
Thats my vision and untill my vision
Is vivid ima give it all I got we good jigga you bitches



Yeah that’s Mack Maine right there, and we ain’t got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain’t got no worries

Tunechi in this bitch, e’rybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be digging me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleek
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I sent them up shits creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It’s ok if you turn up just don’t turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I’m smoking I grew it
These are Blood gang Piru, all rats gotta die even Stewart
On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don’t get dissed, you get disfigured
She said sorry I didn’t shave so that pussy is a little furry
I put that pussy in my face I ain’t got no worries
Tunechi


We ain’t got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain’t got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar I say why you in a hurry
She say why you asking questions I say bitch you trynna be funny
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that donkey kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bars
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch it’s Tunechi and I’m out here, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit would be a long story

To the sounds of them choppers roaring

Cash Money Hot Boy, bless me when I'm gone
But until then, load up the chrome, cause it's on

Put a boot up in my lip and put my thirty up in a clip
I drop the top and then I dip I hit his block and make 'em flip
And I be full of that trash
I be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast
Watch the bullets chop off the head
And make 'em fall in the grass
One move they all die

Y'all better learn
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell
Well then let 'em burn
Hold 'em fo' ransom, hear me smart boy

Til I R.I.P., C.M.B. I be

All I know is the streets
And how to strap up
When it's time shoot it

It's your boy Weezy, yeah
You need to ride with me on this one

Now in the drop you'll find me
On my way to get you, cause I got you Mami
I know you got some issues tryna stop you Mami
But I'm a little more ahead, let me spot you Mami
I have you, as we drive through the east side
Stop through my honey chrome right along the beach side
Ay, how can I answer at your sweet mind
Tell me 'bout your day
I know I heard about it 3 times
Hah, okay, I'm waitin' on my fourth time
And later on the 5th, so I don't forget
I got my lady in the whip, she got my name on her hip
And she don't let another name out her lip, uh huh, gangsta
See, if I don't play 'round and she gon' stay down
So last summer, I retire my number, ho
So no, I can't jot you my number though
My nigga real think you hot as a mother, but

Baby girl, I know that we can make it through the weather
As long as we strong, everything will stay together
When times get hard, long as we call upon the Lord
Everything will be fine, everything will be fine


I will ne-e-ever leave you girl
Like R. Kelly said, while the R. Kelly played
Full time mother, you work hard everyday
I wake up beside you, thank the Lord everyday
Oh, beautiful woman, I look forward everyday
Just to see that childhood scar on your face, hah
I got a Tony Montana chick
If your girl get out of line, she a manner chick?
If my world get out of line, she program my shit
I know my shit do stink, but she can stand my shit
I got the flip-flop paint on her standard shift
Dot 6 Range Rover, I advance my bitch
How you gon' go get some pants like that
With an ass like that, you know I'm bad for that
But you ain't gotta answer that
Long as every time I call you answer back
I said


Ride with a G and come join me on this adventure
Hop on the beat and put your ass on the 20 inches
I'll slide you the key, you wait for me after the concert
I promise I'll leave straight from the stage to under you skirt
Got riders with me, but don't mind them, they only homies
They only gonna let you get on me, so get on me
The song the DJ playin' is my own, so get on me
I'm only gonna let you get on me, so get on me




Fuck, man I been on this block all day
Hot man, get off my shirt, hot man

Killing them...
And how its gonna go down
Cause right now I'm tired of hustling
And these rocks ain't doing nothing
And to tell you the truth I feel like I be out here for the fun of it
I swear if I don't hit a lick by next month, I'm done with it
I said I could get you paid, is you with that offer?
I know you see me coming through everyday pimpin
In a Benz, the Jag, and a Ferrari
Let me run it down to you bout this shit that I've been getting in
I can't do it all myself, so I need me a lil' solider
I been peeping ya lil' ass, I see you grinding and shit
And you don't even know how long I been trying to find me a brick
To make it flip and take the chips and go an buy me a whip
You worry bout your cake
Once you make enough to play, go buy a Z-28
I'mma go an cop me a Range and two platinum chains
You too young from the start
Its dedication and heart
Don't put your heart in this game
Cause when you fall to deep in love you get caught in this game
And acknowlegde me when I'm right
You ain't my pa
Fifty ki's of raw dope, and fifty bricks of cocaine
Pays five a piece
I'mma knock off my lil' section
You take care of your area
I'mma have Coke and Dope
It's gone be on 'round here
But how you want me to sell this
Zones, Quarters, Halfs, Ki's?
I'mma get me a million
If power get between it I'mma split me a nigga
Let them have it
I bet you be on the block, working - directing traffic

Whispering something you can't understand*}

I go by the name of DJ Khaled
My nigga Birdman say yo Khaled man
Lets do something for the streets
Listen...

Shh...
D-Boy in the B-U-I-L-ding
He who buy and sell things
Feds hear my cell ring
Phone we say ice cream
In jail they don't say too much the codes ain't safe enough
So i'll be on the street and on the road gettin' my paper up
Full but I ain't ate enough
Aye tru turn the faders up
Because diamons are forever
Pluck a diamond from the bezel
Feel the clarity that twinkle on the little one

I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it
I'm feelin' myself
Aye what is this feeling?
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' like....
You got to feel me!

I spit switch blades for the bitch made
I spit bullets at hood niggas
Don't get shot get low boy!
I spit numbers for the dope boys
I tell 'em to meet coke boy
It's more money involved
More money more problems
More problems to solve
Ask a nigga have I ever been in the back of a car
They'll tell you whats up
I ain't bad as fuck but I'm tough enough
That's why...


People try to tell me shit but I don't want to hear 'em
Cause if I tell 'em shit back
Then I'll probably scare 'em
Truth be told I'm the hottest of my era
There will never be a soul that can compare to every level
Ever peddeled by the Devil
Me being the Devil
Hot Boy 'till the grizzle
Gone 'till they miss me
And thats untill the blunts burn out
And the liquor is empty
I ain't trippin' cause I did me
Wait I'm trippin' cause I'm still me
Still the little nigga goin' out to get me
If the public got something to say
Well tell them I got something to say
And that is...




That's right you already know what the fuck it is man
Weezy F motherfuckin' Baby bitch
I know you love me man
A nigga hate me, believe that man
This right here is the Dedication 2, D2!
Drama! Dramatic and the affiliates man
I appreciate everything y'all does for me
I'mma do it for y'all man
Open your motherfuckin' ears
Sit back and watch what I do
That's right the president baby
Right now, I ain't doing nothing but getting money man
I'm just moving man
I'm loving what we do
I'm Cash Money, Young Money to my heart man
I can't complain y'all, I can't complain
I love y'all man
That's all it's about right now for Lil Weezy man
I just - I'm just being Lil Weezy man, Weezy Baby man
So, like I said man we gonna get into this shit man
We gonna do it how we do, let's go



Aw aw
Aw aw!
Aw aw!!
Peep me out, look!
Head bustin', black fatigues
So blunted, 400 degreez, it's Weezy
Nigga, respect it
When you see tha left hand buggin', nigga, respect it
But if you see tha left hand bustin', nigga, your disrespectin'
Took one to tha chest, I never die, I'm tha same brotha
Jump out and shoot K's, let 'em fly, I'm tha same brotha
It's a must they recognize that I'm untamed, brotha
Disconnect a boy like a damn change number
I kill ya, wake ya up, and make you die again
Spark it up, and make a nigga block fry again
Go ta jail, and do life, not five ta ten
Me, Lil' Mario, and Toolie, that's my man, fam
My niggas don't give a Jean-Claude Van Damme
About'chu, cause we don't play around
Bring tha K around, spray tha town, take tha ground
Take tha ground that you walk on
Tap tha phones that you talk on
Jam ya up and take your arms off
I hit you twice with tha sawed-off
And your neck, and just watch your head fall off... fall off
Numb-nut
I run up in your house with a tommy gun, what
I'm standin' there like I don't mind
Run through your clique like a weak defensive line
Yall ain't ready...

You want war, nigga, let's beef... beef
We can do it how ya want, or take it to tha streets... streets
I'll be dressed in camouflage, Ree's on my feet
What ya..ain't know? I'm tha one from tha T.C
On fire, nigga, labeled as a HB
Think it's a game, 'rilla, test my nuts, you'll see
Heads bust if ya really think it's CMB
And I know you all know about Slim and B
We get our ball on, nigga, drink Cristy
Me and Buck get head from meekos in Tennessee
Betta ask somebody, nigga, I been a G
And Baby still servin' niggas for ten a key... nigga

Aw, aw, aw, look
Call me Big Baller, Big Tymer, Big Pockets
Call me Big Stunna, Big Stick, or Big Body
Call me that lil nigga with the rope full of diamonds
Call me the number one Hot Boy on fire
Fire, when you shoot outta town, then I'mma holler
With a crate of Crystile, couple of blunts, and a condom
Let him know if he come at me bad, then I'mma chop him
Ch-uh.. chop him
Put tha flame to him
All of a sudden tha thing hits straight through him
Cause I'm tha same nigga, pimper boy, Lil' Wayne
Thugged out, pants fall to my shoe strings
But since I usually... do the best at thangs
That mean I gotta wear a vest at thangs
I really think them niggas jealous... of tha sparkle in my necklace
Yall ain't ready.. yall ain't ready



It's gravy nigga. Believe it
You hot? Fuck it. Hot as a firecracker

Nigga I'mma tell ya straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack
And I'mma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest
If I don't know shit, I know cars and broads
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off
And I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars
To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream "fuck 'em all!"
I hustle hard in these city streets
I got my block on fire with my HB's
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard
And you can find me
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'
Got the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'
If a nigga get it fucked, then we killin' a bitch

Nigga I'mma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga
Cuz if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga
Look, I'mma tell you this, straight off the top
I got a blunt, and a Glock, and a bag of rocks
Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

Better pay attention now so you don't forget later
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper
Don't make me take ya, play ya
I cock the Glock and spray ya
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salama-laka
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me


See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya
Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild
Cuz all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone
Dog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers
I pop dozens of Glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'mma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

Cash Money hotboys signed for 30-mill
Already was straight now we livin larger
Already was ballin, but now we ballin harder
Cause my wrist stay flossed out
Niggas hate me cause all day I'm flossed out
Ghetto made me
My dog, Baby, saved me
Niggas find out they ho got fucked, they Implicate me
That's how it go
It ain't my fault I got mega cheese

Paperchaser to the fullest get my grind on
Gotta do it cause I made that song Get Yo' Shine On

Me and my click be sizzlin hot steamin
Bouncin' through diamonds high beamin'

A fifteen year old shot caller baby
And I'm racin' through

Got yo' wife at my house
And she naked too
And all my niggas all around her
Sayin 'Shake it Boo, go ahead do what you do'
It's Weezy darlin' and off the heezy darlin'
And I'm surrounded by the ice
It got me freezin' darlin'
And it's plain and simple
Won't change cause it's natural
Lil' Wayne a pimp y'all
Got the game from Beatris
I'm tryin' to see six numbers
Pull up at the Grammy awards in six Hummers
Leave the Grammy awards with six womens
And make her stop at the gas station for six rubbers
Put it together
This is the life when you get full of the cheddar
Don't try to end it or you wouldn't get better, what


La, la, la, la
Here I come star rapper
I get the fast money
Short, cute hot boy that rapper Cash Money
Standin out the roof of my car
And flash hundreds
Take your girl to the mall
Spend a G like that's nothin'
She lay on the floor
Open up the spot
Take off her drawers, and "let me see the cock"
"Don't stop" Lil Weezy, Weezy ain't nothin' nice
Baguettes in my Jesus Christ, nothin' but ice
When they see me at night
Behind tints I stay high
Snatch yo' wife
Run up in her with the K-Y
But it's on man
Ever since I was born Wayne
Nigga get out of line
I get dirty like John Wayne
I'm bout stuntin', flossin'
Whatever come wit it
And I don't shoot guns
Unless they have a drum wit it
At first they wasn't wit it
Thought that I was jokin


*B.G. Talking till fade*



So you didn't get drafted by the NBA, but you got drafted to defend your U.S.A
Now you got war on your mind, put you on front line and you will die, die, the American way

So I woke up at the crack of dawn, a lot going through my mind while I stretch and yawn
Its a love-hate thing, but my heart is torn, man, let me just speak about whats going on
Hey, Dear Mr. President, why you got our troops in the war and they fighting over shit thats irrelevant
While the crime rates spread like an infection, Im trying to duck jail and a lethal injection

Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, lip injection, lethal injection
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, crime rate, lip injection, lethal injection
Lip injection, lethal injection, breast reduction, police corruption
Your assumption, economical destruction, breast reduction
Police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction


What is your fucking problem, I'm from the fucking bottom
I got a bunch of problems, and can't nothing solve them
My room is full of demons, I ain't afraid of them
I hear them witches screaming, I raise a blade to them



Question, what the fuck is you go do, when that new world come for you
When that new world come for you, revolution is never the solution
Prostitution, drug distribution, war contribution, all for the love of the constitution
Yeah

Love, hate, size, race, grime, grace, lip injection, lethal injection
While the crime rates spread like an infection, Im trying to duck jail and a lethal injection
Love, hate, size, race, grime, grace, crime rate, lip injection, lethal injection
Lip injection, lethal injection, breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption
Economical destruction, breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction







We had them bitches that they feel like it was some drug

We had them bitches that they feel like it was some drug
Weezy, Fresh, and Unplugged

Give me a big fine bitch in a dress, one who put them lips in effect
Suck the dick until the shit in her chest
You can piss on her breast, I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick
Give me a Spanish big and sweet ho, black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, specializin in givin me deep throat
Give me head, don't care, swallow cum, don't spit
Aww shit, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girls I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it, it's off the chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brains
But watch them hoes that want the change, it's not a game
Or a short cuban ho, with a fat ass though
Bet I'll treat the bitch just like Fidel Castro

Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

Listen, listen, it's Weezy the hottest, drinkin Barcadis
I stream through the scene in a Lincoln on Robbers
Lookin for the finest dime to wine and dine
Later on I'm tryin to climb behind ya spine
Hold up lil mama, slow ya ass down
Pick ya up, dick up in ya, throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around, and scream me name
A damn shame, better watch that boy he nasty
I strap on de plastic, make ya bounce like elastic
Put the pickle in the middle, make it wiggle for y'all
Might be small, but that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, fat ass and shit
Like sassy, flip like Trina, "Da Baddest Bitch"
Matter of fact when I see her, +Pull+ her +Over+ like a cop
Juvey coulda "Backed It Up" and I'da "Dropped it Like It's Hot"
Haha, Unplugged


I like them big and round, pretty and brown
Now you can bounce slide drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it get a nut, get a nut
Shake for ya hood, bounce for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, hold up, pause
My bitch got thongs, yo' bitch got drawers
My chick like to swallow, yo' chick like to spit
If yo' chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, wait a minute, chill out, stop
My ginseng, viagra, and a strawberry pop
See I'm gettin kinda bold, won't ya bring a friend
From vagina to the asshole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout delta
Yo mama loved a Tymer but now you welcome
You ok lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love my dick

Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'


I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Than peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out

Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out

I'm so Cash Money, right out the rim brotha
Not out to get nothing but bread, I said I am
Not out to get nothing but bread, I said I
Slide out the whip, looking like a million bucks
Don't touch bet this fucking full clip fill ya up
Hollygrove in this bitch blocka block
Make the chef pull the stove off the hip, cook em up


If I was to let the barrel spin
None of you niggas be standing
I pull this burner out my drawers
You gonna piss in ya panties
On the block as a younging
I was working that jelly
Knew fat niggas kept bundles under their belly
I’m a motherfucking Young Money
A motherfucking Cash Money
Millionaire, Cash money Machiavelli
They say dress to kill, but I look better at it
Ready for anything, its covered like spaghetti
I’m a nice young d-boy baby
I digest your man like a t-bone baby
Keep on I got the heat on 80
At 90 I’m shooting, at 100 I’m blazin
Concrete jungle the wild-life pavement
That’s my life, my life, my life baby
Don’t get caught up in the twilight craze
Or you'll be just another highlight baby


Before I had my aim
I still had a pistol
Missing ya whole chest
Hitting ya whole temple
Like 95, 96 getting it in the rental
So short I had to sit on a pillow
Let the whole quaker sit on the griddle
Cook em up and shoot em out like missiles
Boot em up and call em out like bitches
They ain't nothing but bitches
They ain't fucking with this shit
They swinging and missing
My angle is different, they ain’t seeing me
Look into my music, that’s the window to my soul
See the g in me, long hair all black like Easy-E
Little nigga got smack like the DvD
Click-clack sound sweet to me
Click-clack sound sweet to me
Pap-pap you look sleep to me
Good night












Where my niggas at, it's play it raw time baby
Load up the guns guerilla war time baby
Light up the blunts, light up the block time dawg
Choppers with drums, uzi's, and Glock time dawg

Yeah, Who Me?, I'm so fly

Hey princess
Yeah you

Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, knew I looked like a big fool
I must have had the flu, I thought the shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me, what did I do?
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me baby, but you wasn't about me baby
Damn
Young Wayne prepare for change
Cause it seems like girly don't care the same
You had my chain, you buried my name
Then you had champagne

Other people telling me I fell off
Other people telling me I felt y'all
Mama telling me I should at least call
My mind telling me she should at least call
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seesaw
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seashore
But you got to let her be boy
And when you open up your eyes I hope you see more
And when I see you, I see detour
Don't need to be depressed anymore
Baby girl I need more
Now run your mouth until your knees sore

5 carats on her finger got her hand smitten
But everybody get a ring even Scottie Pippen
Everybody got a thing but I guess mine isn't, with my vision
So I just sits in my Lamborghini, let my top vibe with me
Kick back and get high with me
And if she still get me
I hope my wife know she got a player for life and that's no bullshit
I push love to it's full limit
Do a 190 in a lane called memory
And I know you in that lane with me
But when the light changed you didn't change with it
And now I'm honking my horn
Got to get that dead grass off of my lawn
Yeah, as I mows on, the champagne's never frozen, as it pours on the floor

Drive bricks an book flights

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks
Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found

We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up

I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'mma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis


I run the streets cause I'm real if it's daylight or dark
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'mma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga


Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

Boy, look

Nigga - we put holes in you bitch-ass niggas, ya heard me
We don't barrow nothin', don't fear nothin'
Let 'em burn, nigga
Let 'em burn, nigga
B.Geezy, Lil Wheezy, Juvy, Two Tymer



Have your body shakin like in clay



And I'm ridin' wit a body on the shotty
Stretch a nigga out like Pilates
Catch a nigga outside his hidey
Snatch all the honey from your honey comb, now the bees keep flyin' by me
I'm on that piff that pody
That shit, smokin' like Vladi, spendin' dough from the 90's
Shinin', P-90, in the liming
I'm timing, don't time me mu'fucka

I'm a, young ass piranha
Don't get caught in that water cause I'm waitin' for a drowner
And on the corner I got packs on the counter
Before ya bitch leave I make Young Mob count em
Tryin' to get a dollar i could turn into a thousand
I'm so determined its a economic problem, drama
That's why I carry the llama
Ready at any given day to bury my honor
Love weed so much i tried to marry Juana
So pass the pastrami and asparagus mama, I'm watchin'
Cause in my area
If you got bread you better break it off share in here
I got his ankles, and his stereo
Cause i could get a cool buck fifty for that and the body yo, that's Hollygrove
It's Hollygrove til I adios
I gotta go, gotta go, got more bags to dope, yeah

I've been woundin, I've been waitin for you

Pain, since I've lost you I'm lost too
Nigga feelin like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'll do anythin for a part two, art too
Be friends with her, then you come back to me sayin that you forgive me
Gimme another chance I'm needin it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
But I fucked, I know I fucked up
I admit I fucked up, but everybody fuck up
Now this another nigga locked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause I be from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gansta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster, BANG

You've been brave, never lettin it show
But there's somethin that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everythin, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star and the sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give back my girl then you give me back my life
Give back my girl then you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin she be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

You've been brave, never lettin it show
Always tryin to keep it under control
You got it now, and weather your way to the top

You know, I see you hidin it mama
But I know you know
I know you do
But I wish you and yours nothin but happiness shorty

But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin room watchin Sportscenter
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings harder than delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma you even went and got a tan drop like me
I remember we was in that home all day
You called me "Butter" I called you "Bay"
My mama asked about ya, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say please don't worry about the women I've been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, DAMN

I've been woundin, I've been waitin for you
Am pretendin, and that's all I can do
The love am sendin ain't makin it through to your heart

Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive

I tell 'em no lie
I blow by in the Benz wit the O eyes
I low-ride, cuz these 20 inch rims just make it so hot
You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for
It's such a small car, but cost more than a ballpark
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling
My ice is like Andrew Dice "Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing"
You'll probably see me flying in a Lamborghini
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini
Cut the music down and tell her, "hey ya man's a weenie"
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie
And I'm just a teenager and I make this dough
Pull out my bankcard and Bill Gates feel broke
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal

Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive

You know me, pistol on my side fully loaded
I drive slowly, wit televisions watching Kobe
Pull over by some broad; make her hop right in a blow me
And suck a nigga drive, then its, "slut get out my ride"
Have you heard about, shorty be Iceberged out
Got them birds real affordable, so get the word out
And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop
I'm thuggin and pimped out, flossin and glissed out
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm thawin my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag
Shhh, You hear that, here come Weezy on his way in a platinum leer jet
We gamblin' nigga bet, bet nigga disrespect and he get dampled and wet
Whole goddamn family get trampled wit that

Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive

Alright I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover
Just put TV's and bump in the Rover
Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick is just bogus
Fuck a ho watch she come back like a chorus
Like one named Deloris met her in a taurus
She like to snort coke, you should see the size her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention
All our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common
Cuz everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'
The shit is mind blowin'
As a matter of fact I got a bitch that's mind blowin'
She give my head a blow job, I guess she's mind blowin'

Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump

Ayo Tim, I like this

Check it

My reality is bigger than your dreams are
Got your dream girl riding in your dream car
She wants me, she wants me
Plus I got it all
Bitch tell me what you don't see

I got 25 lighters on my dresser
Got the girl and a girl to undress her
My guitar strap is leather
My life is better than ever
I got women all up in my condo
And my drug dealer comes pronto
Got a registered pistol in the console
So, so, don't try me now

Yeah just riding feeling lovely
You can hate but your girlfriend loves me
Yeah I'm too G like a Gucci belt
Hot Gudda baby girl, I can make your coochie melt
I keep your lady wet like she took a dip
And if you looking for her, you can follow the drip
I'm slick like Rick, the ladies pulling my wrist
I just walk in the spot and out with my pick
I'm gone like a trip with a nice thick redbone
On the phone getting head, call it headphone
Pimping all over like Ludacris
These hoes love me, I'm wanted like a fugitive


What do you not see? You must be blind


What you need, contacts?
Tell me what you don’t see
What you can’t tell, I’m everything that he won’t be
Talking about your boyfriend, bitch you need a man friend
Even when you ain’t sittin' down you can’t stand him
Dirty dick bandit, luxury car whipper
Crib on Dolphin Island, backyard full of flippers
This is my reality, your man just be dreamin’
Wake up in the morning, bedsheets full of semen
I mean he’s wet dreaming, while me I really do it
Coulda, shoulda, woulda, baby girl you shoulda knew it
And fuck the paparazzi, I don’t ever kiss and tell
I’ll be your genie out the lamp or your wishing well
I’ll be your fishing pail and you can be my yacht buddy
Take you from A-Z, I’ll connect the dots hunny
Day viewers got money, baby cause I got money
I like it the B-5050, what you got for me?
It could be some bread, nah it ain’t gotta be cash
I’ll take a little head or I’ll take a lotta ass
I’ll take a friend or two, we can have a 3D weedy
I could toss you a Gudda Gudda or Lil Weezy, Weezy
Or my nigga Peedy Weedy, or my nigga Tity Tity
Fuck you on the hood of red strip and green Lamborghini
Go head and take this x-pill, that there buck you up
Probably have you walking round like “Damn, what the fuck”
Lady in streets but in the sheets girl you such a slut
Smash you on a top bunk, that’s a banger uppercut
And everyday we do brunch, everyday we do lunch
You do me, I do you
Baby we could do us and I ain’t gotta say no more
I don’t talk too much
Thus far, phew I feel like I’ve been trying to sell a car
Is you buying?

Haa, cause I ain’t got no time for a test drive
Do you want to go with me to the final frontier?
Don’t you see, I have everything but fear
This is not a dream, no this is real



Young, Young Mula baby
We got London on da Track
Boolin' at the basketball game
Dropped a hundred on the whole thing

Hate me, like or hate, ladies man like bait
Hop inside a Bentley with a red paper plate
Every time they hate I throw them bands like a bouquet
I ain't Ray J but you can be my Kim K
Feelin' like the flippin' leather green on, like a cape
I'll never believe what Lil Kim say
Walking like Phelps and you can jump in my lake
Running to my head like a deal in this league
Man, everywhere she go, she ballin'
Yeah she got xans, she like, „Where Tar at?"
She don't gangbang, she say she bang gangs
And she'll fight, might knock 'em at the ref
Out of cold Pepsi, she'll whip it like a waiter
I just wanna nut, she say that look just like a bagel
She just want a nigga, I don't serve but I love maple
And that's why she gon' watch me like cable ey

Bought a castle with my last deal

Lil nigga you laaaaaaaaate, okay

Ice inside my ring, you can skate
Yeah this shit cold like a case
That a nigga went and snitched, dealing with
All these mothafuckin' bitch
I'm the shit, hell I'm the shit I'ma
Build a hole for a snitch, not a ditch
They be hatin' on my girl, though
And they wish they was the bitch they're hatin'
Salutations to my old hoes
And thank you for your participation
No chaser for my girl though
She go harder than me on occasion
Gettin' wasted with my girl
Then we 69 'til we need ventilation
You don't know about it, gotta open new accounts
'Cause the others overcrowded
Gotta open up the stores when they're closed when we shoppin'
For my girl, wear the clothes that ain't nobody rockin'
She so bad, I don't know what to do with her
I know just what to do in her
Homies hit me up, they said they're goin' out tonight
I said I'm with my girl, tonight I can't fuck with you niggas
Don't get scared now pussy nigga
If I don't do nothin' in the world, swear to God I'm takin' kare of her
Take kare of lil mama, take kare of baby mama

I'll kill on the battlefield
Steal for the scrill
I will never leave my clique nigga, I'm to trill
I'm a little peepsqueal
But I'm a ape in that jungle
And if you get it twisted
Nigga, I'm taking yo lover
I mean I'm raping yo lover
Leave her taste in my rubber
I'm a playa nigga, I'm a playa




Yeah, this here some raw shit
KG, Rozay, Tunechi
Timbaland, that beat sick nigga


Nigga, it's Tunechi Lee
I B.E.T. your bitch tune in to me on BET
She know I got cribs, like MTV
Stuntin' like I'm Evil Knievel, got whips, MTB
YMCMB, kids got IANHB on their iPod
My C.I.R.C.L.E. full of bosses, no COB
Killin' all these niggas, gettin' the package, no COD
I'm like a fat bitch, who wanna fuck with me
Nigga I kill that pussy, OJ Simspon
Where I come from muthafuckas found upside down for Jordans and Pippens
I rock hoes like Jay, Weezy big pimpin'
Sleep is the cousin of death, so I can't sleep
Y'all bitching, I got an itchy trigger finger
I'm like Fifty, don't push me nigga
Got Buzz like Google, more buzz than Buzz Lightyear
You wanna? Nigga I'll get it on right here


14 years old when a nigga got his starter kit
Now a nigga levae the dealership without a whip
Philly blunts, Olympic torches gettin' lit
Mind on my money, million dollar investments
Trappin' since the beginning, Feds finna raid my crib for assessment
Crib cost 8 figures, no love for bitch niggas
Jeremy Scott, kick game Tommy Hilfiger
Hell awaits, Lord said one shall not kill niggas


Careful with evry move, but I don't care
New shipment, clost full of Trukfit and Nike Airs
All this syrup, my bitches make me pancakes
You know me, but you don't know what it takes
Callin' me a fuck nigga, look at the man in the mirror
Water vapor, you can't see me
I don't let em' be, these niggas wanna be me
I'mma Blood and they C's, like 2Pac you can't see me
It beats me why y'all wanna beat me
While y'all faggots beatin' off I beat it up, Ali bomaye
Finna finsih these niggas, fake G's
Pitbull ain't got that Heat, I'm reppin' New Orleans
Fuck these niggas, my team on that lean
Lean back, to these niggas we the Terror Squad
Shit, I'mma bastard like Ason
My niggas chain smokers, who wanna get they smoke one?


YMCMB in control, and with MMG we unstoppable
Invincible, my nigga there ain't no convincin' me
Took control of my own fate, I ain't ever goin' broke
Smile on my face, but the game no joke
Fuckin' crackers, they don't know
Drug dealers and real killers
Rich niggas, bitch niggas
Carjackers, robbin' from our own mothers
Lookin' up to our big brothers, the ones who made it out
Drug rings, Feds tryna shut us down
Cock the Glock for any nigga tryna shoot me down
Killer instincts, my team hold it down
Always on my grind, you'll never hold me down
Front on me, and pay the price
KG the well known asshole, feling like my nigga Obie Trice
Shit, I can't go to jail tonight


From day one, I knew I'd make it one day
Always gettin' cake, everyday my birthday
Went from an underground king like UGK, to the throne
Niggas watchin me, like Jay and Kanye
No church in the wild, no faith in the hood
Engine roaring, V12 under the hood
Bitch niggas run when they see me in the hood, Usain Bolt
You a bunch of shook ones, each one of my words a jolt


Kingpin, crimnal mastermind
God Forgives and I Don't, hopes lookin' out for MasterMind
Six figure bullet numbers, don't cross the line
You claim to be a true G, you only tough online

Yeah, oh, hold up, oh
Bring it back, bring it back *record spins back*
Yeah, Hot spitta
Yeah, Chick snatcher
YM, young and sexy

We just a bunch of young niggas with dough
So we leaving with her and you'll be leaving alone
Young Money nigga

Since I'm the best, I walk with extra gestures
Lead on my hip for the textbook testers

The seats don't fold, baby girl this the floor
Ugh, baby girl this the boy
I please a lot of ladies
So please say the, please say the
She say the baby

My girl from Belize, she never wanna believe

Love how I get ill when I get real street
Like bushwick bill bitch gimme three feet

And if you do, I don't blame ya

Just can't help this fetish we got, for fuckin other niggas hoes
They recognize us wherever we go
So it's easy for us to get em up out of they clothes
Come on homie you know how it goes
You just respect the fact that we the niggas she chose
We just a bunch of young niggas with dough
So we leaving with her and you'll be leaving alone
Young Money nigga

Rest in Peace Soulja Slim









Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Weez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicodins, Valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'mma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

Nigga, y'all gon' respect Weezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', "Stop!"
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than "The Three Lil Pigs'" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Weezy Wee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

Tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'mma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

Look

Right where you standing that's where you gone lay
Still play it cool, get off the streets
Cops came to the house, moms told them I was sleep
Cause she memorized the script to a tee
Told them that I had the flu and I was in the bed for weeks

Got your family running asking people have they heard of ya
All over, putting up posters
Like you got an album about to drop
But there ain't nothing bout to drop but that casket
Label me a bastard even though I know my pops, yeah

From these hating ass niggas and these crooked ass cops
Fuck it, it just make me grind harder
Now I'm signed to young Carter

Benchwarmers getting mad, I'm a starter

Talk big shit and still turn bricks like back flips
Young Money be the circle that I ride fo'
Nigga we live to stay fly on you ass holes

But I got so much love for the south
Where the women be most thick and give great mouth
And love all the shit that a thug be 'bout
Now let these things ling out
YM bitch, now it's time to bang out

Gorilla with the flow, nigga finna blow
Ice everywhere, chinchilla to the flo'
Escalade trucks with the chromed out buggy
Type of shit I got since the nigga got paid
Nigga gained a little weight but the hoes still love me
Still let a nigga put the dick to they face
Run up in your crib, put the burner to your face
Leave the scene with out a trace at a earn hard pace
But no I ain't bail, I ain't tryna hit the wall
Tryna mack a little broad and get her back to the place
Yo man trip, I show 'em what the Ruger hold
Catch a flight to Jayville, can't miss the Super Bowl
Then it's back to the hood cause I love the streets
Better find Noah's Ark, bout to flood the streets
Young Money, that's the clan
Young Maine, I'm the man
Getting money is the plan
The Rugers don't jam

Weezy F. kinda nice with the Glock
But I'm better than that with the rock
Tryna land me a spot at the Roc
And my city got word of that
Niggas want me to hook them up with Fox

Got the bullets coming out the pump
Running through your stomach back like a Running Back

I come from under that rock and turned into a pebble
Baby I'm trouble, so turn up the treble
You say it's clever, I call it whatever



That’s not love
That’s not love
That’s not love

Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth cosed, you wanna know why you die
The answer’s right under your nose
Exposed to the street, in the game I don’t cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I get money, don’t shit come free
It’s my life and I run it even when
Keep my business in my pockets, don’t wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
See…


Say what’s on your heart if you’re real
Cause the scars you can’t see be the hardest to heal
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought
Cause you can only chase something that you haven’t caught
If there’s a summertime in hell, it’s not as hot
You empty clip niggas ain't got a shot
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
Now you decide if their to die for
Advice to my haters, do what I say now
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
Thought it was love, how foolish of us
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother


Look, as the crooked World revolves
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live
And when death comes you better have lives to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas is snitching and still living
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches
Niggas pretend like they actually in
But when it go down they fuck around and be them
That blood look familiar when it’s leaking
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga
That ain't love


Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!
I see these haters in passing, yeah they ’round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist
Just anothger page in my success story
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me




I can't fuck with ho niggas
I can't trust these hoes neither
Wake up early in the morning
Eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hater ass niggas be baller blocking
Acting like some goalkeepers
There's a reason for everything but
My niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with the ho beater
All-black hoodie, I'm Grim Reaper
Look like its time for spring cleaning
Brand new spanking street-sweeper
Been in the game, I'm knee-deep
I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready
Got a chopper with a drum
Split Swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump
Double barrel on that pump
This kush I got ain't no chump
Get stupid and get stomped
Two girls I call criss Kross
Kriss Kross'll make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do
Got goons I ain't even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool
I like my bitches in twos
Gotta go, I stick it and move
Last night I got so high
I Swear to God, I went to the moon
I want that shit you can't get no where
You pussy boy, don't go there
If I don't do nothing, I'mma ball
No hair. Smoking on that "oh yeah"
My niggas tote that hardware
What you bout woadie?
My niggas about that warfare
Real nigga since day one
Cause I ain't promised day two
Throw that pussy at me
Bitch, I think I'm Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way
Yeah that's that new Landaulet
She hit me with her jungle
I'm gonna hit her with that rattle snake
Guns clap like patty cake
Blood gang red bandana face
Make them p-ssies pop theyself
You can call that "masturbate"
I don't front no fabricate
I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F Baby bitch
The F is for Fascinate
Louisiana from that swamp
I'mma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump
Fuck you and where you from
I ball 24/7, 3 6 5, 12 months
Put some redbone, put some caramel
Come to Wayne's World, it's a fairy tale
Yeah I'm high bitch, bitch I para-sail
Carter 4 is late, sorry for the wait

Heavenly Father, creator of all things
I humble myself, as I bow to your throne
Heavenly Father

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord

Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son needs
I try and live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder, will I lose control of the Maserati
And hit some tree, just being young me?
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, 'cause I'd take over
I feel it approachin' but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord

Yeah, and everytime I see the sun shine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the frontline
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah, I made my bed right
So when I do I should sleep tight

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord

Bury me a gangster 'cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breathe of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that owner
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so I just gotta make my way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord

Creator of all things
I humble myself, as I bow to your throne
Heavenly Father

And police don't even matter, they can suck what
Tha price right if I catch ya slippin', nigga, what what.. what


Eeh, what, what

Lil' boy, I got so much money, I know who killed Kennedy
I hear you tellin' people 'bout tha people you done
But look, everytime I bump into to ya, you all about fun
What made you bring a knife to a gun fight... now that's not right!
Why your bitch-ass even showed up tonight?
Nigga, we use ta kick it like Tai Bo
I don't know.. what made you go sideshow, turn jive whore
Kickin', trifling, dirty, and low
We use ta split chicken.. ride ta Texas and back
I drive tha rental car while you drive tha Cadillac
Shakin' like a pair of hot dice
Doin' 55, duckin' feds, law enforcements, and police
Niggas turn like fake gold.. sell they soul
9-karat 44's, and Calicos
Keep a clean nose
And tight Teflon bullet-proof clothes


Nigga outta line, get smoked

Fuckin' with my B.G., off top I'm goin' broke
I don't play with these niggas

And have niggas' brains coverin' tha ground
I'm tha number-one stunter, you don't want my trouble
I'll have four niggas in your hood in my hummer

Ya get a whole thing for ten, nigga, tha price tha same

My money long, within the runway at a airport
I just bought a Hotel Cash Money Resort
Hoes love my grill, hoes love my crib

These hoes just love tha way that.. Baby live

But I'm a thug-ass nigga, arms full of some tats
Got a Cash Money Millionaires 'cross my back
You don't want funk with me.. I don't think you do, nigga

We'll put ten-a-piece on your whole crew

Niggas pop shit, always talkin' 'bout somethin'
See ya' ass in public, it's a whole 'nother subject
Man they just talk about it, they just talkin bout it
And I'm on the streets with it, I'm on the streets with it
See where I come from you got to be about it
And if you want it want it, we come and see about it

Okay, uhh

Then I'm rollin' up my window, fuck 'em





Now listen...lemme preach to 'em
Lemme show 'em why..w-w-what it take...
I ain't gonna say why I'm better than others
'couse i ain't better than nobody, actually
But lemme show 'em why I'm a lot different from everybody else
Because...and what I mean by everybody else I mean everybody else that does what we does
You know, this recordin' industry, music, thing
What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice
I don't do that
What I do is, I go to studio
And I just stay in the studio
See you have to understand the difference

The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job
To me, this is my life
The club; that's my job
The mall; that's my job
Your neighborhood; that's my job
This studio; this is my life
This is what I do better than anything
So why wouldn't I do this all the time?
See that's the difference between you and I
You get money and you get crazy
I get crazy and I get money
And the biggest difference between you and I is...
You love me and I hate you



There is no peace
I ride 'till is not wheels
Till there is no streets
Like where is my piece
They dying in them cells or already dead
Or tryna kill themselves
I rep my niggas, I love my city
I feel myself and she feel my wealth
So it will not help, I gotta get me
And money like pussy and I gotta get deep
So I gotta get street cause it's riding on me
My niggas can't drive, I got riders with me
And nah I ain't in to that back and forth chit chat
As a matter fact I'mma end that...
Prone to destruction, home is corrupting
Stones in my dungies won't do the justice
Them hundred dollar homes is in abundance
Hustle on a mountain, hustle in a tundra
Get that money or don't function
Punctuation exclamation exclamation period
That's the way I have to make it
S to K, you better take it, idiots period
Bull shit, I pity it
Them guns shot so loud you would think I MIDI'd it
I shot more than once, I'm ab-libing it
Oh well you been in hell so what, I live in it
I'm giving it all, I got for them incentives
Riding for them benefits and now it's back to 10 a brick
I like 'em thin and thick
Really I like 'em thick, high yellow and shit
Weezy F Baby

What?
What?!
Look-
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real gutta like bad bowls
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?


I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

Look
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'mma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Weezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me unattatched without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
Who? Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga

I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
Cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Weezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who want this Weezy, nigga? Who want this Weezy, nigga?
Weezy, nigga; Lil Weezy, nigga

Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all

It's Weezy, nigga - Lil Weezy, nigga
Don't tangle it, nigga
It's time to step down, ya heards me



Weed and syrup
Yeah
Who we is?
Young Mula baby
Got that right shawty
Big D on the track
Yeah
I’m just staring at the world from a Cadillac window baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don’t act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I’m ready to perform and she’s gon’ be my audience
Girl I’m really big on you, so what you wan’ do?
Too fly, you need a parachute
Ohh, but that just means you’re falling inlove…
In love with a skater
Five, six, seven, man I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when shegave me a hug, yeah
Shawty got me open, pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Uh, where your mans at? Remember melike this one time in band camp, yeahh
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Heyyy, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine then I drink a tall glass
Girl you gon’ make me take ya to your desired destination
Left leg right leg, segregation, aha
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that’s my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I’m there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like it stole somethin’, haha
Cause she so fine, yeah, from the front, from the side, from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I’mma fuck you till you wine
Young Mula baby
Young Mula baby
And everything is all wrong
Everything is alright
Everything is alright



Hoops, cars, big trucks
These are a few of are favorite things, yeah!

I'm live with the toast dude I'm liable to approach you
Like hi, then bye and I will just roast you
My dudes all the same here, we shoot off and bang here
Red dot your nose like you was Rudolph the Reindeer
I'm fast when I race cars, I smash and I scrape cars
I'm a mack and I play hard
Like hey ya hey ma open ya mouth wide put your head down there
Respect me I'm a pimp 'round here
Our doors go up on our whips round here
We drive


Weezy fucking baby nigga
Pardon me I'm stunting, Tha Carter, yeah I'm young and
Audemars runnin off body temperatures look at you
Looking all shook up, I'm a fly nigga rock my chain when I cook up
Evisu getting took up, Cavallis in the cleaners
Pirellis on the Beamer, I swear that bitch hotter than the bullets in the Nina
You talking to a fever, nigga get your heat up
And I'm a dirty south boy, nigga get your teet up
I hit like Roy not Jones but Williams
Finding me a Kelly make some destiny children
The recipe is Cristal and sizzurp
Call that Crizzurp, get that from Killer
Cam that's my man, and Juelz that's my nigga
Dip-dipset Young Money where the dessert?
Nah where the desert?
It's right up in that May', bitch, under that Corinthian leather
Holla back, nigga


Stash box in the car we hiding big blow
I ride more chrome, I rock more stones
I got 4 scones, and I ain't talking cookies nigga
'Til the day that you pass
I'm talking true facts, I'm talking true stacks
Coupes black, coupes that come with the roof back
That what we live for, get a grip ho
That how we stroll down here, that's how we roll down here
Spectacular chrome down here, that's how it go down here
Cause these are a few of our favorite things




Lyrics coming soon...



You only got a few days more
To get the guns you want at the gun store
On the first day of christmas guess what santa bring for me
A Glock a magnum & a rusty M3
Rom pom pom pom we don't want no rom pom pom pom

Welcome to hell I let em burn
Momma told me don't play with them choppas I never learn
I hold the tube tight & firm I don't squirm
Killas hold court in the street court is adjourned
These niggas sleepin hope they keep it in they napsack
Watch me while I'm creepin leave em leakin like a flap jack
Hustle all day like we eatin on the last stack
We play with ak's boy you need to bring that mac back
Hand gun, me no want no hand gun
Tote a shotty with a bass drum
Say somethin I'm from where them niggas can't come
We die rich & young
We die handsome and
Me I never ran from another man son
I take alot a shots bitch nigga and one
So throw away them Glocks
I hope they prayin for ya
You hear that chop now you sayin somethin, Nigga that's the


Murda she wrote nigga we loke
You can get smoked like brand new dope
Brand new scopes on old ass guns from brand new beef
If he play you cold you give him heat
Play that roll get in them streets
You pay that toll life ain't cheap
The streets is watchin
The streets can see what you can't see
You ain't safe, you ain't free
You jus a target with teeth
Ya'll niggas don't hear me
Shoot him in the eye make the nigga see clearly
Now he only got one eye like the pyramid
Bitch I'm in the game like the beer man, hear me
They on my grass shoot 'em down like a deer man
Down down baby goin down like airtran
Yeah & you don't wanna take it there man
Because I'm already there man
I'm sayin


Survival of the fittest
It is well known there's no water like my city's
Some of us are killers some of them are jus swimmers
Niggas got choppas niggas got trimmers
Niggas got problems niggas got business
Niggas got children niggas got bitches
Bitches got bitches
I know bitches realer then you
Nigga I done seen keys bigger then you
Yeah nigga you ain't on shit
Cut off a nigga head make him suck his own dick
No he don't want that & he don't want this
I shoot a hundred times I be blind if I miss
You know I gotta put the dollar sign before the bitch
Every movie gotta end but I'm just stickin to the script
Addicted to the chips commited to my clique
Cash money mother fucker get the pistol to your lips




When I would think about retiring
Uhh...I look at retirement like, I look at retiring like
You retire out when you die out
Straight up, cause you never retire out what you do
You never retire out of what you do
Meaning, if you put so much into--if what you do is your life, like mine
You know what I mean like, my career is my life
So I could never retire out, even when I stop rapping
I'm going to still be in some kind way or form or fashion in it
You know what I mean like
When I die there's going to be rappers at my funeral, hopefully
You know what I mean
But, you know what I mean that's just how it is
Or, y'all gonna remember that that was a rapper
But hopefully, I'll go down known for something different--
Not different, but known for something else also, you know what I mean
But that's what I'm going to do, hopefully
I know what I'm going to do, I'm that nigga man

Lil Wayne
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven’s right above it
We onnnn
'Cause we onnnn

Drake
Who else really tryna mess with Hollywood Cole? I’m with Marley G, bro
Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know
This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow
And uh, my real friends never hearin' from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That’s why I pick and choose, I don't get stuff confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the dance club and all them girls find me
Plus I been sippin', so this stuff is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Lil Wayne
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on
It's Young Money
If you ain't runnin' wit it, run from it, all right

Now somebody show some money in this club
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this club, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a darn, X Games
Guns turn you boys into madmen
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you people know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the aeroplane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the flowers
You men can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on
It's Young Money
If you ain't runnin' wit it, run from it, all right

Now somebody show some money in this club
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this club, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Uh, how do he say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that girl look better red
Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg
Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you people in apartments
No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor
Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Dang, where you stumbled out? From where they make gumbo at
Kane got the beat jumpin' like a jumping jack
But you know me, I get on this track and have a heart attack
Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, man, nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on
It's Young Money
If you ain't runnin' wit it, run from it, all right

Now somebody show some money in this club
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first



Ah, young Nino, fuck a bitch in a pea coat
Carlito, Scarface, Al Pacino
Bun B though, Pimp C, R.I.P though
I goes deep in that pussy, Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, fuck her to my own single
Break a bitch heart, no future Miss Cleo
Snapback, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a fucking beetle, you can't beat 'em
Vampire fuck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don't believe it, stripe like A-fucking-didas
The gun Selena, give a nigga Bieber fever
Real fucking hot, put it in park take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You's a bop, give me top top, as I load the guap

Fuck is up, nigga's stomping in my Chucks
Yeah I make it reindeer, cause I'm all about my bucks
Use the butt up in the front, dick up in her cunt
And I put it in her hole, hole in one, putt putt ergh
S-Super McNasty, why you McLovin
When the bitch call me daddy
Pimp, no Caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog, called the bitch Lassie
Young savvy, bang her like Cincinnati
Above average, f-fly like I'm Aladdin
They bend backwards, th-throw the pussy at them
I'm Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket
Balls in the air, no games, I'm serious, double dare
There's too many bitches, why these niggas wanna stare
Pat Ron up in here, nigga this ain't no beer

Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, Magic Johnson
My motherfucking doctor said I need a doctor
So I called House, now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinny's, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she won't get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon, I'm fucking Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, sen' me naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call that nigga Richard
Prior to me coming, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can't beat it, join it
Tunechi, coochie, that what she call it
Flag scarlet, I killed it, mournin'

You only got a few days more
To get the guns you want at the gun store
On the first day of Christmas, Guess what Santa bring for me
A Glock, a magnum, a rusty M3

Rappapompom, we don't want no rom pom pom pom

Welcome to hell I let em burn
Momma told me don't play with them choppas, I never learn
I hold the tube tight & firm I don't squirm
Killers hold court in the street court is adjourned
These niggas sleeping, hope they keep it in they knapsack
Watch me while I'm creepin leave em leakin like a flap jack
Hustle all day like we eatin on the last stack
We play with ak's boy you need to bring that mac back
Hand gun they don't want no hand gun
Tote a shotty with a bass drum
Say something, I'm from where them niggas can't come
We die rich & young
We die handsome and
Me I never ran from another man son
I take alot a shots, bitch nigga and one
So throw away them Glocks
I hope they prayin for ya
You hear that chop now you sayin somethin

You only got a few days more
To get the guns you want at the gun store
On the first day of Christmas, Guess what Santa bring for me
A Glock, a magnum, a rusty M3

Rappapompom, we don't want no rom pom pom pom

Murda she wrote nigga we loke
You can get smoked like brand new dope
Brand new scopes on old ass guns from brand new beef
If he play you cold you give him heat
Play that roll get in them streets
You pay that toll life ain't cheap
The streets is watchin
The streets can see what you can't see
You ain't safe, you ain't free
You just a target with teeth
Ya'll niggas don't hear me
Shoot him in the eye make the nigga see clearly
Now he only got one eye like the pyramid
Bitch, I'm in the game like the beer man, hear me

Down down baby goin' down like airtran

Because I'm already there man

You only got a few days more
To get the guns you want at the gun store

Survival of the fittest it is well known there's no water like my city's
Some of us are killers some of them are jus swimmers
Niggas got choppas niggas got trimmers
Niggas got problems niggas got business
Niggas got children niggas got bitches
Bitches got bitches
I know bitches realer then you
Nigga I done seen keys bigger then you
Yeah nigga you ain't on shit
Cut off a nigga head make him suck his own dick
No he don't want that & he don't want this
I shoot a hundred times I be blind if I miss
You know I gotta put the dollar sign before the bitch
Every movie gotta end but I'm just stickin to the script
Addicted to the chips commited to my clique
Cash money mother fucker get the pistol to your lips

You only got a few days more
To get the guns you want at the gun store
On the first day of Christmas, Guess what Santa bring for me
A Glock, a magnum, a rusty M3

Rappapompom, we don't want no rom pom pom pom



Y, colorful like Chapel paint
You hapless fakes should know I'm the master bate
Keep spitin' till my lips bleed
Bury you 6 feet, got your girl fist deep
Your shit's weak, Ripley says mines risky
I take the stick out her mouth, just to let my chick breath
This'll make you spend your rainy day savings
I radiate rabis and I'd maybe date Brady's wife
She's a Brazilian baby from the 80's
Maybe be my lady, spit crazy and amazing
Lately, I been blazing cause I'm sicker than the chicken pox
Hit you with a Sunny Liston shot when the whistle stops
You write simple plots, mine are outlandish
I got a gifted cock, girls say its outstanding, yes-
I'm moving forwards while you stay stuck in sleet
I got a bunch of needs, S.May cut the beat
I'll run this game even if you cuff my feet
Fans love the heat so viewers be like "fuck a beat"
I'm just a beast who will punch a G till his stomach bleeds
Gut check, tough set when your something's weak
Since puberty, weed has been a cash crop
Mad hops on the black top you work the snack shop
The definition of sloppy, ask Webster
Pay attention you copies, I roll the best herb
My brain is lifted, your plagiarism not fresher
Than me throwing 1 down as a catcher
Worship the wordsmith you're worthless and nervous
Surfing the surface with a surplus of servants
Look- I require your undivided attention
Around me don't mention, affection or prevention
Rapin' beats raw dog, like the cats in straw dogs
Hard bars, spit flame like Charzard
I smoke Ivysoar till my eyes are sore, buy some more
Fuck the rental house, I'm coming through to buy the whole block
No need your temper down, you know we 'bout to party non-stop
You try to rap but you chop, callin' fouls but you flop
If this is Famersville you're the pussy beggin' for crops
You a bottom feeder, Spongebob is your next door neighbor
Easy haters, save it for later, I'm your father Darth Vader
That's a joke invader Zim, I already run the world
No need to say it again, no need to say it again
You see I spit rhymes and dish dimes like my name's Steve Nash
You see I clip mine from the beanstalk, I don't spend no cash
I just watch that ass, as your bitch is cooking breakfast
I'm sexting her best friend, telling' me "wear no protection"
She molested my mind, went on the Maury show to prove it ain't mine
Smokin' blunts all the time, or maybe spliff bowls or papers
Bow to your creator, no time for the bullshit
I'm out I'll see you later, I'm the man like Slater
Getting' pussy and your mascot is the masterbaters
You mad cause I stained her, you a little bitch so you stayed there
I'm the dog trainer, better yet call me the Whisperer
She's suckin' on my dick, and I ain't kiss her
I'm a baller, stackin' money like Griffin off the Clippers
Your a weird mother fucker lookin' for dragons and wizards
Fag well we figured, no need to stop at the bank
I get my money delivered in the same truck as my dank



Fo' fo' bulldog, my my pack
I point it at you and tell it fetch
I'm fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call it triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset ? dick in the world and nigga I ain't ? yet!
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep so Weezy can't rest
An AK47 is my fucking address, huh

I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car

Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them where it hurts
Cause if I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Big black, and an icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, that got a Nike shop
Counts the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick em off they might high, swish!
I'm swimming in the yellow, boss
In the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop ?
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected I got killers in Chicago

I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car


Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them where it hurts
Cause if I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I'm red fox
Big bee's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, big clocks
Your fucking with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Empty the clip than roll a window up
Swe-swe-swe-sweet, center bun
I'm in a red, she said she
200 thou on a chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let ya ? speak
Dark shades, Eazy E
Five letters, YMCMB
Fuck that Nigga, fuck that nigga
I see ya looking, what ya looking at nigga
You know the rules, kill em all and keep moving
If I died today it'd be a holiday

I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
So don't make it come alive
Rip ya apart than I put myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, pocket gain and 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, than I made a great escape
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm santa claus
Niggas gather round, I got gifts for all of y'all
Take it home and let it bubble thats the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It's a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, muthaf-ck huddle up

I'm not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
Yeah

Yes it's Lil Wayne but the moneys enlarged
Priorities Young Money and God
Now they want to know how I be getting money on Mars
Cause I be getting paid like outta this world
Hip hop is a bitch and I'm proud of this girl
But when the sharks come see the fish curl
This is my game you gone need a referral
I know more bout tree then squirrel
We dont talk much but that heat so verbal
Brand new Marc Jacobs peak color thermal
Gun outside of the gear, external
Im so fly, yall still at the terminal
I put you in the dirt, just because I see the worm in ya
Dirty South bitch, admire and acknowledge it
&& respect my conglomorate!

Walkin' around lookin' for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
A labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walkin' in bampers
Give me a cigarette
Smokin' my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

I'm Lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
& I'm swervin'
On & off the road
I'm Lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin' in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is about to bust

I think I'm losin' it
I might be losin' it
I just might lose
Am I losin' my mind?
& I'm so confused I don't know what to do
& I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind

I call up my girlfriend
She doesn't answer
I hit the strip club & fuck wit a dancer
Throwin' my one's up
I go pay in ransom
Told me I look good
She said I was handsome
So I believed her
'Cause I am lonely
I'm just a loner
My life is a movie
Tonight we're just actors
& this is a sin comes
So Tell me you love me
Tell me I'll get some

I'm Lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
& I'm swervin'
On & off the road
I'm Lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin' in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is about to bust

I think I'm losin' it
I might be losin' it
I just might lose
Am I losin' my mind?
& I'm so confused I don't know what to do
& I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Am I losin' it?
Am I losin' it?
I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind

I'm makin' this money
Just to go spend it
Livin' the good life
Hope nobody ends it
But who are you kiddin'?
Hey who are you lyin' to?
You know if they want you
Best believe they will find you

I'm Lost on a road
& there's no one to talk to
There's nowhere to run to
I'm goin' in circles
I'm talkin' to myself
It Got me blazin' this purple

I think I'm losin' it
I might be losin' it
I just might lose
Am I losin' my mind?
& I'm so confused I don't know what to do
& I need a clue before I run out of time

I think I'm losin'
I'm losin' my mind

I'm Lost on a road

I'm Lost on a road

I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
& I'm swervin'
On & off the road

I'm losing my mind

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That’s why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole

Meet me on the fresh train

And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it

Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg
Ma'fuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor
Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled out? From where they make gumbo at
Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack
But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on
It's Young Money, motherfucker
If you ain't runnin' wit it, run from it, motherfucker, all right

Now somebody show some money in this bitch
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Chopper knock your face off
Black shades, Ray Charles

She grab that d*ck with 2 hands

Clips hanging, no curfew

I'm shining like church shoes
I'm bout it... I said I'm about to cum
When I'm on the scene I'm on that lean
B*tch, I'm drowsy
Man, I'm so high I don't know what I'm laughing about
I got bars, n*gga and it's happy hour!

Ridin' round with them choppas, not them ninas
Ridin' with a b*tch named Molly and she on Molly - ha!
Man these n*ggas can't see me like a diary

Smoke that weed, let's get eerie
Nina shut up, that b*tch got a silencer
Top of the gun there is a scope

Trukfit my b*tch up, Tunechi Li big nuts
I'm getting my d*ck sucked
I blow weed like it's dust!
Just bought my girl a Ferrari Spider
Told her drive it like it got 8 legs
No pussy no rats, no Tom and Jerry
They say your friends are your enemies?
Well, my friends are imaginary
I'm the motherf*ckin' resolution like the 1st of January
My ride cold and my b*tch hot
I'm tired as hell but my d*ck not
I don't gas no b*tch, no pitstop

My b*tch titties is poppin out
We poppin' up and we get it poppin'
Mask on, gloves on

Smoking on that sticky bag
Small feet, but I kick your ass
I'm the trigger man, and that shooting star
Eat that pussy like caviar
She treat that d*ck just like a straw
How you like them apples, Microsoft?
Now wipe it off
Step off in that motherf*cker fresher than some Certs
Uuh! Who the f*ck is Stevie J?
I got the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your ass, kill your ass
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed
Just make sure my pillow's fluffed
Hit a n*gga with a million shots
What you call that? A million bucks
Good weed, we pass around
It's Young Money, Cash Money
Til the motherf*ckin' day I'm cashin' out!
Tunechi!

Riding round with them choppas, not them ninas
Your b*tch wanna come over here where the grass is greener
And if you passing that weed, I'm the wide receiver

In my physical not including my dick and my gentitals
And I pop at you to confirm my criminal
One chief tribe I'm head Seminole
Carter's straight
I then ran through the Florida State
I got money, drugs, hoes in every part of the state
Miami hotter way ocean view will catch you
I bring sand to the beach and still build a castle, nigga
You turn hoes off I take those on
A magnum latex goes on the pace goes on
I take a bitch to a island you take a ho to the mall
I holler once and shake a ho to the alphasician

Kordell Stewart in ball conditions

Icey white sneaks ice is bright over the same black tee

And don't thinkI just think it
Hit a track and I stink it
You ain't met a nigga like me in while my type extinct, bitch

They calling my thoughts the Maxwell house so dark
Step up on the mound with no bark
Pedro Martinez with my mean ass
No matter how old a nigga

I Play That



Nigga I be hard on a ho cause a bitch ain't shit
And every ho I done fucked done sucked my dick
I had to pour out some drink for niggas I miss
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss
It's Dedication 5, medication high
I got to clean up after these niggas cause they be wasting time
And boy my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines
It's Tunechi
I go hard, I put in work
Twin clocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
You know snitches get stitches nigga needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't 2Pac or B.I.G
Alright fucking right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all yo possessions, call that shit poltergeist
And my homie he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plain Jane cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script
Your bitch leaking information, I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe, I'mma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like he-man when I'm in your ho
You tell that bitch give me my space like a telescope
In her throat like the cola, my system solar
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra
Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to god, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a universe
You better duck, like Dooney and Burke
I'm telling you, shot out Turk, it's Hot Boys, bitch the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success, I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea shit don't stop until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock
Tunechi
Dedication 5, what up five



Fresher than a mothafuckin cocaine pusher
Got work under the stairs, got the gun in the bushes
Anybody want beef, come and meet the butcher
Bring the punk out of a nigga like Ashton Kutcher
Fuck you pay me! like nasty hookers
I got that recipe they tell me pass the cook book
Fuckin wit lil weezy baby thats a good look
So hop your ass on the good book and sha mon'
I ain't really that nigga that you would want to front on
I put ya whole life on ya front lawn .. come on
Son on that shit that none on, gun on
I can drive the whip and work the tooly while with one arm
Thats word to my mom, she worry if I'ma come home
I tell her dont trip, I'm runnin this bitch, a nigga just gettin his stunt on
Number one stunner junior! hallelujah! fuck ya! I wish I never knew ya! PEACE!

I got a bird in the bag, and the bag on my back
Got a murder warrant in the magazine on my lap
Clear the scene!

Verse 2 Ransom
My hustle is gettin gully

You couldn't joust wit me, nigga there ain't no doubt wit me
You run your mouth to me, I go hang you over ya balcony
They got it out for me, dont gotta spell it out for me
Jersey boy, got the whole city that could vouch for me
Dont try to play homie ill pull the eighty out, fade ya out
Put what you was thinkin on ya lady blouse
This a great rookie, ransom, pray for me
Take a chance, put this ape on like a bapes hooded

Hand guns, bland one, go ahead, bleed to death

Chorus

Verse 3 Rick Ross

Triple c's, my people we triple g's, while you looking all crooked, my niggas they quick to squeeze!
Slap you with the four five, bitch who you rapping bout

Hey T, looks like we at the end of the O
Choppa 4 in a 20 ounce of Carter 24

And we sip on 24s
Head is sittin on a pair of gucci pennyloafs
Yea i get money fuck with bitches that get me more
Now, you know the game same shit different hoes

Who cut the ears and the tail off Mickey Mouse
Never been a rat never had him in the house
Call me captain kangaroo, i got money in my pouch
I don't mean loose change when I say money in the couch

Yea we put the drinks down we pick the two's up
You have a dude tripping? we hit dude up
You ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up

Target practice baby
Only thing is Im not the shooter I'm the bullet, Bitch!

Weezy fuckin' baby, get em a leash
Young Money, Dipset, you better believe
That gun got me walking like i got irregular knees
I be all over that bread like sesame seeds
Automatic with the money like reggie for 3
Big birds no sesame street
Bitch I'm too clean they ain't messing with me
I'm just tryna see my decimals peek
These niggas lighter than some vegetable meat
These niggas just sweet like a Tahitian treat
Ok they say I'm full of hot air then i release the heat
Spill a nigga from his teeth defeat
You know what im talking bout, you know what i mean?
Like kick the sneak
I go dollar for dollar, week for week
Yea birdman say you niggas is bitches

Fresh checkerboard Vans and a T-shirt
And it's going down but she first
My flow sweet, make my teeth hurt
I spit ice cream bars, that's dessert
To me there's no such thing as a G-1st
Yea, my feature price high like a mink purse
I smoke a whole reef of the reefer
Drugs are bad but I beg to defer, sir
I just take a look at her face
So she can see that
My shades are Versace and she purr
Cause I'm a cool cat per say
So I give her my life and now I got eight, word
She asked me to go over her place, I said sure
She said shes been horny all day, I got the cure
I'm on her like turf
Now bring that ass, bring that ass
Bring that ass hurr, ya digg?
I, I, I don't know that you been told
But I can tell you something 'bout me
I smoke weed, I drink and I roll
Now is you fucking with me
Now I can't tell you shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothing on me
Cause after a pill and half and a shot of Patrón
I'm a pussy MVP



Whats poppin'? Whaddup 5?
The problem with me is i believe in you too much
Whoo! Ya heard me? We in this bitch
Uh.. I dont really consider myself a living legend
Because uh... Sometimes legends arent true
So... And sometimes i dont even feel like im living
So... To answer the question about what it is to be a living legend
Uh! Honestly i wouldn't know
But what it is to be Lil Wayne; its amazin' its awesome
I wouldn't give it up for the world
Ya dig?



No one knows what it's like
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep and I'm stillmatic
The way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still
It's like tryin to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped just knowin any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if
Bush rapped I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money you can't pay me enough
You to play me
Is cock-a-mani you just ain't zany enough
To rock with shady
My noodle's cock-a-doodle
My clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose
Yeah the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor I'm numeral uno
If Assuming
There's no humor in it no more
You know I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need fag to come a tear a new whole in my ass
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind the lies
No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To telling lonely lies
Damn I ain't never kill nobody I promise
An I promise if you try me
You gone hafta to rewind this track
And make me go back that thing'll go 'lack''
That boy'll lay flat so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm an I'm masturbatin
Black peter pan fly till I die
Wat u sayin Bathe in ape
Eve Saint - evie sue what I stay & gat me feelin'
Like scarface light the cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four seater
You know I be high get right in the four seater
Top floor of the four seasons
Four of them whores
An they all know how to cook it up
An look I got some and only one know how ta bag
Bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world so homie bundle up
Clean on this grind full or not get your hustle up
To be the bad man
I'm dealing with some shit homie
It's in the back of my head
An it's some shit homie but I just rap it instead
See I got wolverines bones in me but
The whole worlds throwin stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a childs mother and I hate her to death
But that's my childs mother so that's my
Mate to the death it's wow how I love her for
For putting little me here
And me and her could be forever
She gonna still be there
Then it's some other niggas
I judged the character wrong but
They some other niggas
Now let's get back to the song
I gotta Drug Problem
That I ain't tending to, cause I gotta enough problems
An my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to Pcp and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately
But nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately
I'm sorta feeling repressed lately
So ya'll been hearin and seein me less lately
Like does anyone notice the regress lately
Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed alota regrets lately
Yeah
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do
An I blame you
No one fights back as hard on their anger
None of my pain in the world
Can show through



It's nothin', Prefix, go!
Bitch, my name is Weezy F Baby
And you wanna know what the F is for?
That's cause I stay fresh, I I stay fresh

My name is Weezy F Baby mu' fucka
And this is The Prefix, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Go get that Carter album too when it drops
It's supposed to be June 22nd or something
I don't know, it's up to Universal
But when it do drop, go get that shit
But right now, at this given place and time, I'm tired of you niggas
I need a bed everywhere I go to go to bed every time I hear the bullshit
I'm tired of this shit man, I'm tired of that
It's gon' be real fucked up when I get sick and tired of you niggas
I'mma throw up on one of you boys
How would you like that, huh?
Get trashbags for you, cause you're garbage

It's your boy Weezy, from Hollygrove I'm still loc'in
I'm Mannie fresh from the t-shirt to the Forces
Pink got my feet wet, bitch I'm still soakin'
Steppin' out ashy, I need a little lotion
You niggas funny, you gotta be jokin'
My Glocks speak out and the bullets outspoken
I take a week out on the map of the ocean
Way in the middle of the Atlantic I'm tokin'
Just in case one of these niggas jaws open
I jaws 1-2-3-4 bow him
They say he gotta be seasick, how he spit
Keep kickin' it, but you'll never see my knee bent
Little niggas I started went off the deep end
But I ain't trippin', I just keep my gun
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
I got 99 partners and a snitch ain't one
I got 99 bitches and I don't love one
My 1999 bitches I been done
In 2000 it was mine, now that's his son
Go Weezy, that's what the freaks say
He like head when he ridin' on the freeway
And them threeways on a weekday
I stopped fuckin' with a girl on her P day
I'm playin', I take you to a whole 'nother land
Get you a Tiffany band
If you're sick of me stuntin' then I hope you die sufferin'
In the city dolo most of the time
Since a nigga say I want most of the shine
I hit your head really open your mind
Rude boy dreads, I'm red smokin' a pine
I take a bath with your ho and mine
And make a little butter so it go in fine
I flow tough, you can't go with mine
Message to Miss Cita, I'm focused mom

If y'all see them boys tonight
Wait 'til they come up out of them lights
Make 'em come up off of that ice
Bring it back to the hood and flip they shit twice

Get your shit sliced
Boy, get your ho card swiped
Credit or debit pussy, I decline your life
Writin' to Rocafella, protectin' the mozzarella
With the toaster strudel, you niggas is noodles
I'm just tryin' to get my palms on that parmesan
You know the usual, pop smoke and neutral
We are not mutual, we are not pupils
We are not peoples, you are not eagle
You're not Cash Money or Young Money either
You're thinkin' I'mma beat you, I'm thinkin' where should I leave you
I'm legal, respected like a Visa
Kick early game to your bitch like cold pizza
I'm kinda hot, but she don't mind
You might shoot once, I'll bang 3, 4 times
5, 6, 7-8-9
The 10'll empty it, that's the one that I kill you with
Weezy F Baby flow genuine
The track screamin' just like my bitch, "Boy, you killin' it!"
Weezy F Baby flow genuine
The track screamin' just like my bitch, "Boy, you killin' it!"

Microphone check 12 or just 1-2
I am me who are fuck you
And I'm 1-2 high you should look up to me
My french girls love it when we smoke the ooey
On bellow fronts I do and we smoke the ooey
I do me she feels me cummin like new teeth
I got paper like loose leaf
Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets
My bodies unique like the sisteen chapple
I should cut myself to see if my bloods red
Baby I brainstorm call me flood head
Married to the money
And if she leaves me bury me money
And when your not good then your arrogance is funny
And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy



Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
For the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin' from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's Glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!


Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Weezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip cause they breathe and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the Glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house




Now the rules of the family has nothing to do with the outside world
The outside world don't count here this is an inner circle of our family
What we say goes
Anybody anyplace else that disrespects you deal with us
If you're with us you're with us, and that's it
That's the way it goes, Are you listeninin to me?
That's the way it goes, there's no such thing
As an outsider comming in, we don't let no one in
We use all of them to do our dirty work
And they come in they do our dirty work and that's just the way it is
Your Family is your life that's what it is life and death



Prada jeans... 300 dollars
Gucci slippers... 500 dollars
Spending all your money to make these white folks rich... Priceless

They said opposites attract, so here I am
With my pistol in my pocket, hidden right under my jacket
They said opposites attract, so here she is
With a Masters and a Bachelor, she just became a doctor
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night

Pocket full of money and some dark shades
Flow so current, he can start waves
Game like butter, he Parkays
Love me some head like chardays
Coppin' quarters like the arcade
Get high with my animals in our cage
And you can see us if you star gaze
Creole boy, baby I sautees
On your mark, ready, start race
That's just you makin' my heart race
And I may be the opposite, but I'mma let you operate


And I know she want a D-boy
I got that magic, like Bruce Leroy
And if this isn't it, then love has a decoy
Her body sicker than a retard
And I bet I got the medicine she need for it
And i bet I got the medicine to keep goin'
She shoots me with happiness, and I bleed joy
No Band-Aid for me boy
A loss of blood, yeah the girl got me weak boy
Yeah, I see you, and I see you
When I see you, girl, you're the one, can I be two?
And if your love is clear, then I see through
Then they yell "clear," and I pull through
You saved my life, baby I would too
And they say...







Young Weezy We and Eric B, aha
Yes lord, I love them dark, I love them light
But there's this one particular situation I need to tell you all about

I met a honey about a week ago
I got a little but I need some more
I ain't the only one to learn her curves
Matter of fact, forget what you heard
She's all, she's all that and more, oh yeah
Yes she is
Her reputation ain't squeaky clean
A little gossip ain't phasing me
So go ahead say what you want
You can give a damn, but I don't
Cause I'm gone, I'm already gone
Yes I am
Don't you know she's

She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah

Our baby hail from the Oakland Bay
Got an east coast vibe but a southern mind
A devil mind with an angel face
She'll leave and make a nonbeliever pray
For a chance, just to get some something
Yes she will
Uhh, you don't know what you do to me
But you're killing the girls in my history
I need a shot just to let her hit
She give me 2 when I need a fix
Lord knows I've tried, but I swear I can't quit
Don't you know she's my

She's my, redbone girl
Redbone but she's my world
Have you seen, my chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, ooh

I like the long hair thick redbone
I do it so right, she say I'm dead wrong
And now she in love, like phase on
Now I'm in my zone, I got her head spinning, spinning like a cyclone
And it's them red women at my red eye zone
I'm high and my girl high yella
Fine as wine, put her in a wine cellar
Roses are red, do you mind if I smell them
What can you do, Consuela, Consuela
I like them light skin, lighter than a feather
And if she red hot, I'm biting that pepper
Tighter than my leather pants, let them say
She the same color as my flag – suwoo

She's my, redbone girl
Redbone, she's my world
Have you see, my milk chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but you know she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
Redbone girl, my redbone girl, yeah

I'm just a rocka dude
Lookin for my rocka girl
Baby I'll rock your boat
Rock your bed, and rock your world
But you gotta be as fly as me
You gotta know how to rock your stuff
VH1 Brett Michael, Be my rock of love
VS 1, big stones
Lemme rock ya
Maybe marriage, baby carriage
Lemme knock ya up
I could be your rocka daddy
You could be my rocka mommy
I could your chilly pepper
You could be my hot tamale
Have your ever made to a rockstar
In a hot car with the top off
In the middle of a parkin lot
You don't care who see, who look, or who watch ya
Pretty face
And the body soft as baby skin
She hopped on me and rode
I thought my name was Harley Davidson

You got your tattoos
I got my tattoos too
We stay up all night and do what rockstars do
We got the music
Bumpin thru the system
The room is real smoky
Highlights in a mansion
We lovin all night
We sleepin all day
Wake up and hit the mall
Stay fresh and rock our way
They try to imitate us
They could never duplicate us
Pull up in the Ferrari
Saying hello to all my haters

Have you ever mad love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love

You drive a fast car
I drive a fast car too
Suicide doors with the topless roof
Now we're cruisin
Glasses on the face
Cus he ducking paparazzi, they high speed chasin
We got a maserati but we drivin in a range
Cus we don't give a damn
Switch rides by the day, day, day
Now this is what I call rockstar love
This was the question I was thinkin of

Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love

I'm a r-o-c-k star
And I can play with that pussy like I play my guitar
Call me Weezy F the best you ever saw
She the best you never saw goo you ain't even lookin
Got a chauffeur but he ain't even lookin
We in the back seat poppin like fried chicken cookin
And I'm tied to that pussy like flies on my duce
Shawty got class
And no I won't play hooky
But no not never
Put my feet on the pedal
And make that guitar go madder like
Told ya girl
I could play with that pussy like I play my guitar

Professional dope boy, my office is the Carter

You don't know, what you do

Lock & load, pull the triggers and roll
The bigger ya mouth, the bigger the hole
We figured em out, them niggas is hoes

But me I'm quick on my toes I remember the code
You need a pass for the hood, watch me get through the toll
I been through the cold, I shot through the fire
Still rock too much ice, should've got you a visor
I pull up, the bitches flock & admire
Fresh like I just stepped out of a dryer
Yes!
No fret,I got the lock of a lion
Its eagle street ho, the whole block is behind me
Stay low, the cops is spying
But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron
Pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig em a hole, let the property hide em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I'll never fail, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah may seem cool
But me,I'd rather not let them see my food

Evil empire, DJ EFX
Remix Mafia, 3 6, we sick, make hit records prestigious

Meet up at the Days Inn then turn the beat up
Re-up, yea I'm trynna get a key up
Say the game locked, Wayne better get a key up
Velour suit FILA, feet up 2 seater
We up in the Poconos brewing that tea up
Bet better yet ? like cheya
Mean sixteens that'll end your career
We are, right here mon frere
From the same label that brought you Aaliyah
Prayer, in the air one shot, one tear
Warning, these rap niggas not what they appear
Never been cheap Louis Vs on my ear
This a hip-hop premier
Talking old school D and D like ?
And tell Splash "yea homie this our shit"
The flow crack, go and get the ?
Now clip that, take it back to the projects
I obsess over trying to be the best
But if it's no struggle, then it's no progress
And that's a hard pill that I try and digest
I just kill them off soft like Wyclef
Rooms in the sky, dead men fly
These type of words make a grown man cry
If we ain't talking money homie I'll see you later
Kinda faded with this thick bitch looking like Jada
Take her back to the truck, then we fuck
Then I ate her, made her nut
Got her up, now she talking 'bout payment
Baby you already know that the flow so crazy
Nothing more, nothing less
Yes, you are now rocking with the best



Turn the music up

Tattoos on my face nigga, Grill shining in your face nigga
In the coupe hitting corners like a maze nigga

And shorty got crazy paper
Cash Money's my army, my navy paper
Understand, Weezy is made of paper

I told her I could run it, run it just like relay
'Cause I'm cool
Just like the breeze-way now pushin' like salt and p-e-p-p-a

Push push girl
Mr. Morales
Push push girl
Push push girl
Push push



I sit here alone everyday
Everyday at my window, my living room window
Thinkin' 'bout you
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo? Where did it go?
No time for video games, no time for SEGA
Oh no, but I'm in space
I don't know if it is this girl face
Or how she taste, but I like it

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into

But I like it, ooh I like it
When you doin' it, how I like it
So keep doin' it, how I like it
Cause I like it, ooh I like it

I like sex in the mornin', I like sex at night
I like sex on the weekends, is that alright?
Alright, alright, all night, alright?
Come on, I got shampoo chilled
Took off her dress but kept on the heels
Damn baby, you so exotic
Holler my name loud when I'm inside it
No shame, I ate her pride
Tickled the pearl tongue and came up smilin'
Two dips a dip, and now we ridin'
Bed to the sink, sink to the shower
Back to the sink, back to the bed

I get cold, I get goosebumps
And I head out the door, that's similar to her name
I'm so cold, but with her, all alone
I'm so high, I'm nearly hittin' the flame
She told me her name is Crazy
And I said "Hi, they call me Insane"
Crazy and Insane is so high up in the tree
F.U.C.K.I.N.G

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know what I will do
I guess I, I guess I, would just die
Go to Heaven and wait on you

Ooh, I think I like you
If you was a poem, I would recite you
The bed could be our ring, I wanna fight you
Put my key in your ignition, let me ignite you
The cops keep comin', the cops keep comin'
To my front door like I'm trynna do somethin'
They don't understand that I'm involved with a woman
That love to make noise when she feel it in her stomach
I'mma have to talk to the neighbors
Matter of fact, let me take a walk by the neighbors
I don't know what the hell wrong with the neighbors
And what they expect when an animal is matin'
Knock on the door, like chicky-chicky-check it
Life is a party, don't ricky-ricky-wreck it
Y'all will call the cops and report a domestic
When I'm just trynna kill a problem called erection
Head in the coupe, call it sex on wheels
I'm a big dude, I treat sex like meals
She ride me for breakfast, I'm on top for lunch
And behind her for dinner, for dessert she say "yum"

I sit here alone everyday
Everyday, everyday in living room window
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo?
No time for video games, no sir
No time, no time for SEGA
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into
But I like her, I like her, I like her
And if she leave, I don't know what I'll do
I do know, I'd go to Heaven
And darlin' I'mma wait on you

Yeah, baby
She likes it
She likes it
She likes it
I'm a R.O.C.K.S.T.A.R
Young Mula, baby
She likes it
And she likes it
Cause I do me, how she likes it
I'mma do me, how she likes it
She know I do her, how she likes it
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a love
I'mma make a love movie
I'mma make a movie

I pull up, I pull up and I fade away
Thats MBA yeah

I’m my momma’s son
And when I started thugging I was young
When I started cussing, I was one
Momma put that soap on the tongue
And when I started hustling, I was 12
And then I started pumping out the Shell
And when I started fucking, I was young
And when I started cuppin', I was sprung
And then I started drugging, it was fun
Fucking with that honey, I got stung
And when I go out clubbing, I be numb
Started up from nothing, just some crumbs
Started up from nothing, just some crumbs
And now I got a bakery, yum, yum
And now I see the fakery, now I see the snakery
All I got is 2 words, blumb blumb
No ceilings
