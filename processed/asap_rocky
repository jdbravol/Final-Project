I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

Hold up, bitches simmer down
Takin' hella long, bitch, give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a 9
Ooh, baby like it raw with the shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, A$AP, get like me
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome, make you sweat like Keith
‘Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Gettin' figures and fuckin' bitches
She rollin' Swishers, brought her bitches
I brought my niggas, they gettin' bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act nigga-ish
But least a nigga nigga rich
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fuckin' boys; beast

Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on
Oh word? Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Dick so big, it’s like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

Big KRIT, shawty
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist

I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Let's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up some money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags

Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup 'til I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimping hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
Going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids

Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap
Benjamin Three-Stack, it’s a fact, she lives in my lap
On my Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we going

I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause every day we on our pesos

Your bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still
So mami show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga

Rocking, rolling, swagging to the max
My bitch a fashion killa, she be busy popping tags
She got a lotta Prada, that Dolce and Gabbana
I can't forget Escada, and that Balenciaga
I'm sipping purple syrup, come be my Aunt Jemima
And if you is a rider, we'll go shopping like mañana
Her attitude Rihanna, she get it from her mama
She jiggy like Madonna, but she trippy like Nirvana
Cause everything designer, her jeans is Helmut Lang
Shoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna
Karan, wearing all the Cartier frames
Jean Paul Gaultiers cause they match with her persona

I see your Jil Sanders, Oliver Peoples
Costume National, your Ann Demeuelemeester
See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain
Goyard by the trunk, her Isabel Marant
I love your Linda Farrow, I adore your Dior
Your Damir Doma, Vena Cava from the store
I crush down with that top down, bossy see how I ride 'round
Mami in that Tom Ford, Papi in that Thom Browne
Rick Owens, Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall, that means she shop 'til she drop
But she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents

Scoop back tees, breeze in the coupe
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together
Bags and links, jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together
You and me, me and you
Go away together, we could get away forever
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out

Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go...

Off again, there he go
To another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye
Prolly goin' ballistic, but listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws
They ain't never do drillin', true, you
Been sippin' away at the truth
A double shot of wisdom'll do, do, do
Rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses
To the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence
Go to prison
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holla if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless
But hold it, I'm gettin' close as my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts
A solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Here I go, here I go, here I go

Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow

I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

But I don't need love no more, oh, no

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?

Duh, duh-duh

I look for ways to say, "I love you"
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD

Fuck niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply
Igh, igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh

Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply

I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga
I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?
Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag swag nigga

Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back
No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back
B-Boy with the G pack, might fuck around and bring the mink back
Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga
If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga
I'm a trend setter, you ain't even peep that
Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at?
Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that
Ya'll got Flacko fucked up)

I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit
Don't I deserve just to brag a bit?
Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents
Number 1 stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch
I think back to when pockets packin' lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp, bitches lie, killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride
Prosper said let's ride to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch

Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6, suck a nigga dick, no foreplay, all day
Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris, fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' but they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptised in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan

I hustle every day in life, thinkin' back
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped backpack
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
On my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spend on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it

You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favourite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit

I'm camo down to my boxers, gold teeth, a Bathing Ape
It's animals in my projects like monkeys, orangutans
Banana clip on that chopper, I hold heat, bangers bang
I don't care if you blue or you red flagging, hair swinging, my pants sagging
Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch gagging, she jet lagging
All my cuz niggas, what's cracking? All my blood niggas, what's popping?
I ain't set tripping, I just happen to know who click clacking, you mismatching
Fuck swag and you been jacking, fuck fly, I am fashion
Tryna cop that Benz wagon, my bitch drive it and my friends crash it
Niggas threat with the chit-chatting, see a nigga don't shit happen
I'm finna blow on that Bin Laden, so talk money, pig latin

Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me, meet the brand new guys

345 be the big toy, now which nigga want it with the fat boy?
Clipped-up like I'm paranoid, high as hell nigga, Fitzroy
Pull it off through the city like "errt"
Seen that ho nigga like "errrr," hopped up on a nigga like murk
Put that pussy nigga in a purse
You wouldn't be the first, cover him with dirt
Put him in the ground, he was down to Earth
Napped up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes, I'll teach you how to jerk
Teach you how to jerk, swaggin' in my Js
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave
My prerogative ways
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade
Brand new nigga with the brand new venue
Sold that bitch out shoulda made that ho bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and the dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed, I'm digging her out
Just filling her out
Do all that shit you be talking about
While you gone? Shit, Netflix on your couch
What this popcorn about?
Microwave oven while you out there cuffin'
You over there lovin'
That bitch be my stuffing, like...like we really be fucking

Brand new shirt to the brand new drawers
Brand new socks to the brand new Glock
This mothafucka hold 15, slap that ho in, tell the clip get lost
Bitch, I'm a boss, pulled up clean, don't you hear the exhaust
Got my tie on, gripping on my iron, who I'm 'bout to fire on?
Rap game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I rap for?
Crack game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I trap for?
Riding 'round with that mask on, like a Mac attack when that strap on
Like a Shaq attack on that backboard, clap on, clap off
Blue pit in my back yard Red nose my bad broad
Titan full of that hydro Pretty nigga, no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth Pussy niggas suck lead off
I pull it up then skirt off, vodka shots, he Smirnoff
40 ounce of that Cristal, Rose, that Rick Ross
Got it jumping like Kriss Kross Mismatching, no jigsaw
No horseplay when we quick draw Pussy nigga get a tit job
Hands up, stick your mans up, your time's up, the new brand's up, Q!

Do just what I tell you
Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
‘Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two

A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André
Beef is on my entree, gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway
Come be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days
Finally got it today, swear to god my mood changed
Top off like toupees, drop off, touche
Yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G
Riding on my enemies, this my ghetto symphony

Whipping Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive forget it, war ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
Till my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in its purest form
Don't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports

Don't come in any closer...

Since Rocky spit like André, I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée, eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed, know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid, body get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
That's for talking how fast you could grip a nine
Damn, look how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit the crime
These niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died? Never!
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga

All I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life
I coulda been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hanging, my top back
Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out

How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on

So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need

It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungie cord
Yeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80
Turn a baby into a lady, now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper, all you got to do is tip her
She like ballers with some money screaming fuck them other niggas
Now do A through Z for a G, panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me, smackin' that ass to the beat, give her that Diggity-D

Smoke, Ty Beats
Better do it 'til we get right, uhh

This is for my niggas getting high on the regular
This is for my bitches getting high on the regular

Purple drank, I still sip, purple weed blunt still lit
Real nigga, real bitch, purple swag, that trill shit

That pimp shit, she ain't plan to fuck, I pick her up, I still hit
That's swag, bitch

I said

Purple swag, purple swag,I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow

Robitussin, quit discussing, ASAP tell these niggas something, swag

For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the days, man

With your electric body, with your electric body

Back once again, sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin Benjamins
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush mothafuck the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sipping on that codeine
We hustle hard no sleep, your bitch loose that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a façade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second
Pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second

Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror
Yeah, clothes getting weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up
The nerve of this dude
But I'm cool as a fan, 40 ounce full of brew

I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles and overbites
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it

I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly

It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise

One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go

What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed, comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated

I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though, them diamonds

Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's
Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Make 'em talk about, talkin' bout M's, nigga
Talkin' bout M's

It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount

Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh

Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right
I got mean, I got nice, That's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl I'mma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems, let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out, she limp, it's dark and we dim, yeah
We dem niggas, handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga, Tunechi

These other niggas so-so, they open off my mojo
Spanish Sophie with a half a kilo by her cho-cho
Blow it out your culo, who got dough on the smoke though
My partner had cinco now we blowin' on that ocho
Bozos love my rose gold, purple got me slow-mo
Stuntin' like I'm Dorothy but my rubies in my gold though
What you think this four for, these niggas must be loco
Steppin' on these bricks and for your fix so call me Toto
Follow me, follow me, follow me now

Now I'mma come through getting down
Got a new Cadillac with a diamond in the back
Got a bitch and she bad with about a hundred tats
Got my goons on deck, and we got a hundred straps
What you know about that, got me swaggin' to the max
Everybody know we got the shit and baggages to match
Better come correct, fuck what the basis is
Gold grills like a set of new braces's

Why they comment on my set though, they lookin' cause my neck gold
And I let that Tec show... hear that echo?
Let go, that medal, .38 special, to your threshold
Niggas actin' petro, like they sexual, was metro
Bunch of bad bitches fuckin' out on tour
Like it through the backdoor, give it to her raw

Comin' down stuntin' like a bitch, bitches on my dick
On the set and they like the nicotine to cigarette
How they fiending for a nigga got these hoes up on my sack
Got my niggas in the back, couple bitches in the bed
ASAP where it's at, where that weed, how that cake
Bitches all up in my face, back back, give me space
Cas you know how we do it, niggas scream ASAP
Aye Clams nigga, tell me where that bass at?

Bass, uhh!!

Goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss

Stone cold love, rose gold slugs
I could afford it, I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned nigga
Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she's got a coke feel cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toe nails
Them vampires, them blood suckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it 'bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal
We smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass, making it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, making 'em crash
Took in a section ain't giving it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
An insight to my trill life
Clams

I know the whole world gon' be feeling this

One, two, umm
Buckle my, umm

Pass the mothafuckin' Swisher, pour some mothafuckin' liquor
For my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla
My gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school like gemstars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname
Cause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe, a weirdo but I'm real though

All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
A$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up
I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up
Huh, young niggas run everything
A$AP to the top and these bitches love everything

God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Your bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Kitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen
Business man, middle finger to your fucking business, man
Great adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do
Always $trive and Prosper rock what level we gon' take it to?

When I'm a man of my word, then I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like "Flacko where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now yo ass is acting"
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage, Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture
Changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture, I be damned if I die sober
I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher, grab your lighter fluid
Might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah, Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it

Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap I'm fashion forward, yeah I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familliar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the "love" word

More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you my lonely one
What's up bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh! Man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male
Hallelujah

All I think about is life, nights, sippin' on Sprite
Little arguments in the fist, don't fight
So them R Kelly hoes gettin' pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice
Young nigga cold like he sit on ice
Fuck broke, tryin' to be rich all life
I could've been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hangin', my top back
Hoes screamin' that Pac back
Throwin' Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, gotta Pac tat
Hoes all in my jock strap
And my bitch white, but my cock black
Purple drink, got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk somethin'
Bounce on me, bitch, hurt somethin'
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth somethin'
So shawty, she a stunna and daddy, he a runna
So she shakin' it fast and then makin' the stacks
And I'm takin' it back and I'm takin' her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kickin' her out

How ‘bout me and you, and you and her
So I say

Uh, smokin' out, pourin' up
Purple drink up in my cup
Bitches actin' Hollywood
In my hood they wanna fuck
Purple stuff, yellow tuss
Yellow stuff look like a bus
She look like the type to front
But most likely the type to fuck
Make a buck, catch a nut
This shit be that trill livin'
Show you how the trill get it
Nigga, Pimp C gone, but he still livin'
Cause I'm still sippin' and my grill's glistenin'
Got me gold grills, shinin' and I'm still tippin'
Cause I'm still pimpin', but it feel different
Cause it's trill pimpin', nigga deal with it
That's all a nigga need, that's all a nigga need
Got a bitch up on my shoulder, got another on my sleeve
I said these bitches know my steeze
WV's, weak in the knees
Got them bitches movin' them keys
Rollin' the weed, duckin' them G's
Got a bad bitch from Belize, another overseas
If she don't wear no weave, then her hair down to her knees
Got my wifeys smokin' trees, my bad bitch on that E
But that pussy, money, weed, shit that's all a nigga need

I keep two killas with me
Keep two bitches with me
Two guns with me
Y'all know who I be, I be that pretty motherfucker man

Get niggas for the Goyard, it cost too much so we bogart

Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B-bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga

Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas
I’ll die for my niggas, man, fuck them other niggas!

Lord, please talk to me Lord
I am here for you Lord

Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!

Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come Gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we live this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords

"This negra kept his soul from the Devil"
It's true, I guess I mean, wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ign'ant? Really? Really?

Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My attire sells, how you tryna sound? Stop it now
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
'Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs, my sister the next stripper
My brother the next victim, my usher the next tricker
Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray you fit upstairs, it's our only hope
Bow your head, the Most High's around, Lord
The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Yeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses
The ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers
Who's more important than your Lord and Savior?
Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably due to all your poor behavior
My mental got a couple tips to save ya
Just be sure to count it as my only favor, thank me later
Uh, every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh
Let's savior chasin' green for collard greens and baked potatoes
On the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major
Ha, I got my own relationship with God, Lord

Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
Holy Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need

Niggas pistol-poppin' like it's 1999

Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know

Cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes

Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts

Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP

Cocaine up on my gums, I think they’re going numb
I’m having stomach pains, now I’m throwing up
Cause I’m a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day that my team, we can make it with this rapping
Now we swagging, making money in Manhattan, trick what’s happening

Throwing up gang signs, fuck a goon and a goblin
Gold grill shining, don't ask me how I got 'em
Styrofoam cups with jolly ranchers at the bottom

Purple on the mustache, now it's time to screw you
And I wanna chop and screw you, girl
Moving like it's turtle time feeling like the world is my mine
And I be on my Fergenstein

To the ceiling, now my niggas gunning for a billion
They ask me how I'm living, I say I'm gold grilling
Niggas acting different, mothafuck a friendship
These bitches is persistent, talking 'bout I'm distant
Lost my mind a long time ago to find it, need forensics
For instance, I get-get my dick licked
Red bone, complexion like a piglet, kiss-kiss
Fuck Ace, we sip Cris, a 40 cause I'm getting it
I'm ticklish, stunting is my business
Swagging on you hoes and I'm shitting on you niglets
So little homie, peep game

Well, let me tell you 'bout a nigga like me

Straight to the telly, shaking her jelly with my dick inside
Hit it in motion, in slow motion, hit it

With it, get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs, let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said, I'mma still do me
Groupies, be sucking and fucking, porno movie
Do we have a problem in here
Look a nigga in the eye as I notice the fear
I am severe, my style is hella sharp, like a spear
All I do is sit back and think with a 40 beer
And you gotta feel the funk
While the bass plays loud booming all in your damn trunk

This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes

And this love, and this love, and this love gon' own our

I think my cup is getting muddy, oh buddy
Is this that punch, drunk, and love it, no buggy?
Eyes bloody when we out in public
I'm hubby, she say she love me
Wasted money on syrup and honey, she think she Duffy
Then I became a druggy, enhanced my fame and money
And for your pain and suffering, my karma's waiting for me
Expecting payments from me
But she won't get a damn thing from me
She just might get a band aid from me
You swear the Benz and these bands ain't from me

I know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke
The night is still young, for you to sip and whine
I know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass
With your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow

How the fuck am I supposed to live?
How many fucks am I supposed to give?
How the fuck am I supposed to feel?
Treated like a bell, cut the check and split
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick

You the one that was putting up with me
You see how these streets corrupted me
I gotta conquer everything in front of me
Even though I broke your heart, how can you turn on me?
We with the shits on the real
I do this shit on the real, I like them drinks on the real
I fuck your bitch on the real
We do this shit on the real, keep it real on the real
I was just keeping it G, she don't spend money at first
Say you're in love with me, but I know it never gon' work
I come through, top back, hangin' out the Vert
Eyes screwed up, I'm drinkin' syrup
I know that look that you givin' me
It's killing you softly mentally

We use to wear rugged boots, now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
My partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we﻿ sophisticated goons
I know you live by the gun then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swagging and philosophies
White on white wagon, call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass niggas, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunting yea I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious, so serious, Wapanese
There your reasons go bitch
I got some tissues for your issues tell 'em blow this
Bitch!

Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?

Roger, roger, tell em roger that
It’s the gold teeth, French braids, call me Project Pat
With the stocking cap, Jason mask on, probably strapped
It’s the Rocky cat, turn my swag on, holla back
Throw a dollar at a bidd-itch, tell er suck my di-dick
Cause they hatin on my clid-dick
Cause we made it when we did it, hate it cause they didn’t
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
Ride with the pretty nigga, hoopty, no chauffeur
Paint lookin like a drippin smoothy, no coaster
The game's full of posers, big dog bulldozer
Pop up on 'em like toasters, wake 'em up like Folgers
Cuz Heaven need a villain like Hell need a newer idol
You could bet the crib and car, just renew the title
For now I’m po-pimpin' like them Do or Die dudes
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal

It will hit you on the head
You don’t even gotta hate me now babe
Just as sheeps get led, ohh
You could see where I'm going, ohh
How you gonna feel now? You know what they say
Really you know that we don’t come how we get down
Everyone say that Rocky ahead
They rollin, do what he said, no they can't get it wrong

Smoking rolling reefer up, I adjust the tweakers up
Break it, break it down, break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back? Where the welcome mat? My sneaker tough
This is for my old head go on turn your speakers up
Rocky, where you been? I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm Big Meech
I met with my old head we sat for a while
We rolled a couple swishers, we chat for a while
I said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time
He said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind
Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up
Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out

Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, foes they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight

Now my old head old age bald head rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein
Gold chains afros platforms soul train
And he told me 'bout that rapping trapping in the old days
When Pac hung with Suge before that rat tat tat tat nose rings
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, slow swing, tip foes and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin cause that type of shit'll get you clapped

- Yo, what's your name, young blood? What they call you?
- Well I got, I got, James, Jimmy or Byron Dean
- Yeah, I've been feeling that really JD swag lately

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace
Uh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas
I'm offin' niggas, screaming off with niggas' heads
They all surrender, better call for niggas
Come at all you niggas heads, talk 'em off a ledge
I'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em
I order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em
Get a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas' beds
I want all you niggas dead
You want oil nigga money, royalness and bread
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead

Now I'm only up again
Kick... kick a man while he's down
Looks dead; can’t be safe to say it
Everybody's getting punished
Looking down to sell with you, how have you been?
Probably an undercover, had them undercovers with you
People buying and selling for you
I'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell

Rep my block, quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef
Blow your spot, better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets
Jimmy Dean

"I'm so happy, you know um
You know I looked at the crowd and you know
I look at my fans, I look at their faces, they expressions
And I know that damn well, we are some partying mothafuckas"

Tired of these rappers, tired of these jackers
Tired of these dances by these fucking backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters, I'm sick of phony niggas
I'm sticking to these bitches, cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive, I'm sick tired of my environment
I'm sick and tired of feeling deprived, I'm one of a kind, when in my climate
I'm sick and tired of your facade and all of your lying and all your diamonds
Basically, I'm tired of feeling sick and tired
A$AP, born in money makin' Manhattan
Every nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attrakion
Shout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre
If you disrespect them niggas then I'm polishin' the nine-trey
And I'm coming to your casa for your madre and padre
Comprende? Most of these niggas been gay or they strange
They say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye, little bit of Max
Little bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this, get off my dick

I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me

Once again, Mister Back Selling Crack
It's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
Street raps, new face, sampled with no credits
Doubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
Cause last year it was shoe box and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's 20 years of memory
And that's assuming I'mma live that long
If I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino

Why fuss? I'd rather fuck
Treat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust
7 deuce, waiting on the bus
Before the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust
Tryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I two-step, move my foot and keep it pushing
Always bouncing back, got it keep the cushion
And that's something fat, like eating all the pudding
A$AP we got it slap, bruh good looking
Fuck That, ASAP where I come from
456, Ice City slums
Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying swisher sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigga round here rocking Мишка

"This go out to all the rappers, this go out to the little darlings
The little kids running around in the schoolyards, I love you
Keep it good, keep it good kids cause you know I love you
I'mma always love you, forever"

Smoke
Ty Beats

Back in this bitch mothafucka, yeah it's me
SpaceGhostPurrp and I put your bitch to sleep
Me and my twin at it again with this phonk
Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk
RIP to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp C
Shout out to the H and that fucking SUC
My fucking brain is purple, nigga

It be that pretty mothafucka sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol, my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin 4's since back in 06
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch
Two middle fingers to the show, bitch
Cause they selfish in the show biz
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish
I be the fly young fella, Maison Martin Margiela
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her

All hell here, bitch it's Satan talking
Told her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain? Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way, a hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper, smoking on purple
Bitch, I'm Dangerous Nasty Crazy 90's Baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement, hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways, so fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? I'm chasing this paper, that's purple, nigga

Get money addict, I'mma get "Money" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiella, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leacher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead, you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met J-Hov

You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, Blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No it ain't a movie, diamonds in by new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing

Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne
Fly kicks, my shit, yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, save the bullshit for the Q-Tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin on the block like Whoo Kid
ASAP standing on the block like the new kids

I thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuck
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuss
Holdin’ back, ain’t no turnin’ back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat ‘cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I’m here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured

You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on her left titty

Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
So, so

My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage vacant, lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh

I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep

Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Some boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, awhole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living

Uh, pain

So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call when no one else around

It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action

The future will be televised, haters getting genocide
23 and 43, I'm talking my Margiela size
My niggas is hella fly, you over accessorize
Dead alive, it’s in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, I’m a king ask Coretta Scott
Cute faced, fat ass, and a nice set of thighs
Rihanna weave, I need a umbrella, ella, ella, ah

Everybody knows me, shit, still ain’t got no cash
Bitch, hit that flash quick, post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram, match a gram, Mando
Royal blue foams, getting head in the red Lambo
Media take me out, TMZ all in the VIP
Bitch I’m hard and my loop concrete, too much Bossip if you ask me
Almost fucked fame, but she came with money
I got two bad bitches, haters wanna take em from me

Tryin' to get on in this industry, acting like you're ruthy
Breaking down cocaine with the EBT, these male groupies doing it
However, whatever they seeing on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot, everybody's an artist, everybody not
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talking dollars getting change
In a minute I'mma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I’m cutthroat, so what goes
Do you head for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within

Glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that bathing ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer Time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Life is what you need, won't you take a Z, feel the breeze
Smoke the sour diese', hit that shit and please, act at ease
What you wanna be like the Black Eyed Peas, all these steezs
S-T-A-R-S, that’s Hollywood, won’t you rest in peace?

… Through the spot
Everyday was like a beef to me
Little nigga said he’d make it hot
You don’t wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that’ll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga, you don’t really want beef
I’m Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
My bitch now tryna comfort me
And baby I wonder, baby I wonder

Buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat?
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back

And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what's up blood clots?
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip...

I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder

And I wonder, as I'm laying in my bed
And I wonder, as I'm laying down in bed

Sorry guys

Show up when it's closing
Turn up then I go in
With me, myself, and I
And just a couple of my brohans
Cuz I don't need no homeland
Security, my own man
That means I am a grown man
Want beef and then we go HAM
Like, whoa damn, that old man
She twerkin' it with no hands
These other niggas hatin'
They remind me of my old friends
Golden and I'm glowin'
My shoes is Ricky Owen
Coke man
My business ain't the only thing her nose in
People takin' pictures, I ain't even posin'
Couple famous niggas make these bitches slow dance
Reality, she sweatin' me
Her fantasy is sexin' me
Just for standin' next to me
Will make you a celebrity

Don't get too close, too close
I might come on to you
I'm warnin' you
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be famous
Just the standin' next to me

Same bitch in my Vanquish
Ass in my Aston, lane switch
When the paint drip when I blast past
Swag on a champagne drip
Let it splash on 'em
Bang this, I ain't pay shit
You spent your last on 'em
That's the reason why I'm with her
These other bitches bitter
I'm the quickest picker-upper
I will hit her then I'll quit her
Then I give her to my niggas
I'm no kidder, split her kitty litter
Finger in her shitter
Then forget her like we never did her

Snowin', blowin'
Frozen, coke land, snowman
Went from ex-pretty boy crook slash dope man
To handin' out hundred dollar bills to the doorman
Now somebody please let the hoes in
Now somebody please let my bros in
Boy, you won't believe how my foes end?
Overnight celebrities, they party 'til the show ends

The hustle continues
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
Put your mind to, something you want
It come true

I thought you knew
I thought y'all knew
It's what I do

I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

Candy low slider, I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck bout how you feel

I'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James
Got a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne
The Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands
Prada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a lamb
Your girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me
Hell naw I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches
$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

Get money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' break ups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
I'm moving...

War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim
Raw dogs, you other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

Uhh, Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it on plenty
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis, bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on em?
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams

Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini
We gon' take it uptown one time
We gon' take em back home, show em how me do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr
Yasiin Bey

Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to Arizona, steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready rover, Flacko glowing in that Owens
That's how it's going
Huh, awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin' man, moving through places
Space and time, in a country called Earth

Nah'mean? These tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures
Wearing all types of motherfuckin' red and green stripes
Over accessorizing out this motherfucker
We from Harlem, we gave y'all motherfuckers this wave
Grab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogie boards right now, fucker
Y'all just gon' keep watching us at the beach shore
With your motherfuckin' khakis rolled up
With your chancletas in your hand
And we just gon' keep surfing on this motherfucker
Straight up! It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini
Yo Rock man, let these motherfuckers know what it is
Out this motherfucker, A$AP, bitch!

Ay yo, it's the BET Cypher
The Man with the Iron Fists edition
Film out November 2nd yo
But right now check out these new hot weapons right here
Driicky Graham, A$AP Rocky, Angel Haze, Childish Gambino and Joey Bada$$
C'mon, splash em son

I came here with one intention to kill this
I'm talking head in my hands, mouth on that drill ish
I be on that wired insane, ultimate trill shit
And there is not a soul that can see me
Like I'm not real trick
Listen up niggas I'm tired of you lames
I'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains
And uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard
Spittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God
Plus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod
'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops
You know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love
I swear I never even lost in a coin toss
So bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit I’ll out drown mothafuckas
Somebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it
I'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin

Yo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul
Probably you know I found mines right through the pencil
Started bodying flows, but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal
This one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel
You can't be this good they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me better
See, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era

Swear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge
Since diapers and bibs
The light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids
Cypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen
Either that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend
She telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips
Suffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp
I'm the best, its hard to lose hope
I'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp
And looking in the mirror like aren't you dope
You so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap
Something sinister, raps that minister
You mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya
I'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous
And you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers
Eww, these days rappers on my TV
Are braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay
But I ain't tripping, I like groupie women
Who be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching
Fast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off
Pop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin
Niggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping
And if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling
Over the money I be pooky twitching
And honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'

Still good with a pen, no Joe Paterno
I count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them
Gambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard
Got the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card
Niggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine
Why the game fucked up like my hairline
Ay girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?
You ever gotten D like you don't study?
Rap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank
Filled with half of these trash lames
I have to say I'm such a Joey's last name
Bino boy, why you spit so mean
Why the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens
He on BET and he got White people problems
"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know
Trader Joe's and have it shipped to me"
Victory, history
More G than a kid's movie, Royalty

My name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac
That nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot
It’s dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'
Cause I’m cripping the lead on
I’m getting forensics twisting your head on
Traffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes
That shit, backwards, tactics
Bitches only like me for my status
Living ghetto fabulous and I’m still acting ratchet
Twenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads
Nigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage
Got a chick red like radish, have it
Bitches think they bad til I drop them like habits
No one in this cyph' has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Ever since a baby, ask my old lady
My first four words was, fuck you, pay me

Sex and hoes, best of both
Girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed
Comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded
I'm surprised that we made it
Shit, I'm surprised that we made it

Finna go in, go ham like Em'

But I don't even trip though
Bruh, bruh, yeah, I'm really with the shits though

Throw that shit up right now!

Shotgun pop, make the monetary add
Chop, won props with a military badge
Went AWOL cause I serve 8-balls
And I straight eggnog with the military axe
Pimping when I'm pinning, bitch you couldn't tell me that
Way too live, where the cemetery at?
Way too smart to wear the penitentiary hat
So remember, to the end or to infinity it's swag
Skinny nigga, Pretty Flacko, nigga gripping that chopper
Party like a rocker, now my niggas wilding with Flocka
Guess who just walked in with a Goyard bag
Sixteen gold teeth and four gold slabs
One dime piece, you already know she bad
My wrist said I'm rich, my whips say I made it
My tat say A$AP and your bitch say I'm famous
My whole clique dangerous
We creeping and sweeping them grams up
For niggas and bitches and killas with triggers
Who bucking and keeping them hands up

If you a trill nigga, get your mothafuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch, get your mothafuckin' hands up

Waka Flocka, loco loco, I don't fuck with po-po, po-po
FN on my hip, shorty, I'm not ridin' solo dolo
R.I.P. to Duncan Romo, pay for pussy, that's a no-no
Throwing money, dive in the crowd, shorty I take all that promo
Call me Pretty Gordo, baller, date a model, drinking Roma
Moscato keep me G'd up while I'm buying bottle after bottle
Thirty chicks, Frankie Lymon, he ain't balling, girl, he's just lying

My watch say I made it, my chains say I'm rich
Diamonds in my mouth got me talking cash shit
Kush Clark Kent, for dough, bitch what I spit
Fuck your main girl off my down south accent, Waka Flocka

My whip said I made it, my chain say I'm rich
Hit a lot of licks, sold a lot of bricks
Served a lot of pounds, and I will never quit
Gucci going loco, had that cocoa loco
Shorty say I fucked her, I don't really know, though
These ladies want a hug, baby want a photo
Blue and white diamonds bitch, I'm so Tony Romo
Thirty-four bricks, I crammed 'em in the van
Stack a lot of bands and I serve a lot of grams
Thirty-six O's, stamped with the dragon
Brick Squad, Bird Gang, yeah, we got them Falcons

Skatebord
Ya huured
I rock Chanel nigga and BAPE fish lures

Your girl hold my dick like a Wii controller
Where's your bitch, nigga? We control her
The weed she holding while she be over
And when she saw my mothafuckin' keys it's over
And when I start it up, she like, "Lean me over"
Cold heart, warm dick, momma we be polar
I wore Louboutins before they knew what they was
They like, "Louis Vuitton? Naw, uh-uh, cuz"
That's when I realized they didn't know what they was
Them niggas actin' like I fuckin' stepped in blood
O-7 2-11 man, I put out duds
And ate space cakes that was filled with bud
And now 2012 nigga, look at these scuds
Green hair, money on my mind, hip hop grunge
You wear a cross I wear a Cartier nail
You niggas ain't fuckin' with Pharrell
My wrist sizzle hot like it's stuck in the chair
My jewelry's so loud, it's got something to share
Like a conspiracy, like it's ACHAP, everybody on my dick like Ahab
Wait, did I say that? First pause, then play back, recognize nigga, ASAP

This is my story, my struggle, uh
My bittersweet symphony, my pain, check it

Food getting lower, money coming slower
Damn land lord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up, I pray to God I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive

Then I hit the stage, all gone and blazed
Everybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Living life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up fast so I feel like B.I.G
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change, niggas feel a little strange
Uh-oh truck flow, pull off in a range
Niggas say I changed but I'm living it up
Shit if money didn't change you, you ain't getting enough
Fuck coppin a car, I'm Tryna fly to the stars
Smooth on the moon and I be mobbing to mars
Niggas say I'm ill, y'all ain't telling me shit
Cuz the nights we was ill, y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh now my money change drastic, The coupe do gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress soon we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish, this got to be magic

If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Pray the lord I rest in peace
If I die before I wake
Please rejoice this song I sing

Assault with deadly weapons, got these rappers feeling threatened
A hip-hop veteran, I'm a hip-hop felon

All my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit
And we came to double up on that Harlem shit
We all eating, this is how it's supposed to go

These days of preference has no complexion
You could be light, dark, mixed or fair skin
Just light the candle
Cold sweats down the handle, life's a gamble
And she know
Love with me is like a casino, outside of Reno
A couple white lines
A cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio
House keys to P.O
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted, high on the West Side Highway
Drunk enough to fuck with, face it

Hangovers, leftovers in the Range Rover
Shame on her, make up or get a makeover
Think over, Glenfiddich start to takeover
When I brainstorm, all the hoes ain't got a thing on her
Audemars, season order like summer fall
I throw the Audemars, then I throw out all the ball
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Little cutie pie, saw her looking super fly
More Justin Timberlake on my suit and tie
Try to scrutinize, cause I keep two inside
Suicides? No sir, hoes get the Uber ride
Or we can kiss 'til the sun come up
Or, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up
She ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge
Girl just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up

On the highway to my place
It's higher than you ever been
By to my way, be all day
Me, you and all your friends
In love, fuckin'
In love, just too much, ohh

Feeling outta place, plus it's getting kinda late
Tryna make it home safe and not get raped, where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffing dope, so her dome is leaning on your rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped your friends
Flag a taxi, now you walking not too far from your crib
Craving for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feeling flabbergasted, you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th Ave, flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid, french braids and he keep the potent
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rolling reefer blowing in the streets he smoking
Blowing weed while police patrolling
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip

Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip

You know what this is
It's a celebration bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab your ass

Bitch I hustle every day, you could check my resumé
Bad Spanish bitch, one kiss'll take your breath away
I could bag your girl in a broken down Chevrolet
Swag do the talkin', I ain't even gotta decorate
I was 21 when I bought my mom a condo
A guitar and a gift card down at Costco's
It's a cold winter when it's blowing past my goggles
Penthouse, top floor, window with the gargoyle
Performance down at Santos, Phantom suicide doors
Paparazzi slide-shows, showers with the slide doors
One night, five shows, two-seater, five hoes
Eyes closed, I can see them hating through the blindfolds
Niggas better switch it if the business ain't the convo
I'm all about my chicken nigga you could call me Roscoe's
If I wasn't spitting I'd be probably flipping waffles
I suppose God knows I coulda been a snot-nose
DAMN

Every night we celebrate, Every night we celebrate

Fuck is all the talk about? Fuck these niggas talking 'bout?
Shit I know it's us cuz we the only thing to talk about
I been down to ATL, I seen how they walk it out
Cali Crip Walk it out, show 'em what New York about
What these niggas hating for? Fuck these niggas hating on?
I'm what they debating for, I'm what they been waiting on
Out there tryna take it slow but taking slow been taking long
Know I'm on the paper trail until I get my paper long
When I'm in the kitchen, catch me with my apron on
And it's back to business, A$AP is where they belong
And we on the grind, that's until I get my paper long
See your nigga's face every time you turn your cable on
Mami why your leggings on, face down ass out?
Tylenol and codeine got a nigga 'bout to pass out
Catch me on a grind and now a nigga 'bout to cash out
Get money, hella cake, every night we celebrate

When the boys roll, pull up on the block
Still we hustle, 'cause we run the spot
I'll be on my grind, every night dawg
'Til the coffin close, and my lights off
I hit 'em up, like my name's Shakur
Count my dividends, I'm allergic to poor
Stack my paper up, I'm above the law
I hit 'em Up

Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's good
Oh shit
Mushrooms, LSD, marijuana
Light that shit

This is every heavy drug, that's known at every level
This assault with deadly metal bumpin' heavy metal
Do this for myself, of course my hood and every ghetto
Paper pushin', paper petal, cause I heavy petal
It's real nigga flowin' through my blood and every vessel
Time is money, so I saved the load on every bezel
I just had a dream, I dipped my watch canary yellow
I woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow
Let go back to business, my fizz product for my narrow
Cause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos
Flaco jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuits
I hypnotized my six, but my .38 was kinda special
What a life this is, what a sight this is
Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white persons
All alike when the lights get dim
On a righteous pass, where you don't look back
Nigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash
Niggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sit

I just had an epic dream like Dr. King
Police brutality was on my TV screen
Harmony, love, drugs and peace is all we need

Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems

Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean

Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this suprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Del Agua
Now I be the man Peter Pan, I fly high cause you like my drift
She know how I do it cause I got possess and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
It don't really matter cause I'm pimping bitch until the end

Hello, it's the Mack, sit back and relax
As we chat on ways to make a couple stacks off your snatch
Hold up, here's the catch, you might have to hit the track
Take a loss, make it back, if you get caught, bitch shut your trap

All my life
I've been waiting for your love
All those nights
I'd been lusting for your touch
Tell that bitch I need money
Bitch I need money
I need money
Tell that bitch I need
Money make the mothafuckin' world go round
No, money make your mothafuckin' girl go downtown

Riding 'round, I'm getting it, two chains on like I'm Tity
Versace shades like I'm Biggie, them twenties, fifties and benjis
These bitches all in my business, I mack 'em then I act stingy
I never slip with my pimping, when I holla come and get with me, huh?
Drizzy, huh? Swizzy, huh? Prada, Gucci and Fendi
Which only means you fancy, my trillest bitches is trendy
She tipsy off of that Crissy, my pimping never been friendly
She fell in love cause I'm pretty, she love me more than her family, huh?

All my life, I've been waiting for your love
All those nights, I'd been lusting for your touch
Tell that Bitch I need

I need new Bape, grandpa need a toupee
Mama need some new weave, get her hair done with new braids
So bitch give me money, stop dicking around like you paid
Heated that grip like today, better hit that strip like today
Better hop in that whip with the coochie, then she lick dick to the new king
Them niggas be balling like 2K, better suck that dick 'til Tuesday
Better get them chips 'fore it's too late, it's a new bad bitch with a booty

What? I ain't tryna fuck, make her, make a buck
Every nigga in the world wanna live it up
Give it, give it up, trill bitch, don't give a fuck
And she get a pimp nigga like me, rich as fuck

Back through the door, bag full of smoke
Sit back, relax and max with the hoes
Chat with my folks, laughin' at jokes
I’m hard to the core and she bad to the bone
Ask her to bone, chats on the phone
Her three friends with her just'a tagging along
As for the flow, back to the song
Flashbacks only bring me back to that thong
Cause we been getting, we’ve been getting high all week
Smoking, drinking, I’m her drug and she get high off me
Now I’m back to the store
Blunt wrapped, full of 'dro
Roll it back in that Backwood
Pass it and smoke
Want to get her high so I pass her the most
She want that bread and butter so I pass her the toast
That A$AP motto is "party, get high"
We back to the future
That Marty McFly

Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future’s always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly

Back through the door, back from the store
Back to the wall with my back to the wall
Rollin' up a blunt, passing it off
Ass on the floor, cash back on the floor
Mack with the broads, chat to the whores
"There go my niggas" dap to my dawgs
I prey on that pussy, chat with the Lord
Seem how it seems like I had it before
I think back, way back ran with my memories
We was getting high, sippin' on Hennessy
Now it's like lean
Thinkin' back seat
Way back riding on something clean, knamean
Twenty-tens
We don't do the teens now it's twenty-eleven
Let me know something take her back to my session
Back to the pad, now I’m back on that ass
Back to the future, back to the past

What it do, baby?
It's Paul Wall, come on

Purple pint, that's Gucci rap
Driving slow, black on black
Backwood lit, windows cracked
Dime in my lap with her hair pulled back
And a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist
Mouth full of ice, pardon my lisp
World full of hate is fear a few rips
So I open my mind and stack up my chips
Lollipop grind, whole lotta licks
From paper planes to a house made of bricks
Big ol' cold cup with codeine mix
So I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit
And everything is purple, baby

Trill OG and I rep the South
Nigga, I rep the streets and I rep the hood
And I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains
And I'm flippin' mane and it's kinda good
I'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it
Hittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it
With a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece
‘Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie
Haters better get they ass behind me, homie
‘Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge
And when I'm done, I'mma have a homie run
And they be hard to find like they's El Debarge
And my swag is large, extra large
I can barely fit it up in this room
But don't sweat the size and don't be surprised
When your bitch reminds that I'm the shit to swoon
I lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro
Spit my game and I smash your ho
But no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough
Then I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro
I got a passion for this Southern flow
This that purple life and we thuggin', bro
These haters might not really understand it
But that's all good ‘cause we love it though
This PAT, that's where I'm from
That's what I rep and that's how it go
I roll with rocks so get up off the jock
From New York to PA, this that purple flow
It's that swag

Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
Robitussin, quit discussin', A$AP tell these niggas somethin')

Ha-ha-yeah
Check, one, two, what it do?
Run it!

Fo's spinnin' like the shit under my wave cap
Just rock it like a nigga named "A$AP"
Fast money man, I get mine ASAP
Always stacking and I'm paid, that's ASAP
Wood grippin', candy drippin'
Four in my 20, I'm candy sippin'
Fill my prescription, I'm leanin', ho
Nightmare cup, I'm dreamin', ho
Trill nigga like Chad and Bun B
Crocodile seats insides, I'm Dundee
Slow that down, Screw, Watts or Ron C
I'm getting rap money but I used to run D
MC, rep, run it
Frank Cyser shit, any beat get punished
Y'all got problems, I get money
So my neck, fist, wrist always look sunny
I stay fresh, y'all niggas look bummy
Cold with the flow, so I ball like Tommy
Martin, I keep a yellow bone like Gina
Thick like Serena, my pockets on Venus, nigga!

I'm who these ladies love, who your main bitch lust for
Mounts of dead presidents, and I ain't talking Rushmore
Codeine and syrup got my safe like the drugstore
Hating niggas, niggas hating, bitches hating -- fuck, boy
She a gold-digger, but who am I to judge her?
We above the law, who am I to cuff her?
It's obvious she want me, mayne
I be swimming in these women, I'm the scuba diver lover
Known around the globe but Harlem's where I be at
Same home as Cam'ron, and I ain't talking Diaz
Flame spitter nigga, guaranteed to get a heat rash
Ballin all seasons, subscribe for your league pass
Rap Simon London, Louis Vuitton Don shits
Christian Louboutain for guys with red bottoms
Yves St. Laurent kicks, Christian Dior sponsors
Thesis snapbacks like I'm straight outta compton
Rick Owens, I own 'em
Margiellas, I did 'em
Y3's, we on it
Alexander, we miss 'im
I'm talking 'bout the king, yes, Alexander McQueen
May he live, rest in peace, and we do it through our jeans

I'm trying to tell 'em I see my future as crystal-clear
Shine like some crystal, yeah, so I keep pistols near
Not far at all, one reach, that's all
You sleep, sleep in the back of some old Ford pickup
On the side of the road
Cold, cold world, no J
No way, Jose
N.A. all day
S.T., that's me
Ask why, and you wonder why my flow go over guys
Who want a horse and drive
But you often find it's coffin time, no Pokemon
Plate still stuffed to the top, but ain't no pork on mine
It's quite often I could come up with Mighty Morphin rhymes
Fool think he fucking with Nast, must have lost his mind
Yeah, you lost your mind, the throne is mine
I watch the throne
Smoking reefer, slightly past my zone
I'll soon be back at home
I'm relaxing, homes
I got the Mac tucked in my jack
I might just act if you ain't acting right
Fuck it, I keep the Magnum
Bust it; niggas don't want it with my niggas, we steady coming
Hundred deep, three hundred we coming like Spartan
Fucker, just pardon my flow
I come through your deli department or market
Nah, check it out
I'm swagging, my niggas with it too
Your bitch with it, I probably just hit her then I'm through
Through, I'm chilling, I'm chilling with the homies
Rolling up a couple Swishers, couple bitches on me
I be chilling, homie
Get the picture? We all around the globe, check the flow on me

I'm sippin' Persian wine with your Persian Dime)
Medusa faceded mogul
Fergenstien too cool too
Hoodlum in these Owen boots
Ricky Owen but I ain't on you
Fuck burnin, I thaw the booth
Nigga I ain't lyin', I told the truth
Lil' kids gone hold the duece
Sip holy water, trynna seek the the truth
Uh, that was just me startin' off...

Man I came to bring the pain
Twelve be spittin' flames
Live from the two twelve with my eight dollar gang
AP, Audemar
Running like a Viking back
It's the grand with the flow, all the hoes be liking that
Recite it back
Run it back
Play it over, play it over
ASAP everything, my young niggas takin' over
Pyrex, baking soda, loud and some roll up
Cookin' up some shit Ty Nast screamin'...

Donatella on speed dial
Diamond teeth when these smile
Triple tounge, Jeremy Scotts
Margiellas on me, nigga no socks
Dropped in a bitch, nigga no pop

What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker

Nowadays it's silly, niggas beef for nothing
The type of shit that make the hippies throw up peace for nothing
Back in my day, there wasn't silencers to hide the 8 up
So if it's beef, be sure to order side of baked potato
I've got amigos on my payroll, Quavo gave me guelo
Fuego, beef up on my plate is no mistake
Hahahahaha, check out the Chopard
For sure, I'm Shakur out the window of my car
Spitting at the cameras and I flood the club with dancers
I used to roll with hammers back when Sway had all the answers
Now it's spread like cancers in this German
And these niggas want me gone for certain
And that's what I call beef, you vermin

Uh, Puffy swag combs, call me Sherlock Stallone
Daddy NASDAQ or call me Puffy Dow Jones
Come fuck with Puffy, dirty money since the scruffy Puffy
They want me bloody, hungry, ugly, crusty, musty Puffy
See that motherfucking phantom? Then it must be Puffy
It's like lately, all the ladies say is "fuck me, Puffy"
80 million records was projected
My leverage breaking records, it's like 80 women naked
Hectic, paranoia got me feeling threatened
So I'm loading up my weapons up like every other second

Hey lady, got something for you to buy now
Something cool, something new, something for you to try now
I know you feel alone, but I'm gon' get you high now
Now that you high, take your clothes off, and lie down

We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping

Come, listen, yeah I can be your E-pill
Better yet your He-pill, when it come to tricking D-pills
She say that my pipe is crack and you know I'm gon' get very ill
So I just penetrate and hit her with my needle
She need ill, to stay alive, keep my crack in between her thighs
When she smoke she feel her high, delicate enough to make her cry

I can be your pusher, know you need your pusher
Get it how live it when you know you need the hook up
I can get it cook up, know I got you shook up, ooh
I'm your pusher, but I don't be on no corners
Put me in your nose, inhale my aroma
Shit so potent, shit stronger than ammonia
O.D. and fuck around and slip into a coma

Used to call me Push ‘cause I pushed by the quarter
Used to push keys ‘til the D's pushed harder
Push “start” – push buttons, start the car up
Push me, push your wig back like barbers
Off with your toupee, I boss hog like two lanes
Fuck red dots but my bullets come in Blu-ray
Pussy-ass niggas and they sweet like Kool-Aid
Married to the game, tell them niggas catch the bouquet
Don’t fuck with hoes, sometimes I’d rather beat off
My kicks so fire, burn the skin up on my feet off
Tell ‘em turn the heat down, they tell me my mink off
She’s so abusive, the boy she wanna skeet off

Fancy, fancy, met her on Delancey
Pum pum so good I eat her through her panties
Every Jamaican bitch always trippin’ off of Xanny
Wine slow, so I give her gold like Santi
Bapes on my feet make the cypher complete
Margielas by the week, say my style is unique
Picking bitches by their teeth, for my bitches be heat
Put the pussy on lock, I remind 'em of sheiks
Cuttin’ niggas with my lines like a barber with Zekes
Burnin’ niggas with my rhymes, let the arsonist speak
I’m tryna have a Nicki Minaj every week
And fuck makin’ her cum, Imma fuck her ‘til she pee
And if she was a midget, I would fuck her on my knees
‘Cause that ass fat, I will fuck her ‘til she sleep
It’s Trap Lord Sunday every day of the week
A-S-A-P ‘til I D-I-E, ma’fucka

Smoking killer grippin' grain
Out my mind I'm so insane
Finest fabrics on my back
Bally kicks, Birkin Jeans

Clean with a dirty swing
Catch me with a bony thing
Louboutin everything
Engaged but no wedding ring
Type of woman I attract
Cheetah print all on the back
Sexy motherfucker you
Love how you be switching that
LA by way of New York
She tell me she love my talk
I tell her I love her walk
The way she bought without a card
Got me 'bout to set it off
Hit a bank up like Latifa, yeah that type of set it off
Favorite show the Commodores, minds is more like entourage
I be playing Vinnie Chase and mama get her Sasha on
Cutting till the break of dawn
Then I'm off, on the road, probably to another show
Different city, newer clothes
Different ho, a different stroke
Fuck you mean I'm gnarly Joe
My old head put me on the game
Keep it pimpin' never fold
So I spit it, here it go

Bally kicks, Birkin jeans

I do the Raf Simons she ain't even head of it
The situation looking flaky then I'm curvin' it
Condo out in Jersey, I ain't even furnished it
That's a sub-lease that lease ain't even permanent
Asap tat is on a nigga permanent
Long hair a nigga might just throw a perm in it
Maserati ridin' catch a nigga swervin' in
I'm moving fast, you can't catch up to my turbulence
Smoking lemon kush, yeah I'm eating good
I see the limit push, and I'ma leave for good
L-lil mama lookin' she heard I eat it good
They call me Hollywood, but I'm a keep it hood
Na-na-now I came down south, niggas know I keep it banging
Good whip, keep it ringing
Keep the wood grain I'm slangin'
4's and tippin' Nothing different
And we on that codeine promethazine the same thing
And it made my nose bleed

Bally Kicks, Birkin jeans

Tippin' on 4's, riding real slow
Everywhere we go, hoes wanna know
Who we are

Bally kicks Birkin Jeans

There was a family of quicks on my block
A family we all knew
I'm talkin' bout John, Damian, and that boy Jrue
They had an unfair proof that lived in their shoe
Technological truth made'em quicker than you
Their quick was quick
I'm talkin bout the quickest quick ever seen
From outside the gym you could hear the crowd scream
Challengers and challenges brung'em to the floor
They cut and crossed over until there wasn't no more
Competition that is
People keep asking you what's up in that shoe
First draft pick, rookie of the year, all star games too
Looking back on the sell homie, who would've even knew
That all of that quick could come from inside of a shoe?
Those kicks made these cats rare
And when you crazy quick, man quick ain't fair

I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress

I'm coming for your neck, hey, I ain't indirect
They in debt, pay respect, now I'm coming to collect
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat
Make a bet that the next time you niggas come correct
This the type of music make a nigga flex
Start so gangster, move it throwing up the set
All the pretty niggas feeling only breasts
And the government are cutting only checks
Everybody stressed

If knowledge is power and power is knowledge
And then you divide and conquer, I devoured and conquered
The youth is my environment, inspire responsibly
But they rather drop it like it's hot, that wobbity wobbity
If you ever thought of robbing me, my mob on me probably
I believe this highway robbery, get the fuck out the driver's seat
Honestly part of the problem, you deprived of your privacy
This is private property, you part of the poverty
You forced just like the prophecy, that's part of the policy
Obviously just plain technology, democracy's mockery
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete
The power of the God in me, no telling what I'mma be

First of all, I would like to start by saying
I'm the motherfucking man, just thought I'd let you niggas know, hear me?
If the shit hit the fan and these rappers start
The pen coming at you niggas' throats, hear me?
Do it big out in Cannes
At the film festival, nigga, every year I go, hear me?
Big dick, that's my man
Keep forty bitches round, bring 'em everywhere I go
Hear me? Hear me? Chilling on a boat
In the south of France, island happened off the coast
Saint-Tropez when I'm waving to the folks
Got the young trap lord with me looking like the Pope, hear me?
Grew up living broke
Before we'd seen it all, niggas had to dream it all
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they feel me
They don't feel me but they feel me, they hear me

Hear me?
Young niggas doing what it takes to survive
Young niggas only pay attention if it's fly
All I ever hope to do is prosper when I strive
If they ain't playing in the game then they hating on the side

Black dark shades, black leather jacket
Bad chick on my arm got me looking like The Fonz, hear me?
We the champions and about to get a ring same size as LeBron's, hear me? Hear me?
Yeah, life is a bitch and it's no holds barred, every man for themselves, hear me? Hear me?
And if you ain't a man and your name ain't Solange
Keep your hands to yourself, hear me?
But I don't know them grown folks' business
The thoughts that they plant like it's photosynthe-sis
In your bits, put their nose all in it
I bring 'em to the light with my photogenics
Hear me? Fuck all those critics
If Flacko on the booth, that mean a killer on the loose, ooh
They don't feel me but they fear me, they hear me

Hear me? Hear me?

Uh, third verse, turn to third gear
I left a couple things out like the third wheel
These niggas lying on tracks without a third rail
Cause yeah, I'm only stating facts when I'm saying on wax
In your ear like I'm cleaning out the wax
They don't hear me like they're deaf, "it was wack", was dirt there?
Hear me? Yes, I gotta talk about the trap
Matter of fact, let me talk about rap cause I've served here
Yeah, hear me? Hear me?
Man, fuck the bullshit cause now I'm in my zone, hear me? Hear me?
I hear the same bullshit in every other song, hear me?
So I try to give 'em something different, listen when I'm on, hear me? Hear me?
Saddest thing about it is they only pay attention and they miss you when you're gone, hear me? Hear me?

Full lyrics available upon release
Oo, oo, oo
Metro Boomin want some more nigga!

I...

Uzi's to blame
Diamonds on chain
Look at the fangs
Vampire Mane
Pants came from Japan
Bitches way up out of France

Woah
But not talking bout no socks

Who is to blame? Diamonds on chain
Look at the jewelry, I did it so beautifully
Niggas can't fuck with me, it's suicide, nigga come scrutinize
I'm with the Metro, she with the Petro
Come with the fellow
She blow like a Cello, said the diamonds is all yellow
Pants on me like a farmer
Ten million under armour
Still do a deal with Nike, then we get cut, not

Stay in yo motherfuckin' lane, get ya'll drip and shit
Stay in your late, okay?
Okay, stay in your motherfuckin'  lane
Y'all ain't even got no money to be me
Y'all keep tryna' fake me
Y'all keep tryna fake me, talking 'bout you for the people
If you don't stay in your lane, dude
Stay in ya'll motherfucking lane
Stay in your lane dude, you fucker

Wrist, where the magic at?
Where the attic at?
Where you hide it at? Where you stash it at?
Gun go rat-a-tat, nigga leave em flat
Fuck these niggas out here, sneakin' n' bein' cats
I don't believe in cats

Believe in cats

Oh, yeah, okay, okay, okay
Hold on, I got the jet lag
Perform in the rain with the Air Mags
Your bitch all on me, 'cause I walk around right with the stacks yeah ooo mmm
Getting the money, I get it right back
That nigga be blacked, just like my Salmon
Uh, What happened? uh, I don't even know, these niggas lyin'
They should be cappin', what no cap?
Bad bitch on me from the what?
Bad bitch on me, I don't want it
Bangin' that hoe right on wax
Pull up just right in the Jeep

I live how I want, I Do What I Want
Huh, what? huh yeah Bad bitch on me, she's like where?
I get the money, I get the lil paper
They look at the shit that I wear
You dig on my dick, and I'm drippin' this
Like dissin' these niggas, they mad that I'm here
Okay my swaggin' so ill
So they try to take it out the air
They try to act just like me
Now your bitch all in my face
Got a condo on condo
Got a crib out in crib
Got your bitch on my dick
Pass that bitch to my bro
She stay on that rib, told that bitch I'mma get it
Put my dick in her ribs
Movin' the shit, smokin' gas not the cig
Your bitch wanna get me
She all on you but you ain't got muscles, you is a twig
I'm gettin' the paper
I don't want that hoe, that's a trick for a treat
Okay

Still rappin', still rappin'
And I look like I'm still trappin'
Other niggas yeah they still cappin'
Niggas ain't have to film nothing
You ain't feel rabid
You ain't feel the wrath of a nigga rockin' RAF
29 Jeans, don't wear a 40
Don't wear no 40, but hold a .40
I fucked her daughter, now she my shorty
Back in the days I blow that haze and drink a 40
These niggas be funny, and they all be dummies
Dummies, Dummies, and they bummy
And my fucking sneakers gummy
And I fuck it put it inna tummy
And her Pussy, yummy yummy
Fucking on it
I'm a fuckin' bastard
I'm a fuckin' savage
Man, I had to have it
I'm a playboi though I stay out the field
With a bad bitch in a vert  headed to the studio
Niggas tryna surpass,  know what I'm sayin?

I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

A$AP, where my crew at
Swag so sick where the birds caught the flu at
All the hoes know me, don't need to ask, "Who that?"
Or where the heat at, my nigga, cause we do that
And pistol popping get it popping, niggas better move that
Cause we get a Glock and with the stock and he ain't scared to shoot it like
I'm the shit, you must admit, true that
Niggas know we get it for the low uptown
Gold, got 'dro, got snow uptown
Bitch-shit niggas scared to go uptown
Money making Manhattan, whip game proper
Them might be the product of the locker
A$AP, know I'm gonna prosper
Don’t care, cause I'm only straight as my posture

Boom, nigga, Nast in the house
Flow like a drug, pass it around
Fag, you're in doubt, what you rapping about?
A$AP nigga, trash on the couch
Glass to the mouth, Patrón in the system
Tool on the waist just in case I gotta fix 'em
Bullets like fiends just dying to hit them
Nigga did I mention, swag house nigga
Get slapped in your shit if you badmouth nigga
Left the Range in the garage and brought the Jag out, nigga
Nast be the shit that you brag about, nigga
I ain't even tryna hear about your hereabouts, nigga
Weird-ass nigga, scared-ass nigga
I'm done with this track, did you hear that, nigga?
Try to step on my throne? Bitch, this is my home

I'm a uptown blood slime, balling's in my blood line
Pants sagging real low, I'm running from the one time
Free Church boy, yeah, my nigga caught a gun crime
Mobbing on Lenox and I'm grinding 'til the sunrise
I'm really getting dope, boy, free my nigga Dough boy
Catch me on Broadway, we got it for the low, boy
And I got flow, boy, in other words, hoes, boy
Body after body, yeah, you already know boy
I'm bumping "Oh Boy", classic Harlem shit
True Religion, who you kidding? Nigga started this
Young Twelv' get it gang, got the hardest shit
Polo down to the socks, looking marvelous
I'm from the home of the free S
I'm Grade on the West like I'm Gucci on the ES
Aura like GS, stepping out the GX

I daydream pretty women out in Beijing
Paris Celine hop up in that Saline
I chase dreams, white man but the face green
Same thing 'err day, 'err thing gleam
Fuck my reply, the bank do the statements
Had me with my savings, I was saving in my savings
Two or three bedroom shack I was raised in
The condos out in Jersey full of Jay West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk to the Lord
Talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
Marc Jacob plates, Margiela rugs
My boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out the first class, hop into that E-class
Cut raw, cut school, I ain't ever see class
If so, I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class
School of hard knocks, graduated with a G pass
G-Code, Street code, fake niggas; cheat code
I dont know how they do it for the freak show
But I ain't even go beast mode
So we toast

Fuck the pearly gates, I'm hanging by the steps
Cause my target is my goal and I'm aiming for the best
I'm good at what I do, but I'm coming for the best spot
On the road to greatness, success is the next stop
I toast with the Gods, tell these haters take they best shot
I'mma be that motherfucker 'till my breath stop
I guess for now call me step pop

We toast for the night and drink for the day
The god shed a tear providing us rain
What a shame from the pain cause we used to being slaves
Made a change from the whips, shackles and the chains
But nowadays man seem a little strange
Trade his soul for the whips and the chains, what a change!
No, I couldn't tell you what the difference is
But I could tell you what the business is
I was getting dividends, probably spending Benjamins
Both kind of synonyms, in the same sentences
Tell me what a good Christian is
Better yet; When Christmas is
Waiting on my presence, I must be a gift from heaven
Cause im toasting with the Lord, somebody let the bitches in

We use to wear rugged boots now it's all tailored suits
Audemars piguets for my criminal recruits
Partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Riding by the rules i'll abide by it soon
Know you live by the gun then you die by it too
White on white wagon call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass nigga, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunning yea I'm about my guapanese
Shoe game serious so serious, bop her knees
Niggas say I'm blessed my bad I forgot to sneeze
They your reasons though bitch

She just started to pop it for ??? in the back and tell me baby I'm trill
I started to smack it and enjoy it and I'm lovin' the way that it feel
Chilling it with Westwood
And you know she like to get me cause I sex good
After that, we go in London town and shut it down
All my UGK the kings of the underground
Rollie and parolees, and parolees wanna stroll me
Woly woly holy, woah camoly bitches blow me
Niggas do all my dirt by my lonely, and you tony
You phony Toni baloney, I'm pimpin' macaroni
I swear, Sony, play em like a Playstation
Niggas think they taint hatin', I don't give a fuck I stay makin'
Don't let that tec, hit you in yo neck, came for that respect
Gimme the check, with some set bitches, all dank on that debt
And they sipping and they drinking on that nectar
Swear I get these bitches with the heckler
And I'm chilling with my nigga Westa
Tim Westwood from the Westwood
And I come through in your neck woods
In your neck of the woods, in the neck of the hood, in naked goods
And they givin' me goods on my wood

Marble floors, foreign whores, finna order more
Ordered new Raf, it ain't from the store
Came with a piece, bangin' peace if it come to war
She takin' somethin' off, what you stuntin' for?
Fix your WonderBra, my style is rubbin' off
Swear that pussy Oasis if I'm in it raw
Out in London Town paintin' all the wonderwalls
Yeah I'm underdog, spring, summer, fall, winter
Niggas run to law, gun in drawers, gettin' bundles off
Takin' trips to Baltimore, with the raw, door to door
Fender boss, want the vintage Porsche with the oven doors
I just wanna have a little fun with y'all
But on the real, no, I kill folk
Growin' up I had a best friend who used to mail coke
Successful with the shit until the day they heard the seal broke
My other partner got a million dollars and he's still broke
My thot a primadonna and she whinin' cause her nail broke
Niggas comin' at me sideways like they heel broke
And I'm just glad I ain't ever gotta deal dope
Cause the vision was this tradition and pants
Whole squad in this bitch, all we missin' is Yams

Caught a wish and got bitches in France
Chain swing, see the king and they kissin' my hand

I want a brand new house
I want a foreign lil bitch
She put it all in her mouth
I want it so I'ma go get it

I want to rock the designer
I want to whip a recliner
I want to some business in Ghana
I want some bitches from China
I need that watch with the diamonds
House on the hill with the garden
Car with a kit that be shiny
So I can make out with my goddess
She want to fuck on the team
I want some cookies and cream
I want to fly to Belize
I want a hoe from Beijing
I got some Pi's in my jeans
Got that LSD on my spleen
Why are you killing my vibe?
Why you are blowing my high?
Why is this hoe still alive?
I kidnap pussy and dye it
Who know me I'mma go riot
I drive that pussy like bike
I want it some I'mma got it
She want it she had to come get it
I gave her that dick and she split it
I'ma go hit it

Ball so hard mother f'ers wanna rob me
First f'ers gotta rob me
And you better come through with the police department and the army
Don't give a F, cause I got the vest on my chest
And I'm not superman but I step when I through to the death
And I rep to the death better step to the left
Yes, yes what I do I'm fresh fresh, fresh to death
I'm the best when I dress, dress, dress to impress
What you say, you at left, and I put it to the tec
To your brain to the right of your dome blow your brain to the left
POP, POW don't give a damn and I came through the town
London town came to shut it down, king of the underground
Rolex on my left arm, - on my right arm
Got your -itch on my right and we party all night
Last night I was with Trapstar and you know we party hard
And you know we had some laughs, couple giggles hearty har
Don't give a F about these chicks
Tell 'em suck a "ehhh" cause they on my tip
What you mean I flip, I flip, my watch tick tick, and she tick and tick
You don't wanna get in trip, you don't wanna mix with this
I will fight you, I don't like you, get like lightening what you mean?
And you know I come through in that super six, it sit so clean
On your TV screen, it's a dream
I can't hear nothing, turn it up 'til I scream
Where the volume at, put it to the max
Need to hear that bounce, bring it back

Yeah, yo
Yo, yo, yo, uh uh
I'm a pretty motherfucker
Comin' from Harlem
New York City

Yea I'm getting dirty money, but my hands clean
Making money stretch, Ben Frank pull a ham string
Another get rich quick hair brain scheme
Just so we can shine like sterling
Time goes on, consider me the new guy
Walking in the office, brief case and a new tie

Shit change mane, act yo age not your shoe size
Last of the dying breed, the game got her tubes tied
Niggas selling true lies, I'm all about the mula
Stressful, so every now and then I gotta woo sah
Bout to turn it up, see I'm hot as fuckin' July
Smooth suede shoes, I'm Busta Rhymes yelling "Woo Hah!!!"!
Snacks on the menu, it's best we continue
ASAP turn up events in the venue
And these fucking critics do their best to offend you
They don't care about your dress, and your veteran credentials
Motherfuck em' all, motherfuck em' all
We only shop boutiques, like motherfuck a mall
And I'm bright as stars, fresh as death in these McQueens
My outfit is deceased, Alexander rest in peace and I'm Gone

Bachelor with no tux, still got my shirt cuffed
Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked

Niggas get shy when that camera rolls
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
All-yellow Phantom, I'm like Yeezy in that amber Rolls
"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha," but who am I kidding?
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretending
How these gold diggers digging without a single pot to piss in?
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision, I'm grown

I don't do kid stuff much
Niggas say, "Now, nigga all grown up"
I don't hear y'all much
I'm all grown up, tough luck

Curtains drawn and six dudes back
The chauffeur ride in the front as we speed to the dot
Deanna waits along with the classy mist
My waist my shoulder blades the type you can't resist
Bamas don't understand how I'm swift
Or I'm MJ-nice, like Jordan up on the mic
Amen for the new saviors of rap
My birth's 3/89 but I'm 30 up on the track
That's grown man, little homie, that's real rap
Y'all trying to switch up the style, I'm bringing Versace back
Giovanni, Medusa, and all black
Hot boy, I done ran through hell and walked back
Passport is stamped from sightseeing the map
And to think, I'm asleep but won't blink

And chances aren't given,you know you gotta earn em
And you do that by loyalty and hard working
Life is like a movie,until they close the curtains
I'm always being tested,and I don't know the subject
And I don't have a teacher,but I feel so instructed
Sometimes I wonder,if it's all for nothing
Cause the road to success is always under construction
Uh,just the way of life,I pray at night
And I'm shining bright,just like a ray of light

Fuck that nigga I split your unit
Niggas gonna have to go and switch their unit
Pause, it's full of hoes so I kissed the unit
Hold up listen, look at how I just dissed the unit

Looking in your eyes, I can tell you 'gone see
Things you desire, you can settle off greed
But it doesn't really matter to me

Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes

How you livin', bo' I'm livin' good

Got an old school Chevy with a styrofoam cup
Got a mouth full of gold, got a pocket full of hoes
Got a closet full of clothes, rocky my jewelry with no stones
I be gettin' gold, I be, I be, gettin' throwed

Tell these bitches "hit the floor"
Queen-ass nigga, pretty, pretty, motherfucker
Pop that fucking pussy, show it, show it, to these motherfuckers
When the fat lady sings that means the show's over
So I'm leanin' 'till I'm fallin' over, uhh

London town, I came to shut it down
I'm the king of the underground they call me A$AP Rocky baby
Let's do it! Oh we 'bout to spit for real
I be that trill kid, that pretty mother fucka you know
Worry about who hot, talk about who hotter
Harlem globetrotter, his shirt stay Margia
Black harry potter, couldn't get with me like your father
Green coop looking like guava
Couldn't get with me, look its Spike Lee on the scene
And I'm balling out of my league
Camoflauge on cause I came up fly guys
So I do dirty money, hand sanitize fries
What's that you eating? Throw some salt on it
You know they like pigs throw the pork on it
And I see them in the road throw a fork on it
And I, rest in peace throw the corpse on it
I can floss on it word to ?
And I stick them in the gutter and I get at your lil brother
Never start a ? coming at your mother
And you know me and A$AP we gon' just ride for each other
What's up?
Like a goblin, tell them keep slobbin' on my knobbin'
I don't give a damn because I'm mobbin'
With my crew came down to London town, shut it down
Give me the crown I got the sound, whatever
I come through with the lever and I hit you with the mother effer
And you know I'm like a marksman with the Glock 10 and I put it to your cartman
And I bring it to your door, give it to you raw
ODB, shimmy shimmy shimmy ya ooh!
And my hat say "calm the f down"
Came to London town, came to shut it down
This is off of the tippity top and the dome and I'm comin'
Im creamin' and niggas know that I singin it and I come through in it
Got these niggas singing it oh!
No curses on the verses whats worse?
Put them in the hurst, bad bitch red skirt
You know that she flirt, I'm smoking on that purp
And I like that purple drank, I would put you in the dirt
Never talk never chirp, use a bird
Don't want it with me kick them chickens to the curb
Girls got nerve and the fiends got served
And you know the D's on me cause the D's got served, word? Ok
This is off of the top and
A$AP Rocky came off of the block
Bandana around my neck, money signs on the grinding
You already know Harlem world we shining
I day dream pretty women out in Beijing
Paris say ling hop up in the saline
I chase dreams, man white but the face green
Same thing everyday, everything green
F my reply, ? through the statements
Help me with my statements, I was saving in my savings
From a three bedroom shack I was raised in, the condos out in Jersey full of J. West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk the lord, talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
? plates, Margiella rugs, my boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out of first class, hop into that E-Class
Cut raw cut school I ain't ever see class
If so I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class
School of hard knocks graduated with a G Pass
G Code, Street Code, Fake niggas, cheat codes
Niggas trying to turn fake shit green cheap gold
I don't know how they do it for the freak shows
But I ain't gonna be smoked, so we toast
A$AP, A$AP
Yo we could do this all day alright?
Yo I could do it all day I could keep going man
Let me know whats up
Keep doing your thing!
Yo I'm on to the next-ist, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game treat you niggas like my step-kids
Pull up in the Porsche, niggas feel nausea
Just crashed the Range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in my penthouse
Slackin' on your mackin' and I'm bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louis Vuitton red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fitted
Pull up to these shows and these hoes know to get in
Little do she know I got a big ego
On the next and gotta order a protection
Killin' feelin' all these records so my charges is molesting
And assault with deadly weapons so these rappers feeling threatened
They the hip hop patron, I'm a hip hop felon

The A$AP Mob leader explained himself to The Stashed, detailing what happened that night

TO BE FULLY TRANSCRIBED UPON RELEASE

I see things in my sleep
I'm on a cloud

I think they runnin' out of rappers to compare me with
Ain't a bitch out bad enough to pair me with

My jewelry dance like rubies skipping on canary bricks
On some donkey shit, nigga I bought me this
Shooters love me from Canal up to 40th

Yea, that's us
And we don't fuck around, we just get the money and we come on up
We keep it laid back, niggas try to play with us
But they can't stay with us, but they bitches lay with us
We keep in the cut, make this shit move right
I keep this shit groovin' because I proved mines
A long time ago, when I was young yo
I'm just a MC trynna' get my flow yo
And when I got it right
I mean I got it tight
My shit blew up like the motherfucking satellite
I had people trynna' take pictures of me
Bitches wanna' lay down, they say they wanna' love me
Niggas wanna hug me
They mothers wanna hug me
Really didn't matter cuz' you niggas couldn't budge me
I'm the coldest when it comes to this freestyle
I'm big Snoop Dogg, yes I'm the G style
And you can open up the book and check my G-Files
I'm just floatin' on the water like a sea style
But let me give it to you niggas so you know the truth
It's Snoopy D-O-double G I'm spittin' in the booth
I'm sittin' back with my nigga Rocky cuz' he cool
And we gon' do this shit and take you niggas back to school
See I'm a fool when it comes to droppin' cold rhymes

Get money then niggas plan to rob you in an instant
Trigger finger itchin', poppin' you for fidgetin'

Fresh clothes and Versace shoes with the stretched toes

My bitch whole neck gold it's full of them X-O's

Got my game up to Versace and Richmond
John Richmond shoes with the matching rich pants
When's the last time you've seen a grown man wearing pants nigga?

Chicken noodle soup it got the crews in a rampage
Some niggas front blow when nobody watchin'
They be at home in the mirror tone woppin'

Bitches don't sweat me now... Even though ya' been doin' it, haha...

Think about the smarts, words said of wise
Do it like paz and I do it like naz
You got 2 small fries by the size
And I get a gat, 2 times, 2 times, rap
Ratatat on your motherfucking.. back
Niggas know how I do it, asap
Gold chains, bitches give me brain
And I’m insane in the membrane man
Niggas bring pain and I might make it rain
I’m talking bout bullets I ain’t talking bout change
Oh shit, they whole style changed
They was looking at me, now they don’t rap the same

This is off the tip of the top of the dome
When I’m rapping miles deep
In the back, and you know I’m asaping
Pants sagging, and I come through hop the band wagon
Cause they love how I do it
I ain’t never been no faggot
And I gotta habit, tat off this habit

With this stainless
I’m on the same shit, that gang bang shit
Niggas who I hang with, is my crew
And I do, do the do, what it do
Chilling with Raheem, and I come through, with the high beam
And I’m sitting on that lean, and I got 2 bad bitches
But you can call them Siamese
Niggas know my name, niggas know the name
Asap, Ant tell them what it is mane

I said flow like the ocean, sour weed potent
White girl actress, we fucking on saturn
Henny got me blacking
Roller bands stunting, billboard fronting
Free clothes for nothing
Fire plate orange car glowing like a pumpkin
Low behind wheel, bucket hats hell
See you hundred horses, do it for the pleasure
Higher than a feather, coke that I measure
Put it on your tongue, it get no better
Flying over dodgers, chilling with the lowers
African soul, black diamonds boy
Got it from the source, be by the cake
I’m a boss, never take a loss

Who shot them, red dot them
If I spot them, Raheem Duvaughn
You can call em Raheem dot them
Cause he hit them with the beam not mean
Sitting on the top, looking at the.. top
Of the throne, better watch it
Keep your hand out my pocket, your crew
And you say I chew, so I bless you

You could call it special
And I might hit you with the tec tec 2

A$AP Rocky Talks to VIBE About His 'ALLA' Album
PitchforkConsequences Of SoundRollingStoneLos Angeles TimesBillboardComplexTelegraphMetacriticThe Needle DropDead End Hip HopSpectrum PulseBMOC TV

I think back to when pockets packin lint

Yeah, last track on the mixtape
'Preciate everybody listening, you know what I'm talkin' bout?
And we'll see you on the next one, you know what I'm talkin bout?

You know, growin' up... I had this beat stuck in my head
Just no matter what I could never get it out
I guess when you're young, you can be anything you wanna choose

Hey kid you want an autograph?
Cool? Gimme down!

But as you get older all of those options start to narrow
And before you know it every choice you made comes with a consequence
And whenever shit got rough... this beat was always there
But one day man... it just stopped
My brother moved on but...
Beat came back, passing through every vein in my body
You know, my older brother Ricky
Is responsible for me growin' up and having a real job

Com'on Rocky! Just go for it! Just rap!

A$AP, A$AP, A$AP...!!!

Retire all my hoodie wrap for all my suits lately
I'm twenty-six, but I've been livin' in my youth lately
Pour my wisdom, but I'll still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what's a blood clot?
All I got's my word and my balls
And my one cock, pause
Buck shots fly, my young buck died
He passed away from a straight from some fake tough guy
Now, this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Dry your eyes, older sis held 'em close
Watch 'em twitch, gave 'em kiss
In the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip or call it quits

Me, bitch I’m me, I'm the goddamn reason you ain't VIP CEO
I’m young wild and strapped like Charlie

Catch me posted on 1 40 if you’re…
My … is all about the buisness
But tell me what’s for dinner, y’all niggas is beginners
You fucking with them losers and my team full of winners
D’s on that bitch, we never ride spinners
My birds down south even if it ain’t winter
And I’m a skinny nigga, but to see if my show’s real
Walk to the club, ugly mug like hell rell
Mike’s in my palm on my arm like ll
I’ma put the city on my back like…
King kong in the trunk beat you 12-12
That’s a 12 gauge handed by the 12th grade
And I’m from Harlem so you know we fly high
Buckle up ma you rollin' with a fly guy, cause

Bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me
I’m ceo, I’m ceo

It's so easy to fall in love

Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
ASAP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how

Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Tesla roadster, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get a nigga chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her

A$AP ROCKY FREESTYLE

Don't do this

A$AP and Matis yo you got this!

Now that's freestyllin 101
Mazel tov! -

Psycho, psychopathic man, loaded ammunition in his hand
They froze, he blows, blows...
Another lost soul from the city full of lost hope, where they go, who knows?
But I could bet my bottom dollar
It was over somethin' like money, cash, hoes, they clothes
Down to my last penny heaven won't accept his soul

Man I hate refs always eating up the bagels
I say "hi hater," shoutout to Mano

Fuck you him, burglar bruh
Trill cat shit, take a cat nap
Make her pussy take a cat skin
I don't really know a difference

I said I'm on to that next shit
You lookin' at the bestest
Married to the game
Treat you niggas like my step-kids
Pull up in that Porsche, niggas feel nausea
Didn't write the rules, but my status like the arthur
Just crashed the Range, so I pull the Bent out
Prolly gettin' brains, chillin' in my Penthouse
Slackin' on ya mackin', and I'm bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin, red bottom come in men's now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fit in
Said they like my fitted clothes, down to my split ends
Automatic weapon, need to order a protection
Killing feelings on these records
So my charges, is molesting
Assault with deadly weapon got these rappers feeling threatened
Ain't a hip hop veteran I'm a hip hop felon

I need a crib by the mountain
Chest look house lit
Limbs get frostbit
Brand new outfit
If you less fortunate
You really ain't about shit
So much cribs a nigga friends got to house sit
So much money can't weigh it by the ounce shit
Weigh it by the pound shit
Too much to count shit
Paparazzi taking pictures newspaper topics
Magazines gossip, villa in the tropics
Rockstar pop shit, made by toxic
Inside hot pink outside gothic
Rag-top roof made of fishnet stockings
Black candy paint, look fingernail polish

No one in this sight has Swag like I do
Hit em with the rifle, I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower
Hustle harder, snow, sleet, shower
Age worry about who's hot who's hotter
Like crabs in the barrel tryna pull you to the bottom
You get em I got em
Point him out, I stop em
Red dot em I shot em
I hot em, you find him
Roll to the club and I order gold bottles
Shawty get low, but I'm no flo-rida
And this 6-4 spokes like a lowrider
The coups so special you could call it mo-rida
But I'm a known rider, and I'm a provider
Black on black Bent, fire, like the Ghost Rider
Don't need a ghostwriter
Because my flow's tighter
Your careers nose diving
I'mma pull an allnighter
So hood rich hollywood bitch want me
Don't look hood but a hood bitch love me
Hood niggas hate Hollywood niggas hate me
Prolly why I never keep the burner off safety
You could never ugh, you should never try to play me
On a scale of One to Ten, so sick is what they rate me
No homo, but these labels wanna rate me
I tell em four words
Fuck You Pay Me

First off, shift off, get high, lift off
Sold models, look at the gold bottles, thought it was crystal
But after that I’m like chris cross
Jump, jump, got the funk, got it packed
What you want? Leave you slumpted
Know me, I’m a leaker, got the sneaker
See a diva, and she painting, for a feature
I don’t care, I carry pick wards, and you wanna mess
Hit you up, with the twizzer
Listen, jesus skizer, I be heating with a breezer
Never had to leave her, and I leave her at my leisure
I hit you with a twizzer, sorry gotta go, it was nice to meet you
Chill, ah hahahaha

Motherfucker's dead
Everything is a go, even a cop or a fed
Married to your head, cartel from japan
Niggas don't understand I'm the motherfuckin' man
Watchu say?
Whatchu say? Whatchu say?
I'm a motherfuckin' savage
Drug Cartel and they came with a tactic
Money and the mattress
Money and the attics
Niggas are addicted
Heard they got that...

They ain't fucking with my clique
My clique, my clique, my clique
And bitches on my dick
Because I'm on the shit
I'm a pimp, a pimp, a pimp, a pimp
You can tell it by the limb
I'm eating steak and shrimps
Now, look at this nigga comin' down the road with the hoes
Goes up in his clothes
And you know I do it I suppose
Bitches love my name
And I come through with a Rove'
'Cause I'm so fly but they call my god like I'm Hov'
Oh, now we in Miami with my family
Got a bad bitch named Sandy in her panties
'Cause she wanna get with me and the Henny in the Hemi
Got it in the jenny, bitches wanna get that Jimmy
'Cause they fucking with me 'cause I got them smoking all that Britney
On that Whitney or that Bobby
So Rappin' is my hobby

'Cause they talking bout Rocky
They tryna catch a body
