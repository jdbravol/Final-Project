[Hook 1]
Take me to the truth
Take me home with you
Change my taste in music
(I'm fallen) Make me rise with you
(She likes me) I'm surprised you do

[Verse 1]
Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah
And my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy
Vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy
Reading bell hooks, she just sayin'

[Hook 2]
I'm surprised you do (baby)
I won't lie to you (I love you)
I'm your guy who's new
Hide me from the blue
I'm dying on the moon
And I just needed you

[Verse 2]
Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles
But that is just what makes you beautiful
Like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby
Why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, O.M.G, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine
And leave them on the sofa
I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa
Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa
Chance of finding you, one in a hundred thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa

[Hook 3]
Spend some time with you
I might bend the rules
Cause I'm in love with you
You can see the truth
I will show you soon
Just meet me on the moon

[Verse 3]
She said, "love is a strong word"
Said, "love is a strong word"
Well I'mma sing it for you baby, I'll be your song bird
If we don't have no loving
How we supposed to move on, word?
Heard a brother just got shot
Because he stopped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move on, word
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your song bird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

[Hook 4]
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
Girl, I love you too
I will see you soon
Your homework is due

[Outro - Album Version]
Syre, do you remember?
What's the difference from the future and the past
Just seen Batman, Lex Luther, drag racing in the Jag-uar
Started floating through the valley
Of the city of the angel scraping cash
Now I'm bleeding on the people
I forget that I still got an open gash
I'm the realest kid you never had baby
I won't lie to you, my pride dies with you



[Hook: Jaden Smith]
Man, I'm PCH cruising
My girl she snoozing
She was all night boozing
No love, here to be losing
I don't care who's in
The car cause really
Really we just PCH cruising
My girl snoozing
She was all night boozing
No love, here to be losing
I don't care who's in
The car cause really
Really we just PCH cruising

[Willow Smith]
We just PCH, PCH, PCH, PCH driving
We're the crazy kids, rebel kids, saddened kids, wild kids, lonely kids

[Willow Smith]
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby

[Hook]

[Willow Smith]
You can come and cry if you come through
You can hug the sky if you want to
You can come and cry if you come through
You can hug the sky if you want to
Cause you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And the moon is full, moon is full, moon is full, moon is full

[Willow Smith]
We just PCH, PCH, PCH, PCH driving
We're the crazy kids, rebel kids, saddened kids, wild kids, lonely kids

[Willow Smith] x 4
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby

[Hook]

[Outro: Jaden Smith] x 2
Baby you can be my catfish
I never see you I just text you on the phone
And you look just like that actress
What's the name?
I'm afraid that if I see I'm freakin' suffocate
Or do a backflip
Yeah, I'm knocking at your door
But I died so they put me in a casket
People say Jay your just over-reacting
But your like the girl that I never had
You're my catfish



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse]
Batman, Batman, Batman, Joker just put me on acid
Huh, you on the wave like a Maverick, you need to make something happen
Batman, Batman, Batman, please put me on new fashion
Huh, I ain't learn nothing since last year, you got the renegade fabrics
Batman, Batman, Batman, please put me up on a Tesla (skrrt!)
I'm tryna be hella extra, please hand-me-down a new sweatshirt
Batman, Batman, Batman, heard that you ain't got a mattress
Heard that you king of Manhattan (Queens) so why you stay in the 'Basas?
Batman, Batman, Batman, we need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war, watch out, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman, I heard you married a Porsche
That shit is all in the past, plus we got very divorced
You ain't ready for the war, Skywalker with the force
1, 2, 3, 4, D'artiste is making noise
In the suburbs with the boys, on a roll, no Royce
Had to save the day every single way, we don't really got a choice
Batman, Batman, Batman, please save the day from the demons
I was sipping, he was leaning, we drove right into a precinct
Batman, Batman, Batman, why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell, but this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman, so fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help
Shooting up on Skid Row, out your window look and you could tell
Get it from under their spell, if I don't do it, then who else?
Need me to shoot up the signal
I'll be there to get the info, skrrtin' through the residential (skrrt!)
I wish it wasn't plain and simple
Lemme pull up to the party, need like 35 credentials
Batman, Batman, Batman, why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell, but this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman, we need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war, hold up, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman, so fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help
Batman, Batman, Batman, that was not part of the deal
You was protecting the bank and then you walked off with a mil'

[Chorus: Willow Smith & Pia Mia]
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

[Verse 1: Willow Smith & Pia Mia]
Why do I cry at night still?
Can't sleep without the NyQuil
Stressed out because we fight
Will we ever get this right?

[Chorus: Willow Smith, Pia Mia & Jaden Smith]
'Cause thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man (no more)
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand (so lay me)

[Verse 2: Willow Smith, Pia Mia & Jaden Smith]
So lay me down in Eden under stars
And show me why it's us that he will choose (take me home, take me home)
If happy, I would die here in your arms
Don't cry because the ocean makes me blue
So blue, so blue

[Bridge: Willow Smith]
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue
(Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze)

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Well lately baby, I don't give a fuck
I'm sick of kissing up, I used to miss us taking pics and kissing
Now you miss the club, I pull my zipper up
Start to think "Wait, is this it for us?"—Nah
'Cause I fell for you
See I'm the living Icarus, relationships and scars
I'm lookin' around and girl what happened to me?
(What happened? What happened? What happened?)
They hate on me now but soon I'll be winning
And plaque after plaque, you will see it
And they mad at my accuracy
But my swaggy flow can't even rap to the beat
Better pass it to the chief, world is tragic and deceased
Cops selling crack in the street
But you look like the law
I know I broke your heart but I loved you from the start
Baby tell me all your secrets, baby you know this is hard
When I'm crying in your arms, staring at the stars, it's my

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
I knew that there would come a day, when you would wanna
You-you would wanna, you-you would wanna run away
Take you to a sunny place
Girl, follow me into the ocean



[Produced by Daniel D'artiste]

[Verse]
All you jokers think I'm tripping better think again
He's a cool guy, pool side—got a, nice ride, far sighted
Car ignited, too excited and I don't sink in it (No!)
He just tryna make the pain go away
Make the fame go away
Cause it's all about now, right now
No past, no future, Lex Luther (Ow!)
But if you got a pass, get up on the stage now
Right now, we dance to the music
It's crazy cause all of them sound so the same
You driving them places, you changing them faces
They all know your name right now
Do I look like Scarface?
We should go far away, function on Broadway
I ain't get your call today, ain't get your call today
They say I'm famous, it's hard to say
Look at the carpet, it's bargain day
That's why I hate when you talk to me
Slurring my words, girl it's burgundy
I know that all of you heard of me
I be that kid that just speaks with his certainty
I got this jewelry on purposely
Just so you know when you work with me
Things can come down in a flurry, see
The cycles, the cycles, I stay on the high note
Just turn on the, turn on the Tycho please
Just came out of cryofreeze
Teeth are bright white so that night can see
Come and get hype with me
Come and get hype with me
Private society, blind, but you try to see
Handle it privately, why did you lie to me?
Why did you, Bruce Lee? John F. Kennedy? (Who?)
Baby girl, just know your enemies (Who?)
Baby girl, make sure you 'member me (Who?)
When I'm not gon' waste my energy
I'm not gon' waste my inner chi
Tryna finish me, kill a joker with my imagery
The government will not be killing me
No, the government will not be killing me
So I'ma bet pounds right now
That if a tree fell down and no one was around
You think that it would even make it sound?
Would it even touch the ground, baby?
Is Galileo in the town?
Find 'em hanging by a string, baby
Tell me what you think, baby, 'ish is going down
In my mind, I am the king
I'll turn everything to pink, baby
Don't you make a sound, no, no
Come and kick it in the sink
Help me wash my cuban links
I've been here before, I think?



[Intro: Jaden] x2
Don't tell me you cried cause I know that you didn't
Don't tell me you love me, I know I'm just trippin'
Cause you tore down my ego, and I listened
Why did I... listen?

[Verse 1: Jaden]
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she had her own fella and I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a wholesaler and I'm fly as propellers
Man it's rainin' umbrellas
Tati went to go and find Stella
Teo went to get Bella, now we waitin' in the cellar
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
Cause I grabbed your hand in a blur
I saw that he's insecure, he's the one with the MSFTS shirt
With the eyes
And your eyes are lookin' at me with such a deep surprise
Baby girl I can see under all them lies
I can see under all them lies
(She's gonna try to kiss you, Jaden)
Well I'll suffocate if she tries
And I'll hold her tight if she cries
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she has her own fella but I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a wholesaler and I'm fly as propellers
Man it's rainin' umbrellas
Tati went to go and find Stella
Teo went to get Bella, now we waitin' in the cellar

[Refrain: Jaden x5]
I hope your man doesn't get jealous

[Bridge: Willow & Jaden]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat, I’ll go
To the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean...

[Interlude: Jaden/Willow]
Don't tell the police, don't tell the police
I fell in the crease of reality and blood on my fleece
My head is in peace, says look at the height that we reached
We're like some whales but we should tan on a beach
Well that sounds awesome to me
Magnetics, the magnetics
(I hate myself for hurting you)
(But I love you, and you know that)
(I don't need to explain myself)
The secret Halloween
(They know this)
I'll dream of you
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden, so many times)
You'll dream of me too
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden, and dream of him)
Your hands there on my face
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden)
There will be no better place

[Verse 2: Jaden]
I know it's not my place to say I love you, but who's it up to?
Alice went down the hole an hour ago and she's in trouble
I should be down on the double, hurry up homies let's huddle
How do you manage being so humble and try not to fumble
And stumble and stumble and stumble
Ricki-ticki and tumble
Like we was in college, I'm sorry, I'ma be with them bumble of bees
It's cold, so baby we should probably cuddle
Put your arms in a bundle, my lips on your neck but it's subtle
Your father won't notice, he's way too busy yellin' at coaches
That college football got him wrapped up, bet it all on the Trojans
I wrote you some notes, they're atrocious
Hope that you don't expose us
Man your love is my narcotic and I double my dosage
I needed a mother figure and girl I guess you're the closest
Girl your body's my ocean, head lay on your chest when I wrote this
And I told you they'd kill us and girl the way that you choked
Was just so emotional that I wish that my mouth never opened
And girl I hope you know that no society or a cult
Can take me away from you, you're the orange juice to my pulp
And girl I'ma say to you, I just wanna grope and elope
But I stay away from you, cause everybody knows I'm a ghost
But I can still dream
I can still dream, I can still...
I can still dream, I can...
I can still dream, I can still dream
As long as I can dream... As long as I dream



[Intro]
We’re gonna jump right into this one...
Checka, uh-huh uh-huh
Whecka, wh-wha, checka—bucka!

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
What’s a heart broken?
You see her and you start choking
A dark open room, will Tony Stark open the door?
Hoping, he’ll take you out of this mess
Ain’t no way that you gon' live another day with this stress
But God bless, you walk and talking and you got flesh
You so fresh, you heal the world with singular steps
I got next, I don’t need to talk to my reps
My Star Trek’s lastin forever, I’m breathing like the weather
Me and you together, these are bonds I’d never sever
I am James Bond, what’s going on? It’s very clever
Top secret, drug bust, the cops keep it
The streets weepin, and the ones at the top see it
Grey cement, tree saps seeping the baby teething
That’s the city on the weekend—screw the planet, leave it
Interstellar, before I was into Stella
Into hella Odd Future videos before I had a Vimeo
Four hours in the city with my bros, wearing silly clothes
This how the story goes
You know I’m gonna tell you all the truth
That’s why we inspire the youth, that’s why it’s so important
That’s why I said no to those endorsements
That’s why I let my friends buy the Porsches cause people at our doors hiding out in Trojan horses
That’s why we got these torches, last thing I want is corpses
But the thing that really bothers me is when these Corvettes
Pull up to my doorstep and tell me something corporate
About my dang foreskin—man, shut up
My family’s not a circus
I told my dad to move the whole tribe down to Europe
Where there’s less Siri and a little more syrup
Maybe the doctors there'll know how to cure us
Maybe they are less serious, maybe they’re different
Maybe they don’t think we’re delirious
We’ll be close to the pyramids, we'll make a stop at Giza
Until they say we need you to renew all of your visas
‘Wait dad, you told me we were born on planet Earth'
My dad said, "To beat the system, understand it first"
My dad’s an inspiration, I respect the man at work
And everything you say is something that you can’t reverse
Something that you can’t rehearse
Someone that you can’t converse with
Like your clean pressed shirt, mess it up; wasn’t on purpose
I am a rhythm surgeon, sorry I am insurgent
Divergent; Zoë get on the phone, it’s urgent
No furnishing in the crib, just burning my fists
Tryna figure out what life is, I didn’t write this
How do you like my high kick, pass me the ball, I’ll spike it
Really likin this nitrous oxide, give it to me until i’m cockeyed
Got my spinach now I’m feelin like I’m Popeye or Pappy
I don’t know, get at me, I’m outro

[Bridge]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
And shout out to my—shouts out
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Renegade, never been afraid, sippin lemonade
Flew to France, sip in different ways, serendipity
Do you ever struggle with your enemies?
Try to conjure energies?
Try to lay a finger on my inner chi, prana
Say what you wanna, I’m onto the next
I’m a new male Madonna, you too worried bout them checks
Can’t keep a shirt on em in the zone of flex
But what about respect?
I’m just too busy to check—Lex Luthor, Kamasutra
Come on, I don’t care, leave that stuff to Obama
Screw yo commas, let my sentence run on
C02 emitting until our damn sun’s gone
Now who’s your number one, huh?
Aye, who’s your number one, huh?
Aye, who ya number one, huh?
Who’s your number two?
Ditto, spit you the truth for real though
Tooth fairy under your pillow, camarillo
I don’t listen to you, I listen to Willow
The ether come out ya speakers, you got a problem?
Speak up, before the teacher leave ya
Red pants dancing with the devil won’t repeat the—
Last century, evolution probably mention me
Penitentiaries, they filling up, that’s why they killing us
Probably see the flaws in the matrix if you real enough
Tried to keep it basic but the doctor’s always pilling us
You even know what penicillin does?
Me either, I am the beat eater
Peeta from Hunger Games here to bring the funk again
Jaden’s alter ego probably jumping in
If it’s fine with you, we rendez-vous at 10
Walk up to ya crib with condoms in my hand
Man we chilling with the kids
They cause some problems in the sand
And all because I told them God was not a man
I love you so I’ll probably carve it in my hand
The cycle’s over, won’t restart it once again
Won’t restart it—beat cold; flow, it’s so retarded
Burning coal just to gain control, homie I got it
Young prophet, come out of pocket
Just to see the geo-engineering stop it, we are boycotting it
Went from picking cotton to be poppin on the rocketship
And now we got the magic
And we frickin Harry Potter on these jokers
And whatever you be droppin, I ain’t coppin it
Cause I’m tryna make sure that my kids will have some oxygen
When they land,you guys won’t understand
"Daddy, could we fly?", I never could but you probably can
And you guys are outta hand
Just look at what’s in your hands
Saving the world is my obligation, it’s not a plan
But I’ll do what I can and I hope I don’t die from a lie
Before I can get y’all to understand
Understand—and ride out to this man



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Doin' what we ain't 'posed to, girl, that's why I chose you
I don't want to impose, just listen close to my poems
Girl don't worry, ain't nobody know
This the type of stuff a joker keepin' on the low
Cause girl you know you're beautiful, a space kitten
Relationships are messed up but your face isn't
Used to taste like Jolly Ranchers
Kisses, now they taste different
Michael Jordan say "Hey Pippen"
Weightliftin', I hate sippin'
Ain't listen, paint glistenin' from the renaissance
Got a problem with the weather, fix it in the tennis box
Black helicopters, even let my menace watch
Keep it clean as Mr. Clean so jokers wear my Dennis socks
Look what I invented, y'all
Hit it with a tennis ball, no consent, I rented y'all
Land in the center, y'all, 3 dimes and a nickel
3 dimes and I write the reciprocal with a pencil
Luckily I'm your principal, luckily there's no principles
Except that you're invincible, only weakened the intervals
So listen close

[Chorus 1: Jaden Smith & Willow Smith]
You might not like me, but I like you
You might not like me, but I like you
We should just let it breathe
Let it breathe, let it—

[Verse 2: Jaden]
I love you, without a reason
Like a baby was teethin', knew you 'fore I was breathin'
People say I'm a heathen, a Hollywood fugitive
Trippin' on some stupid ish, it's really just some ludicrous
Like "Who is this?" Oh he talk a lot of mess and bro
I'm too legit, you see that symbol on my chest
So you should move and sit, because you'll leak it to the press
If I sneeze in front of you, put my steez in front of you
Me and Moises whippin' the Porsche
And we ease in front of you
What you wanna do?
As long as there ain't helicopters I'm down to chill
I don't wanna call my father but swear that I will
Just to conversate and then I'll take care of the bill
Man I never thought I'd fly off to Paris for real
And all of my parents for real
Man I start to see how fictional characters feel
And that issue embarrass me still
Oh don't worry lil' homie, take care of the will
Polly's gone, but he left me his parrot, it's trill
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
And they run, they run
And they come, they come
And they run, they run

[Spoken Word: Jaden Smith]
Sidelines in pride times, no lions
I'm so lyin' if I say I wasn't tryin' to buy into these games
Cupid ain't do no flyin', angels ain't do no cryin', just sighin'
I am 14, I got knots, there will be no tyin'
No Mayan can tell me what time I'ma find my mind
So when I'm in my deathbed dyin'
Imma be in some high end clothes with a MSFTS
Tie in my hand
With that red loud siren
I won't be denyin' my evil deeds
I'll be at Heaven's gate with a crowbar pryin'
While they're screamin, "Don't let this guy in"
Feelin' sorry for myself, Catcher in the Rye-in'
Then I woke up lyin' on the beach
(Where am I?)
One more for the kids before they go to sleep
Love is just so nonexistent in my existence
So that's why I was so persistent in that first quick instant
That we laid eyes
If young love for them is 16 then we must be infants
Cause this is intense, but I'm an eyewitness at love at first sight
But this is just different than anything I've been in
Cause it feels infinite
Most things that you think will last will pass in the blink of a lash
So I think I will submerge my feelings to complete this task
And best believe I'll drown before I let us crash
And seal it from the past
Jeez

[Verse 3: Jaden]
The girl I could never have is elegant and intelligent
And I just kind of fell, but I'm irrelevant in her eyes
And this is somethin' I can settle with
I'm pourin' out my heart, and girl it's kind of for the hell of it
Girl you know that I ain't celibate
I know who your fellow is but we can walk the park
We can talk and we embellish in the creatures after dark
Cause I know that I'm a rebel kid
We come from different elements
But baby girl I can tell I get
On your nerves,  I'm watchin' you observe
It's like the world's an ocean and I watch while you emerge
You the center of attention, girl, no matter what occurs
Cause this youth is like a curse, but it's also like a blessing
Cause I keep these jokers guessing, MSFTS rep is what I'm dressed in
'Til these jokers learn a lesson
If you messin' with my clique, I suggest you get to steppin'
Girl, you're like Juliet with your nurse
And you're lookin' so pretty and I've just been on a search
You're the type of girl that I couldn't just write a verse
So I hit it with the poetry, hopin' that it'll work
If it doesn't then it's fine cause I'll just handle the jerks
Girl I'm playin', no I'm serious, that's just one of my perks
If we're friends then it's cool, just know that we were here first
Through the thick and the thin and now we're here 'til it hurts

[Hook 2: Jaden Smith & Willow Smith]
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
Anywhere you wanna go
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
We can take it really slow
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
We can keep it on the low
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
And I didn't even know
(This was just a crush
This was just a crush
This was just a crush)

[Verse 4: Jaden]
I can feel your body tryna come alive, come alive
I feel you tryna pull me deep inside, deep inside
No I don't wanna lie
Ain't nobody gotta hide, no
I can feel you touchin' me when we're home, we're old
Now I like to look at you, you're like my clone
So don't stare in the mirror
Cause I'll poop all on your party
I don't drive no white Ferrari
No things aren't clearer
I just want to say I'm sorry
But girl you should know yourself
These things ain't gettin' better
No they ain't lookin' up for us
Kissin' you, I'm up to dusk
So paparazzi hush and shush
She was in her 20's, just a crush
But you know I like it when you tell 'em
Bring the whole damn menu
And we eatin' in the venue
Girl you know you like to ball
Chillin' with your friends, nah, ain't see that at all
Man we like the Anunnaki, God ain't them jokers tall
You can't buy that at the mall
True love, you can't try that at the mall

[Interlude: Jaden]
No yeah, um we were really good in Paris, but you know
(No you wasn't!)
Every relationship has ups and downs and the downhills are what makes the uphills
(ups and downs are for a sissy!)
So when I'm feeling all this pain and feel like she doesn't love me or whatever
(she don't love you cause she with me cis'!)
It's just that contrast, but when I feel like she's the only person in the world I want to be with
(yeah right)
Just contrast with those times, you know what I'm saying?

[Verse 5: Jaden]
Man I got some more to say
Have you ever had a crush?
Have you ever felt a rush?
Make your heart stop, she don't even like to blush
Cause she's in her 20's
And I got a crush
Oh man I got a crush
Got a psychedelic dagger in my heart
Lil' homie, tell them paramedics rush cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Man I'm 15 on the scene, lookin' clean
But what does that mean? Cause she's in her 20's
I got somethin' to say
Have you ever had a crush?
Have you ever had a rush?
Make my heart stop, but she didn't even blush
Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
She's somebody you can trust cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's

[Verse 6: Jaden]
I hate crushes, I cover bruises with paintbrushes
Pour it all in the music now that my bank's ruptured
So pretty, she's so perfect, she's so worth it
So bossy, she's so assertive, it's super sexy
She never texts me, she never texts me, she never texts me
Never texts me, she never texts me, forgot to text me
Well I guess we accept the ones that neglect us
And my moms say that we disrespect the ones that perfect us
And try to protect us
But girl I hope that you get this
My thoughts are weighin' me down
My neck can't handle the necklace
Stare at you while you sleep, you had to call a detective
Your father says that I'm reckless, I didn't cause all that wreckage
Your fence was broken, I left it, had to give you this message
I wrote it straight from the soul and it didn't make sense to text it
So I snuck up in your room, put it on your shoulder and in return
You sent me back a restraining order



Part I[Intro: Jaden Smith]
Alright, nigga, no more fun and games, let's go (oh, fuck)
You, you set the standard for (what, me?) the future generation
Liar, yeah, listen

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Slum village with the feeling, get a beat
I bet you I'ma kill it (kill it)
Huh, you ain't ready for the realest high

I thought you knew I'm a villain, (really?) yeah
I don't like it when these jokers
Lookin' at me sideways on a highway
'Cause you know, I'm bout to do it my way
'Til the MSFTS blow, Pompeii
Jay driving it the wrong way
I do not see what your seeing
Lately, I feel European (dream)
Salmon, I'm swimming upstream
Look, I don't know why you a dog
Know I'm coming for the crown (yuh)
Drop an album, kids want to party
Get them niggas out my house (out)
This is Hidden Hills, how are you allowed
I cut the music, it was loud (do it)
You don't deserve my respect
When I talk to Kendrick, man, I sit on the ground (yuh)
Just to get a little reference
So we have no confusion (shit)
My flow Call of Duty prestige
Seeing through your illusions (damn)
The Illuminati's real, that's the deal
Write a book so I can prove it (no)
All you rappers just a nuisance
It's always been more than the music (hey)
Now they looking at my new 'fit
Rockin' Couture on the floor of a Louis V store
And I'm sorry I'm stupid
Riding to Metro, we boomin' (yuh)
All the MSFTS come together in a Tesla
And we zooming

[Interlude: Jaden Smith & A$AP Rocky]
The older you get the worse it gets I guess
Oh my God, that shit's so annoying
You're all here this shit impossible, [?]
Look, look exactly, so, I told her that [?]
You're suppose to [?]
That's what I'm 'bout to say, [?]
He's gotta be able to see it
That's what I'm saying, bro
You see the vision (that's what I'm saying bro)
Yo, can I play?
[?]
At the same time it's kinda difficult to get your money in cash when [?]
Yo, Flacko, let me play you something
Part II[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Yeah, ooh
This one's for all of my renegades
Plan B, sippin' lemonade
Skrt on the beat like a centipede (skrt, skrt, skrt)
Yeah, squad fuck with us heavily
Wack shit, I got a remedy
Blow up like a couple of enemies
Sideline with a felony
On the move like a melody
I don't care what you telling me
I don't do nothing fugazi
'Til I tell you we amazing
I won't be that everything
Bad piece of shh, I'm a royal flush
MSFTS in the building
You should know what's up, what's up, what's up
You call me on the phone
So don't you blow me up
Yeah, hah, whole squad blowin' up, yeah

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
Breaking news there is a band of renegades
Teenagers in north Los Angeles, Calabasas area
Throwing paint, art pieces, blasting their new albums
There has been a triple homicide by a man named Syre
So, you think you can save rap music?



[Intro]
Yup!

[Verse]
Why you drive so fast? Why you drive so fast?
Girl where you gotta go? Girl where you gotta go?
Baby you should try and drive slow
You should try and drive slow
Cause you're going 45 on the 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up to drive all the kids scream
I don't know baby girl you're movin' onto better things
Usually you don't be using me
I'm dead you cry at my eulogy
Magic like Houdini
Baby you taking my scrutiny out with the fireworks
This isn't new to me
Damn baby jump off the roof with me
Live up your youth with me
Before they shootin' me
With all their cameras and bullets
I swear I'm the man up in France with the hooligans
Yeah, I'm up with Centipede, you do not answer me
I'm in the canopy, livin' my life like a fantasy
Sleep with the girl of my dreams on the weeks
So I sleep and I see my reality
Battle me, that's your fatality
Actually, I'm a catastrophe
Go to your school and they ask for me
I'm in your class making cash
And we're fruity like passion
It's burning like ashes
We had to just make this ish happen
He's rappin' again, he's snappin' again
It happened my friends
I'm back with the Benz
And I know you jokers stay pissed
So I had to make you pre-exist



Part I[Intro: Lido & Téo]
I was tryin' to love you, but we
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)
Said shawty I was fucking tryna' love you, but we
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)
I was tryin' to love you, but we
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)
I was tryin' to love you, but we
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)
I was tryin' to love you, but we
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)
Said shawty I was fucking tryna' love you, but we
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)
I was tryin' to love you
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)
Do you love me now?
(Falling down, falling down, falling down)

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Heart is broken, heart is broken
Gettin' green, gettin' green
Man I'm artichokin', man I'm artichokin'
I can't breathe, that's the art of chokin'
That's a, that's an art of chokin'
Send a text and never opened it
You thought I read this shit? Well I was jokin'
Falling down like I'm in Autumn
All you jokers spitting nada, nada, nada
Six minutes and I still gotta mind a mothafuckin' problem
Calm down, calm down

[Interlude: Jaden Smith]
Hm, hm, hm, hm... Now we're still here
Thank you
Part II[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Try me, come try me
I wish you could see what I see
I'm late, you find me so timely
I'm lost, baby, come and find me
Girl, I'm fallin' to the ground and you'll never get me up
I'm just a baby with a stack of needles and a sippy cup
And this shit sucks, need some love, my Aphrodite I can touch
Elvis Presley's coming out of me, my head has got a rush
Didn't pick a fight, the FBI just picked a fight with me
Man, I cry at night, like every night, just come right here and see
Screw your VIP
We are like Adam and Eve, we are like Adam and Eve
We are like Adam and Eve, oh, no, what happened to me, no

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
Jimi Hendrix with the flex
On the Ford motor, rollin', gettin' checks
At your crib for the chill
Who is at the door? All you 'finna check, check, check
Man, you better show respect
Man, I let her go, we both know I had her
Man, I'm madder than a hatter, played my money
Now I'm swagger than Mick Jagger

[Hook]
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, I told 'em
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the check, check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos

[Outro]
You're no good for me girl
You're cruel and infectious
You are my wish, this is me with a death wish
I'm smart, I should get this, but
Your eyes, your hips, your lips
To me they're so precious, I guard them like treasures
I'd run, I'd drive, I'd fly just to met you
Just to witness your gestures
Never, forever, the moments still hold us together
Never, forever, the moments still hold us together
Never, forever, the moments still hold us together
Never, forever, the moments still hold us together
Never, forever, the moments still hold us together
Never, forever, the moments still hold us together
I'll die by sea, girl, I'll die by the sea
Will you die with me, girl, will you die with me
The future I see, girl, will you try to see



[Intro]
I could put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
You're pretty as the ocean
I'm coming with the gang
So you need to get out our way
The ladies love it when I sing
The niggas love my abilities
When I make the fire on the beats
I'm about to make a mil' a week
When I hit 'em with the melodies
I don't care what you tellin' me
Tryna stay away from felonies, oh

[Verse]
Girl, I'm Martin Luther, Martin Luther King
Life is hard, I'm Kamasutra-ing
I'm runnin' through the pain that the youth has been
Inflicted with, it's just ridiculous that you would kill a kid for some Yeezy's
Grab your shoes and give his mom a visit at the funeral, you lookin' fly as hell
Is that really how we're living? Check it
Got a vivid dream of some different (tell 'em)
K. Dot is comin' out of me, the poetry you know it's been a minute
Forefathers put the tax on our real fathers
I don't feel represented, I should be up in the Senate
Swear I feel like Martin Luther, baby, we need Adam, false prosecutor so they won't
Hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand my niggas to the prisons
Forgiveness over your permission
Just because I didn't break it I'ma fix it
And I'm with my dawgs, I'm finna sic ‘em
Teachers said I need a lesson
So I go and start my own school
And it's a mystery to you, you get it?
Misdemeanor's comin' true it ain't the question
But it ain't a problem, they gon' catch you
That's the mind state of the youth including me
We need some new professors
Were you goin' fast son? Yes, sir
It was that autopilot on the Tesla
Heart palpitating so my chest hurts
Probably see it through my sweatshirt, yellow
Mama, mama, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Paint the pedal just so I could go impress 'em
Almost got us on the stretcher
And I'm sorry mama, know you taught me better
You know, you know you taught me better
Father, I don't need a lecture
Man, I know the street is rougher for the texture
And I'm saying
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm the mess-up
I just use these 808's to do confessions
I'm double cursing and I'm flexing
Vile person, Man I feel like I’m in prison
This isn't me, it's my reflection
My purity is the protection from the insecurities of a section of my soul

[Outro]
I just put you on a wave
Just put you on a wave
Follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same
I could put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
Follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same



[Part I][Intro]
Love
The United States and the White House, smile!

[Chorus]
Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

[Verse 1]
When I open my eyes, I wish to see you
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew
Isn't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue
You sit in your room and you listen to tunes
And I'm feeling embarrassed, it's true
You out there in Paris with who?
When I open my eyes (eyes), I wish to see you
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew
I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through, there's a seat just for you
My prettiest secret, I hope that you keep it
I'm blue as a piece of the moon and I know I'll be seeing you soon

[Bridge]
She said "Jaden, you are my soulmate"
You only say that when you're lonely
Girl, I'm suprised you even know me, ay
I'm not gon' fuck, but we can kick it like we homies, ay
'Cause we just homies, baby

[Verse 2]
(Life is a puzzle)
It isn't picture perfect
You could miss perfection in it because it is subtle
The storm is coming and it's raining cats and dogs, stay away from all them puddles
I'm keepin' it humble and noble
I spit that radiation like I’m Chernobyl
My Indus Valley, man, I'm in the valley, crying myself to sleep on the sofa
I told ya I'm more than the kid with a chauffeur
Who don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now
The world's a lot colder now
The MSFTS are stayin' up, I'm tryna hold it down
They stay attackin' us, I'ma just weep on my willow
I look what they sayin', they playin' as I go to sleep on my pillow
But then when I open my eyes, I wish to see you
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew
This ain't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue
I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through, got a seat just for you
Girl, and whether you do, I ain't proud of you so

[Chorus]
Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

[Verse 3]
You need to stand for something or else you'll fall for nothing
Girl, this not my country, we all come from Africa
Now we're up to something
Girl, you're hella grumpy
I think you're just hungry
Cause right now you're actin' up
I don't think you want me
You just want my company
While your man is—
All these girls who laugh at us
Girl, you got me running
From you, I want nothing
Cloudy days aren't sunny

[Segue]
Girl, you make me wanna dance, dance, dance
Put me in a trance, you never wanna hold hands
But I guess I just missed the chance
Miss one text she gets pi—
(Fuck this, not recording anymore...)
[Part II][Bridge]
Sometimes I feel like a stone, sometimes I'm feelin' like
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a stone, sometimes I'm feelin' like
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a stone, sometimes I'm feelin' like
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a slave, sometimes I'm ridin' a wave
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a star
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, star
(I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star, yeah

[Chorus]
Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We've traveled too far from home
Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We've traveled too far from home
Saying that we'll run away
I really doubt that we'll go
I hope the sunset will stay
We've traveled too far from home
Saying that we'll run away
I really doubt that we'll go
I hope the sunset will stay
We've traveled too far from home

[Verse]
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna know
You could be my bride, you could let me come inside
You could be my home
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna fantasize
I don't wanna go
But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets when I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rollin'
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna fantasize
I don't wanna know
But baby you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets when I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rollin'
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
Rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin'
Baby girl, you got me rollin'
Damn out of your control and
I touch your body in the ocean
Then I feel these raw emotions

[Interlude]
Syre
Passion, Pain and Desire just like my big bro'
What you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low, he's invincible
So much soul that he redefined inevitable
So it'll never go
So the sun never set at all instead of setting slow
And as the legend goes Syre lived forever on
And never and forever alone, Syre

[Bridge]
I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We traveled too far from home
Baby, we don’t need a hero
I have never been a hero
I have always been a zero
Baby, you should be the hero
Baby, you should be the hero

[Outro]
Legend says Syre still exists in the mist, in the fog
Poets say he ascended to the Gods
Skeptics say he pretended to be gone
But I say that he's eternally lost



[Intro]
She knows, she knows
She knows, she knows
That when she wears very little make-up
I can see you smile
You have been a wild child for a while, baby
The black and white is tiles, got me for a mile
Landing on my high notes, falling into cycles
The macros and the micros
I can't feel you through them tight clothes
But, I can feel your love it might grow
—angelo is after Michael
Baby, you can be my Sistine
Sixteen...

[Hook]
You're all I need, you're all I need
You are all that I need—oh yes indeed
I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
I am on my knees, oh yes indeed

[Bridge]
The funny thing about life is
I forget it when I write this
Getting famous from my high kick
Tell you what's right there
Nevermind that's frightening
Then I strike like lightning
I write, then I light them
Won't say it again
Sayin' I'm famous we flying to Vegas again
And they say that they pay for this
If your okay with them taping this
Man, I'm debating this

[Verse]
I didn't grow up an atheist
But man it gets so clear who's Satan is
And man I'm not doing your interviews
Cause CNN doesn't have better news
I do all the things that I said I'd do
Open your eyes I'm ahead of you
L-E-X is the avenue, I will not stop until I am incredible
The center of all your attention
Is me when I'm in the room with my center fold
Imma go with me to Ireland
I would just be so surprised if your crew was just eligible
Well I just put my whole clique on a pedestal
Kick it with models but sleep in my bed alone
Young upper echelon
I stay with my clique like a metronome—click
Had a few friends at the crib
And the PoPo came through to come shut down the festival
Had a new chick at the crib she respectable
That's unacceptable, give her flowers ahead of time
She said that she go to Pepperdine cryin' at 9am
"Homie, I said I'm fine"
She said she hate when I'm in her mind
'Long as I make it to dinner time
Then I can ball out, then we can fall out
What is you talkin' 'bout? What is you talkin' 'bout?
I'm talkin' 'bout reading a book up in London
And walking around 'till it's dark out
That vision I saw it now, I'm not a scientist
Go read a hieroglyph, go stay where Osiris is
I'm clearing my sinuses

[Hook]
You're all I need, you're all I need
You are all that I need—oh yes indeed
I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
I am on my knees, oh yes indeed

[Bridge]
The funny thing about life is
I forget it when I write this
Getting famous from my high kick
Tell you what's right there
Nevermind that's frightening
Then I strike like lightning
I write, then I light them
Won't say it again
Sayin' I'm famous we flying to Vegas again
And they say that they pay for this
If your okay with them taping this
Man, I'm debating this



[Hook]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit a candle, I lit a candle in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out of my conscious, out of my conscious in my room?

[Chorus]
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘till forever on
'Till she kills my soul
You're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘till forever on
'Till she kills my soul
You're all that I'll know

[Hook]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit the candle, I lit the candle in my room

[Verse 1]
It's all lost
Cigarettes smoke spark in the dark
Baby girl I worry about you, you never talk
I guess that's the way
I guess that's the way

[Chorus]
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘till forever on
'Till she kills my soul
You're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘till forever on
'Till she kills my soul
You're all that I'll know

[Hook]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle

[Verse 2]
Oh boy you're lost now
Voices in your head gone now
I heard you and so-and-so had a falling out
What was that about?
Something happened and she shot him down
Just be happy that she not around
Boy you not a hero, you a problem child
What type of fire have you started now?
That was all your homies, that was not a crowd
Always walking round, head up in the clouds
Keep me humble baby, sit me down

[Bridge]
So lost
Sit alone in my room waiting for the dark
Cigarettes, smoke, lights and see the sparks
I'll save your soul
I'm trapped in my room

[Chorus]
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘till forever on
'Till she kills my soul
You're all that I'll know

[Verse 3]
I'm all alone
Why can't you just call my phone? (I have a question)
I'm here girl, just come on home
My secrets, you will never know (You will never know)
Why are you so incredible? (Why are you so incredible?)
Why can't I be eligible? (Why can't I be eligible?)
Did I skip you because I'm telling untold
And I'll go

[Hook 2]
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy
I don't look outside, I don't at all
I'm in the chateau
I know there's a love for us
I know there's a love for us
I know your on to shit
I know you're by yourself
I know there's a love for us
For all our accomplishments
This is beyond our sin
I did not want this shit
I was a lost boy, I do not got a choice
I couldn't live alone
All I got is my voice
We didn't conversate
You didn't wanna talk
I don't wanna fight with you
Just wanna spend the night with you

[Verse 4]
Syre died in the sunset, don't be like him
Man that's where the story ends, but it also begins
He's building pyramids, he's getting serious
Until he drove himself delirious, like are you hearing this
This ain't an outer body conversation about conspiracists
Even though I may appear as this
See, Syre grew a tear in his eye
Because the summer’s too bright for his spirit in the night
There’s a python in the pyramids
Look, this is for the kids feeling lost
Sleep on the street, eating the moss
I don’t got no more teeth in my jaws ‘cause I ripped them out
I’m sick of killing innocents at large
This is for the kids feeling lost
MSFTS got you at all costs, yelling fuck 'em all
We hold each other, we never fall
It’s us versus the all
From the cats to the dogs, forever
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I let that one rock, I let that one rock
Check it out, this the bonus track, this the bonus
My favorite albums used to have the bonus track like this, you know what I’m saying?
This that Madison Square Garden

[Hook 1]
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this

[Verse 1]
Can't find me up up and away
I give a fuck bout your wave
My nigga I surf everyday
Drownin' my soul in the basement, aye
I ain't got much in the bank
I got a lot I could say
Got a blue goddess to say
I hope you forgive my mistakes
Yeah, ride around with a renegade
You should take a seat, save your energy
I try to heal the gods with a band-aid
And the time I need you call your enemies
I landed in Ibiza and I need a visa
I ain't playin' with you this no Mamma Mia
Need a Hottie Tottie with a body, yeah
I just spit the knowledge then I'm out of here

[Post Hook]
(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town and we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hunnit thou?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down

[Verse 2]
I stamp that we cool
I'm awesome, kickflip in the Carsons
We should run for the pool
I got the fire flow, the department exhausted
I owe nothing to you
I'm in the Tahoe, man you making me nauseous
Pullin up with the crew
You such a hypebeast, man
You making me vomit, look—

[Hook 2]
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Its always been more than the music
You riding waves in the back of my cruise ship
Look, Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it my nigga you foolish

[Post-Hook]
(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town and we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hunnit thou?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down

[Verse 3]
Look, look, look
This shit is out of here
You got the heat I was not aware
Me and Bebe out in Rotterdam
Got a new man, damn now I see him
He on the floor, in my coliseum
I hope to god he don't sign a prenup
See my ex on the street like I never seen her!

[Hook 3]
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
You see me dancing like I'm Elvis
Just tell your man that it's all in the pelvis
Look, watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it my nigga you foolish

[Post Hook]
(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town and we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hunnit thou?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down



[Intro: Harry Hudson]
So I dream in color
I found Eve sleeping with another
Take my hand, but don't pull me under

[Hook: Harry Hudson]
Cause if I fall for you, it's gon' be trouble
And if I fall for you, there's gon' be trouble

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Girl I'm wondering, I'm just wondering
Is it just me or would you do the same thing to another kid
Girl, I understand if a heart is never broken
Where the hell the fun in it
Got my shooters really wanna run in it
You're a nice girl, we just taking pics
You know I run with the intelligence
Man I swear the city hate the melanin
Just how I hate the weapons that they sellin' 'em
And I don't care what they tellin' now
I be sonning jokers, I got hella kids
Fucking with the clique and you're a skeleton
Put a kiss around my heart, Pelican
Got a couple secrets I don't tell my friends
Started walking slow and then I fell again
Like why, all these knives started falling from the sky
Man, I’m doubting I’ll survive
Why you trying to turn me into your guy
Baby, I'm just tryna catch your vibe

[Chorus: Harry Hudson]
Cause if I fall for you, it's gon' be trouble
And if I fall for you, There's gon' be trouble

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Girl I'm wondering, I'm just wondering
Is it just me or would you do the same thing to another kid
Girl, I understand if a heart is never broken
Where the hell the fun in it
Got my shooters really wanna run in it
You're a nice girl we just taking pics
So you know I hated our relationship
And girl you know I run with the intelligence
Swear the city hate the watermelon and the melanin
Girl, your heart is open so I fell in it
I'ma follow the rules, then rebel again
As soon as I can get a whiff of freedom
All these girls you know I never need 'em
Know you think I'm so conceited
My innocence will never be defeated
Lately, I'm running from demons
Been having trouble since I was a fetus (Jaden)
My heart is tatted with description, my chest is hurting
Girl, I'm just a bishop, had a problem listening the father figures
Now I'm on a wave, hope that God is with us
But I've calmed—calmed down
Not as vicious, I'm just glad I got a kitchen pot to piss in
If I didn't that would mean I blew my riches
Screw these other girls, girl I know I'm trippin'
Girl, you know I'm trippin' on you
I think you picked the wrong dude
All eyes on me, sippin', fall through it all
Oh, you don't know what I'm going through
The saddest shit is so true, that's why my soul is so blue

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

[Outro: Jaden Smith & Harry Hudson ]
(We falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
(We falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
(He falling down, he's so beautiful, he'll fall)
(He doesn't know where he is, he's so confused)
You won't wake up, why not?
He can't remember
(He forgot, he doesn't remember, he died before)
(He doesn't remember) yeah I know
(Can you hear me? Yeah, I can)
(Came back to us)
(Where is he? Right here)
(Syre, she loved you)
Your wake up call is coming



Song 1

[Verse 1:]
Look, Imma tell you bout my life
Imma tell you about my life
What's wrong in it, what's right
That long linen I tried to fight but then I died
I resurrect through the night
Came alright in a flight, you jokers are flying with me
You landed right on my kite
You jokers are sippin' sprite, man throw that off
People say I'm hard as Hennessy and you soda soft
Man I'm talking to my enemies and I'm sorta saw
But I treat my music like it's a craft, you imported yours
Man I treat my MSFTS like the Lakers - the court is ours
Look a nine year old in the face and say you're in charge
It's our time to shine little homie - the floor is ours
We're the neanderthals lets get rid of these dinosaurs
Man the time is ours, we just got a couple hours
Get rid of these towers and lets grow us a couple flowers, they won't allow us
But our powers are bigger than what we fathom
If they told us back then then they know that we would've had em
What we don't know is that it was Even then it was Adam
And they gon hate me for that but I'm flying high as Aladdin
And I told you, moving crazy I don't have a pattern
Imma go buy me a house on a moon that's orbiting Saturn
I live it, yeah I live it, beat you man I already did it
I already did it
Check it

[Verse 2:]
Tell these jokers first off, you the worst off cause you got on my bad side
Man that's how I felt the first time I saw my dad crying
Got on my phone, I had to go call my rabbi man I mean my pastor
Oh wait I mean my best friend
Homie you're nothing less than me when I'm manifesting
These crazy verses, I didn't write them I guessed them
Other rappers I bless them, I do not beat them I rest them
Take a look at my family damn we look like the X-men
Oh no no no don't address them
Can't you see how they dress them
They probably surrounded by models and a bunch of them yes men
I'm surrounded by no-men oh no man it's a omen
Holden I thought you told em I rode this beat like it's stolen
It is, but bro it's golden I had to give em the coldest
The flows that I can indulge in before they life is unfolding
In front of them, all this time don't kick it none of them
Imma stay on the moon you just say when the sun'll come and I'm done
I ain't saying I'm number one
But I'm a winner a subtle one
H-H-how ya like me now?

[Verse 3:]
Look at me I'm fresh to death I left your neck decapitated
And your girl fascinated, ugh and I'm glad you hate it
Aggravated, aggravated, aggravated
Man I'm mad I made it, now they comparing me to these lames
Man these drama sell art don't compare me these stains
Man I'm just a consciousness don't compare me with brains
I'm a G and that G only gon stand for genius
People are scared when they round you, simple, they never seen this
And I'm out
Don't be scared to call me the cleanest cause I'm back
And I'm taking the spot for freshest and meanest sup with that?
Man you  jokers didn't believe us till I rapped
And I started to speak like Jesus' fetus, holy crap
Lemme introduce you to rap
You jokers are bleeding on my Adidas
Running faster than cheetahs, I'm sorry you couldn't beat us
New school have patience, don't worry we'll be your leaders
That's that, lemme introduce you to rap
R-A-P, rhythm and poetry hit these jokers with the symbol so they gon know it's me
It's only G

Song 2

[Verse 1:]
Slum slum, don't give the public any food little crumb crumb
Deep under the ground military say I'm dumb dumb
But you probably dumber, machines guns in backs of the hummers
Bullet proof well that should cover the summer (nevermind)
It's the truth so bro I'm skipping the stutters
I'm sick with my brothers
That flouride get you like them fresh clothes fit you
Words never see the lights until them rappers spit you and I'm out
Just like your night light is
Surfing tidal waves up in my dreams like I was Tidus
Talking bout the clothes or the flows they the tightest
Spirit of a master, head of a ibis
Mathematics is precise it's like I went to school in Greece
MSFTS Republic, mystery is on the fleece
We just the reckless kids who like to skate up in the streets
Till our parents call and say that they've been talking to police
Now we out, like I'm the priest
The precinct is watching me sink like I'm a thief
Jumping off a tree and use a leaf as a parachute
I freakin' drown these jokers if they ever get embarrassed
You stab 'em with the sabertooth I'm breathing like I'm Vader's suit
Jaden goes say hey to Zeus it don't fit me like Ace's shoes
But I'm acing Dr. Seuss lyrics when the masons lose
My mom says that I should take my shoes
But I need excuses for the week, so I escape my school
You freakin' kids mistaking fake for cool
At night I'm watching but end of day I take my stake to school
You think I'm weird but fake you skating too
The rumors says I'm chilling with your girl don't make me make it true
Take your fate and make it blue
Take a drake and fly it to the place where they ain't chasing you
Paparazzi on me rocking Roxy homie got a box of socks
And don't be mad because I'm boxing OGs
Charge me like a mophie, you jokers lowkey
And bring the bass in, measure everything like I'm a mason
The paper chasing is over, this kids amazing
I'm sorry this kid's a mason
We tattle tell with Mason
We got a church but we treat it like it's a basin water to put your face in
Shoes to do the lacing, corruption when you walk
Corrupt you when you talk, what you up to in the dark?
It's like, R2-D2 see thru Machu Picchu
You can't know this, I should eat you
I'm your shifu cut the crap I don't like seafood
We could hit the Staples Center bro I don't like people
No I don't like people, I'm too selfish and nervous
But people say Jay you're the coolest you can't tell on the surface
But they listen to the music you can't tell that it's worthless
You can't tell that I'm nervous well here's a lift of the curtains
It go uh-uh-oh, uh-uh-uh-uh-oh

Song 3

[Verse 1:]
You should try to fit your feet in these 9 and a half shoes
At 7 learned a lesson, it's only that cash rules
Maybe it'd be different if we ain't have bad schools
We'd have less people with snapbacks and tattoos
The furthest from bad dudes, they've just been corrupted
People say I sound like Q-Tip, keep you on the up tip
Saying "Jaden, why you tripping, why you change the subject?"
But my randomness is what you jokers fall in love with
But check it
The school system is seriously just a system
And anyone under 18 just falls in line as a victim
Like take 'em, look at our youthful and see the pain that's inflicted
It's like they rented the building, I'm trying to get them evicted
They're trying to get us addicted, it's wicked like we gon' stick with this
The internet exists you idiot, man, we figured this
Human consciousness shifting plates of the continents
I never thought that I'd have an army as strong as this and rah

[Verse 2:]
Futuristic 'ish, revolutionary
Man, the truth is buried, don't get it, the truth is scary
Screw these corporations, I'm making the core proration
With no fluoride in the water to support the nation
Man, I'm sick of this
So I divorce the nation
Then drop the wickedest album hear it across the nation
Man, I promise I'd never cross the nation
But the boy's a man, I guess I lost my patience

[Break:] (2x)
This is my Michelangelo
This is that fly-fly
This is for Hov and Jay Brown
But I'm out for now, homie, ta-ta

[Verse 3:]
Hopefully all you jokers can be as dope as me
Once you grow up and go and live your life how it's supposed to be
I'm not gon' drop it, I'm in a rocket, I'm in the cockpit
Holden brought his own Glock and cocked it, it's in his pocket
Man, he shot it while losing pressure, screw these investors
I can do it better, screw you and your Louie sweater
In 20 years, I'll be a veteran, you better let him in
Because I'm ballin' like a letterman-
Jacket, let it settle in (Jaden, you are sick!)
Screw your medicine
Poison me and Imma end up dead again
I'm talking to the kids that are enlightened, the Indigo
I'm talking about the kid sighing staring out of the window instead of Nintendo
You are not alone
Man, I'm here for you
If I found out that you passed I would probably shed a tear for you
MSFTS, we cheer for you, your true extended crew
I'd pay for all our sins and I'd even take a spear for you
I'm done



Part I[Intro]
Baby girl I just hope
When I grow up I can know the ropes
I'm never selling my soul
Guess we won't know until we know
So all I can do is hope, hope, hope
All I can do is hope
When I die leave a note
Until then I just hope, hope

[Verse 1]
I'm about to switch it on you all
My shoes are bleeding with the blood of Martin Luther King
These ain't no Louboutin
This is for Tuff Gong
This is for activists riding in Teflon
With a bulletproof vest on
This is for MSFTS who know that i'm serious
This is for all the delirious kids
Who can live inside a prison pyramid
There's kids in prison, are you hearing this?
But lately this is not a conspiracy
I don't label myself a conspiracist
I need a therapist look, Fahrenheit 451
Building seven wasn't hit and there's more shit to come
The pentagon is on a run
I just hope I go to heaven when this shit is done
Business is business I get it
I'm just wishing all these prisons
Was not independent
Lobbyists are in the senate
Lobbying to make it obvious
Innocent people are prosecuted for a living
I talked to Judas in my vision your bullshit is done
I'll be Martin Luther in a minute
Once all the products in the kitchen
Why do you even get passionate when you be spitting?
You know they don't even listen
They care about YSL
And putting lean up in their fridges
And wearing crosses like they're Christian
When playing chess and I'm the bishop
I've just ran out of ammunition baby
But I'm still on a mission
Your verses sound like dirty dishes
And that's just a joke

[Interlude]
Well baby all I do is hope
Baby all I do is hope
I'm never selling my soul
Yeah we'll never know until we know
Baby all I do is hope, hope, hope
Baby all I do is hope
When I crawl my body knows the ropes
And I'm never selling my soul (no, no, no)
And I'm never selling my soul (no, no, no, no, no, no)
Selling my soul (no, no, no)
Part II[Verse 1]
Gloomy gloomy days in Calabasas
Cities on the maps and now it's hella ratchets
MSFTS soldier with my stripes and badges
Shouldn't plug the clique but that's just automatic
Got her number there, well what's her name?
Never hit her up but I'm so glad to have it
In case a lonely day she'll fall upon me
I can make a call and we can share some magic
Got a psychopathic flow I'm scared of snapping
Hit them into the back and they don't know what happened
So subliminal that they didn't know
Smooth Criminal, call me Michael Jackson
I would die for this, a suicidal passion
You and I were simply too aloud to have had it
Girl, my ego had to die, ego had to fly
I'm just really glad this room is padded
Because I'm going harder than a running back
Once I get it all, I ain't coming back
Girl I guess we'll never talk again
Well I didn't know that you wanted that
Could've left you with them other kids
Would've helped us with a lot of suffering
Now I'm hanging out with mutual friends
And they just do a lot of wandering
You want the comma, comma, comma, comma
I ain't want the drama, drama, drama, drama
Take you anywhere in the world you wanna go
Baby you're my pseudo babymama
Me and you a gang, gang, gang, gang
No bandana, that's no problem
Feeling cooler than a fanna'
Run through where you wanna baby

[Bridge]
First look through the valley
I can feel your body
Laying right beside me
First look through the valley
Girl I swear you got me
I can feel your body
I can feel your real side of you
I feel your sound
Kiss me through the girls
Go where we go on and on
On, and on, and on

[Outro]
Hey... Syre... Who is she?
So... do you party much?



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
You got the cash, well I am about to come in and embezzle it
I am on a whole 'nother level
I put the bass up in your face
You're feeling it treble
You jokers corny like kettle
My superflow is so olympic that I need a medal
Pop out the bushes like "Hello!"
I reach for the top and never settle
You say you rock, you a pebble
I rock and roll, I'm heavy metal
Where are you now?
Where are you now? I'm whipping it
Sitting back, listening
Where are you, where are you now?
Dipping it, butterfly, butterfly
Where are you now?
Falcon, falcon, fuck 'em

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
There's cops on the road, fuck 'em
There's cops on the road
There's cops on the road, fuck 'em
There's cops on the road, falcon
I'm on the move
Cops on the road, douse 'em
I got you all bouncing, falcon

[Bridge: Raury]
I am not afraid to walk the lonely road
I'm so curious of where it goes, oh
Who really cares, we won't be there
When kingdom comes, it all falls down
(Cops on the road)

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
I hope wherever you are
You can see all of the stars, constellations
I'm impatient, you are beautiful (beautiful)
You should know (you should know)
Wherever you go, I'ma follow
Wherever you go, I'ma follow
My heart is so hollow, I'm high as Apollo
Seventeen, having problems with all of them models
We got them red bottoms and bottles
We gotta go skrrt, hand on the throttle
Oh, only you can hold me down
What do you think I'm doing when you're not around?
I'm just at home by myself
Or out with them girls, oh, we both know that doesn't help me
No, no I'm ready to go
So much better than before
Nigga said I wasn't dope
But now my head is on the road

[Break]
Bounce (got me swerving on the road)
Bounce (all them cops is on the road)
Bounce, bounce (cops, falcon)

[Verse 3: Raury & Jaden Smith]
Backin' out my license to Atlanta
I’m an African-American
A variant to what my stages like in the world
It’s gon' to hell, I just roll up the gas and pass it
All around the circle to my day one homies
Oh, you actin' like you know me
Remember when I was so lowkey
Chill in the cut with a doobie and a cutie
Man I gotta live life
I know they gon' judge me
But that's a necessary evil
And I was going to sin like people
I'm living a lie, trying to do this right
Go mama do your dance
Leave my money in advance, the Louie V pants
I'm never playing bout my bands
Kick in your door, “Doo! Doo! Doo!"
With the tool in my hand
Raury they don't understand
We had to stick it to the man
We bout to hit the road
Leave the money where I can
Let them hate on this event
That's just a piece of the plan

[Skit: News reporter]
Breaking news. There seems to be a high speed police chase, at north bound on the Los Angeles 101 freeway. There seems to be two cars trying to outrun police officers with falcon winged doors. This is interesting, stay tuned...

[Outro]
Do you remember now?
Syre, the boy who chased the sunset, until it chased him
The boy who had no fears, until he faced them
The boy whose words seem to never make sense
This is ninety

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
Cause you got me face down

[Bridge 1]
And don't take it personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

[Hook]
I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you
Tell me whatcha say now

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Listen close to what I say to you
Back in the day I hated you
Don't worry we made it through
That was back in the days
No one cared about Jaden dude
He hangs with his MSFTS and the kids that think Satan’s cool
But lately you been bringing out in me a young poet
Your monogamy, it bothers me you know it
There's no need to show it
On my poetry you saw me throw it
Your man just came through in a Range
Hope they tow it girl just for the moment
Cause your body's a temple, it's simple no need for an intro
See what's sinful and they want it, they keep it resentful
Girl don't listen to these pimps, they got no one to vent to
Said you want some In-N-Out we should probably hit Ventu
And I went through probably all of the texts that i sent you
And I meant to tell you that I stencil my love with a pencil
I can't express it through all my stressing and adolescents
Same with Willow
I need a doctor to come assess us
I'm sick of guessin'
I'm sick of dresses, I'm sick of dressin'
Let's get undressed and let's make a mess
'Til we feel the presence, like girl I can feel the presence
Girl it's like you're my therapist and I love our sessions
And baby girl it's unbearable when we in the kitchen
Cause we gotta be quiet cause your parents listen
Like screw this I'm sick of kissing
Like baby I'm on a mission
Everytime we away we casually reminiscing
Our practice is repetition..

[Hook]
I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like em
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
And do different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

[Bridge 2]
In the way (like a bitch)
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

[Outro]
I don't need you (x4)
I still want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I, but I love you
I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you



Part I[Verse 1]
Done with reminiscing
Spittin' fire hotter than the pot up in the kitchen, yuh
And lately I've been itchin' to take a rapper on
'Cause I'm really done with all the sneak disses, yuh
My whip is fully electric, you need a lesson just to whip it, ay-ay
I'm on the other side havin' way too good a time
Baby, why you still trippin'? Yuh
Probably 'cause I'm sippin' penicillin
'Cause I'm so sick, Joker, I'm just chillin' like a villain, yuh
Couldn't think of any better feelin', no
I hope you trip when I whip out the flow, what?
She got the ice, I can tell, watch when I slip on the snow, oh
Gas, goin' fast to my destination, I ain't worried 'bout traffic (no)

[Break]
Look, are we in Colorado (wait) or at Mardi Gras?
Girl, you party hard, I'm a genie in a bottle, ay
Wishin' for all y'all, get the motorcycle, hit the throttle
Watch me hit them guitar notes
I just need me a model, reincarnation's the motto

[Hook]
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion

[Verse 2]
Ay, skinny, young, jiggy in the city, yuh (yo)
Huh, I say I wanna battle and you say you too dizzy, no
You just don't want to mess with the finessin'
I get it, they say you stressin', keep you living
I hope you know that I been spitting since I turned seven
If you're a ship, I'm 'bout to wreck it, I told you
Look, skinny, young, jiggy in the city, yuh
I don't talk to you, I'ma talk to my bruhs, uh
Go to Philly, say hello to my cousin, oh
You talking all that mess, I know you don't want it, yuh
Hey, skinny, young, jiggy in the city, yuh
Hey, ay, be my baby girl, you hella pretty, yuh, yuh, yuh
Motocross cross down the street to this beat
I'm popping a wheelie (skrt)
Keep my family closer than these jokers
Don't make me go to Philly
I told you—I’m better than all you
I'm not gonna hold you, shoutout to Whole Foods
Them jokers are old news
You know it's lit when they don't notice you
I'm 'bout to market Tesla
And I shed a bullet for my MSFTS soldiers who I owe it to
The FDA is all on me, you know its true
The clique is rolling and I'm on the move

[Hook]
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion

[Break]
Look, are we in Colorado (wait) or at Mardi Gras?
Girl, you party hard, I'm a genie in a bottle, ay
Wishin' for all y'all, get the motorcycle, hit the throttle
Watch me hit them guitar notes
I just need me a model, reincarnation's the motto
Part II[Verse]
Yeah, look—
(Syre, don't do this)
I don't wanna cry
I just want to get you out of my mind
(Don't open up to him)
Open your eyes
I been by your side through all of this time
(Don't tell him anything)
Excuse the disguise
For all the magic that is hitting my mind
We're living a lie
Open your eyes
I been by your side through all of this time
Through all of them guys
Through all of them lies
(I love you more)
Ooh, help us
Something is new, tell us
Talking to you, selfish
I do not want to die
Ooh, help us
Something is new, tell us
Talking to you, selfish
I do not want to die



[Intro]
(Yeah)
Oh, shit (woo)
I'm like, (ay) uh (shit)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like a Polaroid picture
Trapped inside space and time, take a sip of my elixir, ay
Play "Electric Love" while we riding in the Fisker, ay
She fell in love with me, my G, I swear I never kissed her, ay
Need me to be free, I don't have time to be a mister, ay
Baby, I'll be blunt with you, I won't be smoking swishers
I just do a couple dishes, then I wish you Merry Christmas
Adios, make that body roll, you scream "geronimo"
Blow some kisses to some mistresses, they fall like dominos
Dominos, vamonos, baby girl, I gotta go
I just talked to Billboard Records, they said I'm phenomenal
(I'm phenomenal, I'm phenomenal)

[Hook]
Yeah, my name is George Jefferson
The male Maleficent
You don't know who you're messing with
I ran for president
'Cause our country is in a deficit
My only testament is that we keep it so, so real
I'd kill myself to resurrect, hoo
(I'd kill myself to resurrect)

[Verse 2]
You know she know I'm the man
I got her number on the Gram
I would never understand
Kickin' it with Rich the Kid
I just woke up with the bands
30 something, we in France
I just woke up, I'm in Cannes
Never let him have a chance
Huh, cheetah prints on the pants
Expelliarmus, me and Harry Potter in the Benz
Nobody look at my dab, run around skrtin', we mad
Louis just gave me a bag, how did he end up with that?
And nobody look at my dab
Now I'm runnin' with the RAF
Living in and out of cabs, uh
"Baby boy what's your name?"
I thought you'd never ask

[Hook]
Yeah, my name is George Jefferson
The male Maleficent
You don't know who you're messing with
I ran for president
'Cause our country is in a deficit
My only testament is that we keep it so, so real
I'd kill myself to resurrect, hoo

[Bridge: Jaden Smith & Willow Smith]
Kill myself to resurrect, ay
Kill myself to resurrect, ay
(Jaden, Mom is on the phone for you)
I was... I was just on the phone with her
(Jaden, Dad is on the phone for you)
Let's go...

[Outro]
Huh, super-psychedelic sleeping isn't new to me
I tried to sleep it off to deal with everybody's scrutinise
Baby, call me Willy Wonka
On my Oompa Loompa-cies
Man, I only whipped a Tesla
But I'll cop the coupe and screech (skrt)



[Spoken Word: Stanza 1]
Syre, a beautiful confusion
(I love you...)
The story of a boy who chased the sunset until it chased him
(Where you goin'?)
Never quite sure about his placement
Or where he's been in this pink world
Or why nothing ever made sense
He knew that he had loved and had been loved
But had no chronological order to place it
(So confusing...)
All he knew was that he woke up everyday
Bleeding with amnesia and the case of new memories
That he had tendencies to mistake for fiction
(She saw...)
So everyday he journeyed to the mountain to recover his past
In order to understand his future
(I can't remember all this...)
She loves him but she eventually killed him
(Pow, pow, pow, pow...)
Now listen, Syre was a mischief with a vision
But his most poetic trait was his wisdom
(Where you goin'?)
His mind was as bright and as pink as the city that he lived in
And the only kids that could live in this bliss
Were the outcasts, the MSFTS
(Why did you leave?)
Those were his companions
Even though they could never understand his struggles
Through these harsh lands
He gave them the upper hand of his emotional tantrums

[Spoken Word: Stanza 2]
Syre—passion, pain and desire
Just like my big bro
What you didn't know is this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low he's invincible
(Time...)
So much so, that he redefines inevitable, so it'll never go
(Brace yourself...)
It seems as though the sun wouldn't set at all
Instead of setting slow
She lies to him and said she'd never let him go
(You're a liar...)
And as the legend goes
Syre lived forever on and never and forever alone
(Syre...)
Syre (We should never end this, I love you...)
(A beautiful confusion, I'm Syre)



{Intro Talking}
So like
Like you just sent me a text like
Tryna be like cool
Like we're dope now
Like we're dope
Like we're just gonna be friends
That's the text you just sent me
Just now

{Verse 1 - Jaden}
I'm kind of lost now
Been intervening, no meaning
I have no cause now
My heart is bleeding
A tiny bit, I need gauze now
Im only pleading that you and me can be awesome
But that's unrealistic
Pain that you inflicted
It's so wicked
Im addicted
Girl the plates have shifted
I ain't tryna get physical
I just, wanna know do you still wear lipstick
Your so encrypted
Your loves my drug, and you got me lifted
Just one night come chill with the MSFTS
Ah, we can just be friends
And we'll hold hands
And dance until the night ends
And I'll run the engine
Don't worry bout vengeance
I'll let you finish all of my sentence-s
You right here, right now
Girl that's a blessing
Just one night we should learn some lessons
Looking so fly, love the that way you dressing
Uh, like this we can get some mo'
Get it poppin like a festival
But the rest should go
I'll spit it you just give me the pace
Can't breathe like I'm living in space
Imma kick it with AcE
Sorry ma, I ain't been in the states
Cause my life is a chase
And I'm winning the race
See that you wanted a taste
Starts here with my hand on your waist
I don't care what they say
I wasn't even looking at you
But they said you here with that dude
Is that true?
Hop up in the cab too
We be running till I catch you
Don't doubt that
Wanna raid, we can scout that
MSFTS we about that
That's the clique right there
Lil homie you should shout that
Going down, reroute that
We going up right now

{Chorus - Willow}
I, think I, can find you somewhere
(4x)
Dance!

{Beat Drops}

{Verse 2 - Jaden}
Uh, Loo-Loo-Lookin for somethin' precious
All Im seein is toothpicks in dresses
Well I guess it's
Time to leave
Until I get so intrigued
With somethin I can believe
It's like, Jesus
Walked through and putted you in pieces
What I means is
It's time to go get us some beezus
Cause we gon' go to Ibiza and Indonesia
Wherever I can please ya'
Girl Im not gonna tease ya'
We can go up in the trees
Or the palace like Caesar
Just tell me where the keys are
Say cheese
Ah, I hate takin' pictures
Im not broke, so you can't fix us
Im the vicious
Yes, you'll miss us
Girls that kiss us
Rep the Sixers
Uh, MSFTS we soarin
Here in 4 in the morning
Spilt Orange Juice on Ralph Lauren
All them parties are boring
Orange Juice is still pouring
We be wild when we touring
We careless about insurance
And what you did isn't important
We missin up your decor and
We'll end up right on the floor and
We're coolin out with guitarin
We messin up all you chores
Fix it all in the morning
MSFTS is in this roaring
And Willow's kickin the door in
And AcE is killin them chords
Cause

{Chorus - Willow}
I, think I, can find you somewhere
(4x)
Dance! (Echos)

{Beat Drops}



[Intro]
Eighteen, yeah
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, yeah
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, yeah
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, yeah
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, yeah
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, yeah
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, yeah
Eighteen, eighteen

[Verse]
Uh, man I need to finish, I should finish
Man, I need to finish my album
Go on tour, find Sarah
Then I sip vodka kinda like a fountain
Young Calabasas kingpin
Life is just a journey up a mountain
Get a up and down, scouting
Bouncer saying, "Why you bouncing?"
Just wear my hair up
Blow my cover when I walk in and DJ announce it
You always with the model chicks
They ain't thick, they just weigh a few ounces
I'm a black panther, watch me pounce quick
Get the fire hose, finna Dhalsim
I don't mess with the rap game
Me and Raury chillin in the Falcon
Ain't gone fill me up, with your doubt pen talk
With your girl saying, "How can this lil' joker fit a thousand words in a sentence like a Malcolm X Y, Z"—don't try me
MSFTS around the globe regard me highly
And I'm running from the cops, Cyrus
Man these jokers probably think I'm Miley
Confused teen and I might be
In-between an innovator and a Hypebeast
And I know you don't like me
And its just cause you just like me
I just chose not to wear the wife beater
With the Nikes and the white tees
And now everybody wearing tight jeans
Once upon a time you thought you'd fight me
Well I guess now, we should square up
Like my sap niggas up in Paris
Take a pair of parables and tear em up
'Fore your damn poetry embarrass us
I'm under ground like I'm Harriet Tubman
Clique is training, we preparing to run shit
Feeling lit, I'll take my parents to London
Trust you don't want this
The clique is ready for the functions
You ain't ready for this subject
I treat my body like it's Jean Michel
Pay a pretty penny if you touch it
Call me Keanu, I'm Neo
I should hit that with the free throw, swish
Fake ice on my wrist man, I'm frio
I should hit them with the Rio
Your banana flows they don't appeal
I told you I'm the man of steel
I believe in Santa still
Cause I got more ice than the snow
I cannot buy no more clothes
I got to the store, it was closed
Imma play this at the shows
I woke up my wrist it was froze
Since when is Jaden golden?
I was learning, you ain't notice?
Now I came back and I'm on my grown shit
Look here baby, you should focus
The ignorance is numbing you
And now I'm spitting this and novacaine is over
Running round the city like a casanova
Peter Piper picked a golden pencil from a shoulder
Turned a lyricist into a soldier
How many times have I told ya?
And how many times am I telling them
Just because you see the melanin
Doesn't mean that I'm a felon
I'm here to show you the intelligence
What is the bullshit you're selling them?
They just want us all in jail and then
They can take away our right to vote and use the free labor
Aye, I know you're not a slave bruh
And I didn't even need to say much
Man you knew since you was born there
You were sent down here to save us
But life just keeps throwing shit at you
And you was looking for a break huh?
Well, here it is...

[Musical Outro]



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Life is slow motion
And im' swimming in the ocean
When I'm next to you
If im not with you then I'm texting you
Cause
I miss you
It's like sparks when I kiss you
Girl
Whats the issue?
We're fighting again
In the studio
I'm writing again
Make it rain, cause it's lightning again
Video doing lightning again,(geeze)
Breaking up, I was frightened again
Get in trouble, I was lying again
I don't really know where the ground is
And I
Don't really know what a noun is
Cause I don't go to school and I'm hanging with some foolish kids
That be chillin' at the movies
I never really truly met you
I'm Romeo, you'll be my Juilet boo
Do
Look so good in the dress you wore, you looks so cute in those glasses
You said I look good in that vest that I wore, tell me when you get out of your classes
Cause
Seeing you around, and all my friends tell me that you go to Calabasas High
And I stare up in your eyes and I don't know why, I stare longer than your lashes
I
Think, I could write a couple songs cause this stuff is straight out of a movie
I could get lost in the music,but baby please don't lose me

[Hook: Purity Ring]
Bring, bring the thunder
And the loud, loud rain
(please,please don't lose me)
Lead our walls asunder
'neath the proud, proud veins
(please,please don't lose me)
Of traits that bleed the gunmen
Of our pumping, earthly hearts
(please,please don't lose me)
Ween our joys in plunder
Feel our shining teeth
Bet our hold on happiness
(please,please don't lose me)

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Girl hold me when you can
Cause this love is not as strong as it was
Cause
You're making a fuss over nothing
And you know it stays right in my trust
I remember you would blush
Now you stay using your blush
Just because we keeping us on a hush
Girl there's no reason to rush
Just forget it, you did it, your love is so acidic, your'e gon' have to put in your clinic
I admit it
And it burns when we keep taking these turns
Had a few concerns for a minute you be tripping
Don't understand why you keep changing your plans
White socks, but you not rocking no Stance
Put on my hand, and you still don't wanna dance
And you not playing my jams
Wow
I put my foot up on the break, girl we made mistakes, we should probably take a break
All the songs I make are just only for your fate
And you stay playing your Drake, I don't think i'll take this
No more, you bore me...wake up in the morning
And I need a new story
Sorry
9 o clock date and I showed up tardy
And I'm hardly
The same kid from last October
MSFT solider
Gotta little older,gotta little colder
For
The better, whatever
People say I'm clever
So I hope a few endeavors
Hope we're not together just so we can feel this pleasure
And our hearts you couldn't sever
And I hope you know I love you
Forever

[Hook: Purity Ring]

[Outro]
Please,please don't lose me
Please,please don't lose me...



[Verse 1]
It's the coolest of the coolest
It's the smoothest of the smoothest
It's the crudest and the rudest of the stupid kids
Mr. Vicious with his misses
Blowing kissies to his mistress
And his misses blowing riches like some hooligans
I wasn't tripping, I just listen
To these women when they sippin' on them juices
They say "Jaden, yeah he's too legit"
And I be flipping cause they slipping
And they dipping in the pool they saying pool
And they be drooling cause I'm super ripped
I might be tripping, but I'm living how I'm living
I'm fourteen, I'll be forgiven
So forget it bro, I'm moving in
I don't care how you be getting all offended
Cause I'm taking all the women
Well I'm sorry bro I do it big
So just listen when I'm spitting
It's the realest that you getting
Of these writtens if you messing with the stupid kid
But if you isn't never get it
Cause I didn't mean to push you
If you want it and you need it girl then come and get it, yeah

[Hook]
It's the coolest

[Verse 2]
I'm the leader of the leaders on the leader boards
We be winning when I'm spitting I don't need the score
I just eat you like a cheetah and it's getting boring
Spitting bars check the blogs if you need some more
MSFTS in this man what's the deal
Me, Moi and Matteo yeah that's the trio
About to get up on the stage cause we feeling ill
Chilling with ebony crew depending upon how I feel
Yeah
Cause the youth is taking over
Baby you can cry up on my shoulder
Sixer season ticket holder
And my flows are only getting colder
And I told yer
The Clique
That there's no other
Please you ain't messing with my Cs in the Suburbs
Getting beats from Ace everyone knows that's my brother
And teachers tell me walk, but I really rather hover in the jamfest

[Hook]
It's the coolest

[Verse 3]
It's the wannabe ghetto kid
Yes I'm about to level with
All of my homies, all of my fellows
It's crazy
Man you messing with the MSFTS
Man I doubt that we gon' settle it
That's because lately
I've been sipping on a soda
And I'm chilling with a hottie and she's really into yoga
My baby, Love notice what I wrote her
And she kiss me on the lips every time a joker show up but, they see
Just a bunch of kids who don't know what love is and think that we should wait 'til we get older, Huh maybe
But, I'd rather swallow throw up cause I'm chilling with my girl and I doubt I'll ever grow up
But, you know what? They ain't gonna slow us up
We the youngest, we the ones that know what's up
I'm an alien my flow is just so abductable
Conspiracy theories never go as up
I'm done



{Intro}
(Piano Playing)

{Verse 1}
To be honest
My conscience is givin' me caution
I'm dealin' with all this nonsense
To be honest...
I'm talkin' to all my aunts and they givin' me bad responses
Girl, Imma be honest....
They got trickery in their pockets
Their hearts are blacker than onyx
And girl, let's just be honest...
I feel like I'm on narcotics
With you I feel so erotic
You know I'm a workaholic...
If your finger nails are still polish
You're plannin' to go to college
Then we shouldn't have to worry...
But you live your life in a hurry
You droppin' out so it's blurry
We fallin' down in a flurry
You serious
You go through these periods
Where you hang with these eerie kids
It's hilarious...
And you call me while you delirous
And tell me how's it goin'
And then I start to get furious
You go up in your room play SIA
Light a candle
I play Bella's Lullaby, while I cry on the piano
People question did I love her
Just know it cuts deeper
Then what all them bracelets cover
And that's very true
And this ain't another cover
This to uncover
All the magic that has happened in the summer
And girl you'll always be my lover
But then the time will come
When you go and find another
But You'll always be my Star

{Hook - Talking}
(Yeah, girl you'll always be my Star)
Man, I remember
(Trust me, you'll always be my Star)
Back in, I don't even remember how old I was
(Girl, you'll always be my Star)
But...
(You'll always be my Star)
(Girl no matter where you are)
(Trust me, you'll always be my Star)
I might of been like 8 when I had my first girlfriend...
Yeah, I guess I've been messin' up ever since...
I don't do it on purpose so...
I guess, I don't know if it's me

{Verse 2}
I want somebody
That can touch my body
Who's lovin' everybody
But's lovin' nobody but me
And nobody can see
What me and her are doin'
On our spare time
That was our time
It isn't their time
And I'm just happy cause it's over
And I'm not the one to looking over my shoulder
Keep it movin' forward
If I'm lookin back I'm gonna cry
And she told that I'm really just selfish kind of guy, uh
Well I guess she know me best
But it didn't feel like it
When her hands were on my chest
I guess, that Costa Rica and Philly was very selfish of me
Well I'm sorry
Girl I'm just silly
And I feel helpless if that's true
Because you know that I'm really so very lonely
When your gone, and we were chillin' until we
Broke Up...
Know what, you was there when I woke up
Got emotions that we can soak up
Girl I can be your soldier
Girl I promise that
And I'll never take that promise back
It wasn't for you I would just kinda rap
Prince Charmin' may come one day
And girl I'm fine with that
But you'll always be my star

{Hook - Outro}
You'll always be my Star

[Refrain]
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?

[Verse 1]
This is my anthem, this is my anthem
My baby, please don't throw a tantrum
I'd love if you'd answer
I'd love if you'd answer, my baby
You know I'm a Cancer, emotional
If I don't know, OSHO should know
Where im supposed to go
Out in the open, exposed
Take off my clothes, take off my clothes

[Interlude]
Whoa...
You don't wanna read a poem when you in the club
With your girls tryna get turnt
In the club with the girls, you in love with the girls
I noticed how you put the work in, girl
You the type of girl to say come through, and you never come
Guess a young thug gotta know what that means

[Bridge]
You just wanna have fun, girl
You don't wanna be the one, girl
You just wanna be a kid, girl
Show me how to live, girl
Girl, I just wanna be a kid, too
You ain't got a lot of issues
Show me how to act, girl
You don't never get mad, girl
But you ain't ever get happy, either
You ain't like that, girl
So in tune like binaural
You ain't care I got a side girl
You ain't like my girl

[Verse 2]
But I like you on the sly, girl
And let's keep it on the sly, girl
Cause on the weekend, I be sleeping with you, baby
We be peeking on a bike, girl
Get a bike, girl and a white girl
Nah, she come from Niburu (Ay)
You know I got you if you need a room (Hey)
Yeah, Jaden be a decent dude (Hey)
Pop out, peek-a-boo, in a cheetah suit
Like dang, girl, we be looking slayin' girl
Wanna watch a movie? Hit Fandango
Watch Django, there he go again, on the train slow
Eating mangoes, so sick broke your ankle
So playful, love learning, but I hate school
And the case is closed
I wander around with no place to go
With no place to go

[Refrain]
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?

[Verse 3]
You just wanna have fun, girl
You know what it is, girl
Show me what it is, girl
Show me, show biz, George Lopez
Four mopeds and my dream girl
Kinda lookin' like my dream, girl
Show you stuff you never seen, girl
Flow sick, nasty, show me how to keep it clean, girl
Sass just like a mean girl
Love you to the moon and nothing in-between, girl
Me and you are so introvert in this dark room
Got a couple poems for you in my arsenal
My cursive verses bend the frequencies
At least we'll see when you start to float
My heart is sold
I got a heart of gold, that turns to charcoal when I'm apart from yours
I'm 'bout to start the tour and my life is yours
You're up in France wearing bright couture

[Bridge] + [Refrain] (overlapping)
(Who am I?)
You just wanna have fun, girl
You don't wanna be the one, girl
You just wanna be a kid, girl
Show me how to live, girl
Girl, I just wanna be a kid, too
(Who am I?)
You ain't got a lot of issues
Show me how to act, girl
You don't never get mad, girl
But you ain't ever get happy, either
(Who am I?)
You ain't like that, girl
So in tune like binaural
You ain't care I got a side girl
You ain't like my girl
(Who am I?)

[Outro]
You ain't like my girl
You ain't like my girl
You ain't like my girl
You ain't like my girl



[Verse 1]
Girl this stuff is ugly
Come right here and love me
Put your cell phone down and don’t put nothing above me
Accept your sexy body, cause I know you wanna touch me
Asking all these questions, he don’t have his license, does he?
Age is just a number, and summer's just a season
See your knees so weak and you don’t even have a reason
Well girl we’ll stop that shaking
Wait until the evening and I'll really give you something to believe in
Girl why are you grieving
Give you a new meaning
Get right in between those precious things that’s in your jeans
Girl how would you know? We’re only teens
Love is something that we only knowing in our dreams
All I really know that baby girl is that it seems
Like we’re having lots of fun and that we make a perfect team
Touching on your body, girl you acting like a fiend
I'mma be your bestest friend that satisfies all of your needs
So just love me like you do

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Love me like you do, love me like you do, like you do
Hold me tight and don’t let go
What am I to do?
When you love me like you do, like you do
Hold me tight and don’t let go

[Verse 2]
I'm here to give you what you need
I can I can give you give you give you what you need
We can walk the park or we can climb up in some trees
Sit you in the shade while we listen to the breeze
Or I'll take you to the movies where they got reclining seats
Or we can take the car to your apartment up the street
If you want to get it started cause my heart is what you need
And it's really up to you there baby girl and that’s for me
Put my hand up on your waist and let you take the lead
As long as I ain't free, as long as I can breathe
As long as you are you, and I can just be me
And when we come together it's like we drowning in some seas
Girl we 'bout to make it happen like you just wouldn't believe
All the stuff that you could lose and you can gain
Girl you got me crazy when you whispering my name
So come right over here and let make you go insane
And I hope you fall in love with all this stuff that I be saying
Girl just love me like you do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All I would ask...
Is you complete your only task
Try to make this last
Girl you know this love could be so vast
As I run my fingers on your back
I know I'm moving fast
Don’t worry bout them kids that’s talking trash
Girl just take my hand
And we’ll forget about the past
Kissing on your neck
Girl I love it when you laugh
And I got you on a roll like we done learn this stuff in class
So just love me like you do

[Hook 2X]



[Hook]
Huh, Hello (hello)
Eh, hello (hello)
How you doing there?
Hello, (hello)
Like, hello, (hello)

[Verse 1]
Like hello, my name is Jaden and I am a young fellow
I like to keep it mellow, I like to make friends and make trends
Attend young school dances, young romances
Girl this is your chance, it’s a long shot
Cupid tried to hit your bow but it’s a long shot
Because I’m tryin to rock the mic and no I won't stop
I’mma keep rappin’ ’bout this love until the song stops
Cause we’re just young and dumb and numb
And lung capacity flung from me in the last city
Um, hon? You one of the last pretty girls that ain’t cash greedy
Models thats mad skinny
You was that bad picky, girl that's a vegetarian
Who hated the movies and loved to go to aquariums
And she would just stare at it barely feeling embarrassed
She put the matic in charis who'd randomly fly to Paris like—

[Hook]
Huh, Hello (hello)
Eh, hello (hello)
How you doing there?
Hello, (hello)
Like, hello, (hello)

[Verse 2]
Greetings this evening—hi, my name is Jaden
These girls are just so deceiving
They see me, they don’t believe I'm a minor
Well I don’t have any gold and all the records I've sold
They thinkin’ I’m really old but
No, I’m a teen, I’m still keeping it clean
I’m having meetings with deans
You see me up on the screen like
Hello, I’m doing this scene, a mean fighting machine
And still keeping it lean like woah
What does this mean? I’m seen in all of these places
My sister just got her braces
My MSFTS is breaking bases, it’s crazy
My clique's the top of the notches
Fans always tryna wave, so Moises is getting noxious
We at the shows, tryna make a mosh pit
Living life so exotic, I’m not tryna be obnoxious
And we trying to paint so now we go into Josh’s
Now we trying skate, we strappin’ on all the costumes like

[Hook]
Huh, hello (hello)
Eh, hello (hello)
How you doing there?
Hello, (hello)
Like, hello, (hello)

[Verse 3]
They say Jaden your vocals, is so cool
Shuttin jokers down as soon as your clique rolls through
Man, we bringing back the old school
If I could, I’d do this without pro tools
Huh, but this is just a intro
Listen up homie if you want some info, I got some details
Sellin jokers out like they was some retails
Couple taxes and emails, talkin’ a lot about females
Hope that doesn’t concern you
Wanna' come up and battle
Well homie, I’mma just burn you
But you gon learn to respect it
You want a real emcee, then check this
Done, MSFTS



[Intro: Jaden Smith]
Yes, I am—hello?
Yes, I am
Yes, I am—hello?
Yes, I am—hello?

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Welcome to my paradise
You can have a pair of dice
You gettin' hungry, we can share a slice
You gettin' uncomfortable like my parents' fights
I'd rather brush it off so I can take you to them Paris lights
I'm the type of kid to cherish nights
'Less I'm trapped in a love that's poisoned with parasites
Now you're gon' tell me you're embarrassed, right?
And now my ego's 'bout as tall as some ferris heights
But now our love's getting scarce
I tried to pray to the love but I seen no doves in the air
Girl I'll go get your mascara
And your Alexander McQueen
So bright, take my hand, we've entered a dream
Can't you tell by the change in the theme?
I'm wearin' ripped up Vans and a hood by Supreme
Guess my subconscious wants me to be a regular teen
Now listen...

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
I get pretty lost in my head
Rather than a dead seed
I try to blossom instead, take notes

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
I swear I'm out of my mind
I swear I'm all out of time
It's only been 5 minutes
I swear I'm out of my mind
Can't get Paris out of my mind
Can't get my parents out of my mind
Man, I swear everybody's like parrots all of the time
They don't listen, infatuated with kissin'
They don't see the 144 dimensions they're missin' but it's fine
She can't put in her weave, I'm really hatin' her attitude
My friends want me to leave, well I'ma do what I have to do
Cause life has really been scarin' me
And nobody's strong enough to come carry me
I'm dealin' with my parents and apparently
They say I qualify for some psychiatrical therapy
I'm out—

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
I get pretty lost in my head
Rather than a dead seed
I try to blossom instead, take notes

[Bridge: Willow Smith]
I'm zoned, I'm zoned, I'm zoned
I'm zoned, I'm zoned, I'm zoned
You should probably take me home
I'm zoned, I'm zoned, I'm zoned

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
You're makin' me crazy
Let's talk about where you're takin' me
Wanna live in your heart but baby is there a vacancy?
We can just make the drive whenever I'm feelin' Vegasy
What's up with the bandanas? Yeah it goes with my legacy
Get it? You probably bold as my agency
Like every night you stay with me I feel like a Navy Seal
Flyin' on a blaine, Mr. David is real
Don't talk about this like it's fun, homie this famous ish kills
Flyin' on a train with no wheels, I made it myself
Magnetize it with a ratchet, cut the chains in a cell
Your brain is a cell, unleash it like the roof of an eagle
Fly in the sky and then go land in Ibiza
And while I'm walkin' to Egypt

[Outro: Willow Smith]
You're makin' me crazy
You're makin' me crazy, you're makin' me
You're makin' me crazy
You're makin' me crazy, you're makin' me



[Verse 1]
I roll with my dawgs
We sip and we fall
We don't listen to y'all
I hit a swisher, we ball, wait
You just a fraud, wait
You just a mirage, wait
I'm in the garage
I need a massage
I'm cookin' the sauce and I'm 'bout to floss
And I'm 'bout to (flex)
I hear the applause, I'm gettin' them cheques
I heard you just hit the road, P West
I guess all this rock and roll shit ain’t a stretch
I'm bout to put Hello Kitty on my neck
Just to show whack rappers how to get it
I slaughtered the beat and I never regret it
I'm signing to Hov just to help with my credit
You get me look, look

[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like a trouble
Sometimes I feel like a rapper
I'm in the 6 with my Raptors
But my boy Roy Backwoods
Pull up on me, a disaster
You get them cheques in you head
Independent to the brain
I think I do insane, yeah
Sometimes I feel like a trouble
Sometimes I feel like a rebel
I'm in the 6 with my Raptors
But my boy Roy backwards
Pull up on me, a disaster
You get them cheques in you head
Independent to the brain
I think I do insane, yeah

[Verse 2]
You still caught up in the game
I don't need a private plane
I just wanna heal the poverty
When it comes to rap, I'm the anomaly
Put a pretty pendant to a prophecy
Sippin' [?] poppin' bottles
We just need to get a Tesla with the throttle
Autopilot 'til tomorrow
Girl you still fed up, don't lie to me
Your body I hit the lottery
I'ma go build me a colony
Speak up I only talk guaponese (ya, ay)
Why can't you wait on the [?], ya
That's just my name in the streets, ya
They call me Jaden the beast, ya

[Bridge]
Hundred grand no misogyny
Hundred grand, diamonds all on me, look
Hundred grand for monogamy
Hundred grand, diamonds all on me
Hundred grand no misogyny
Hundred grand, diamonds all on me
Hundred grand for monogamy
Hundred grand, you should follow me

[Outro]
Hundred grand, need a hunnid
You was walkin', I was runnin'
Come and get it if you want it
Bought Kombucha in abundance
My baby mama like stunnin'
That was none I was stunnin'
Niggas still runnin' from us
I got 'em going bananas



[Verse]
I'm so vibey, man I dare all you jokers to try me
Treat me highly, bout as high as them secret societies
Secret societies, secretly they've all been eyein' me
Christopher Syre, they said that they ready to sire me
Said that they ready to hire me
Well I don't know where all of them flyers be
You not gon' find a mason fly as me
You not gon' find a mason fly as me
I hate you jokers entirely
Sorry but you tire me, you be like "where your tires be?"
But that no gravity Tesla's what I got
And I'm respectful so I'm not gon' tell you what I dropped
But it's hot, it's next on as a text, go get my flex on
Killin' people for oil, it's kinda like you're Exxon
But war's what a joker tryna put an X on
I'ma do it until all my freakin' checks gone
Until my next's gone, and put my decks on eBay and sell 'em
Any MSFTS in the world don't know, go run and tell 'em
Bout to be a rebellion, it's the indigos
It's the indigos, go grab every friend you know
And hold hands 'til you are invincible
Put a forcefield around you, feel it head to toe
And don't stop 'til you jokers think you're cool as eskimos
We are inside you and we're calm and yet connected
And anything offends, at second guess we will deflect it
And anything that's truthful and genuine, we'll accept it
We're the collective and we'll show you to the exit
We're the collective—we'll show you to the exit

[Outro]
Keep, keep, keepin' your love
Keep, keep, keepin' your love
Keep, keep, keepin' your love
Keep, keep, keepin' your love
Keep, keep, keepin' your love
Keep, keep, keepin' your love
Keep, keep, keepin' your love
Keep, keep, keepin' your love

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
If the party on fire then I prolly lit the match
MSFTS my burr and you jokers ain't a match
Scratch, scratch, shkrrrr, man I call that Jazzy Jeff
'Less you with Republic, then I play you to the left

[Verse]
You need a disclaimer, just because these jokers famous
Doesn't mean when they get reckless
That they don't be actin' brainless
You forgettin' I don't even have my license
Cops still pull a joker over cause he light skinned
I ain't really with the wifin'
I just chill with Téo, baby don't forget the hyphen
All nightin', sight seein' errday
I buy a pair of Js just so I can scare the day away
I could care less what the sheriff say
I got a pair of shades and now I'm duckin' from the Paris maid
Probably catch me in a taxi, with some khakis and a cap
I'm tryna run so they don't catch me
Yeah, I'm tryna run so they don't catch me
And you think I got the cash on me,  I'm never lookin' flashy
Dang he never lookin' flashy, rappin' circles 'round these jokers
Man you way too freakin' corny, tag a Urkel on these jokers

[Bridge]
Man I'm trappin' like a hot boy
All my failures crush your successes
Got me flippin' like a skateboard
Get off me, I'm on that next ish

[Hook: Jaden Smith]

[Intro]
I got the fam
Um, I got the tunes
Uh, we got the crystals
We got the candles
Were sitting in a circle, were sitting in a circle
Circles and squares, circles and squares
Erkels and bears, lets go lets go
I'm apprehensive, I don't pay attention
Ahem, Let's go

[Verse 1]
Let the champagne come just for the look of it
Looking for my Misfits they probably playing hooky
That's the freakin' cult if you ain't with it you probably should be
We reppin' all black like the Knight you tried to Suge me
Don't try to push me
I'm not too friendly when my stomachs empty
Battle MC's if they kill me, fans will re-invent me
Diety's to send me stop the cult you see it's empty
Just like the gold that we supposedly had
Heard it was sold to Johnny Depp, then it was sold to my dad
Now it's gone, wait what happened bro? We sold that ish fast
I got the brains on my shoulders I'm the oldest in class
(You have ADD)
Well I can focus at last
I like to thank my Mom and Dad for that trip to the doctor
Now he said I had ADD and now its just awkward
Jaden the awkward what you hear on the stereo
That's what you see when you come to my burial
Bring the chorus, bring the chorus
It's the chorus in your pores that's for sure close the doors
Close the doors, the kids are gonna think of a divorce
Get the porshe keys baby while I button up my shorts
Teo playing different chords like our life was just a score
What's the score? Between the male and the feminine
I say it and it's genuine

[Verse 2]
You can't polish this, that's just common sense
That's what common said
Take my fathers Benz, go retarded zen step and start a trend
Stop and start again, cops are barging in
Cops forgot my friends, lot's of dolphins swim
Serious A serious B it's just Siri and me
You serious G? Kids fearing where them pyramids be
Well under the sphinx they got buckets and sinks
And tree bark that I like to cut when it stinks
Yo Tut what's up with my minks?
Fountain of youth got a cup full of pink
Look around like "yo what's up with my drink?"
I'm having trouble with sleep, 2012 yo what's up with these dreams?
They only stopping when I wake up to pee
And if you wake up to see, the T.V. is full of chaos and chaos
The radio no they don't never play us play us, you know it

[Outro]
You got the lights with you?
Having trouble when I come around
You bring some ice with you?
I keep it subtle but I run the town
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh we the men in black
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh we the men in black
Uh-oh uh-oh  we, we the men in black
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh we the, we the men in black
What's up?



Man, I'm young hotness
You dumb hotness
These jokers hotter than the sun
I get so stupid
MSFTS on them jokers so ruthless
I don't know where the roof is
The truth is
Jaden Smith is probably the smoothest
Making these jokers lose it
Yeah, they couldn't find us
The demons saying and cutting
They pullin' off in some Honda's
Primadonnas
These jokers are rockin' diamonds
I don't care bout diamonds
I make sure where my rhyme is
Our freedoms is what they deny us
Pay women assign us
Ima just keep it honest
Man, Ima just keep it truthful
You kick it and make it useful
A little too hot to handle
Like fingertips on the candle
Hawaii sand in my sandals
The only man on my nano is me
MSFTS well make you scandal
You see us up on the screen
No point in changin' the channel
We cool
No fingerprints on my handle
It's summer in Calabasas
It's way to hot for a flannel
I know
Awards'll stay on my mantel
And people are making fun
But they'll soon know I'm the man in this city
And I don't plan to give pity
My hands are gritty
I'm lookin' for somethin' sexy
Who needs a man to get busy wit'
But girl here's my number
You can hit me up whenever
Cause I'll be here for the summer and
Me and Manny in my Miami
And I really wanna poker
But they raisin' up the ante, so I'm good
Ima focus and just try to win this Grammy
And you know I'm bout to do it
And I'll never have a plan b
Man these girls don't understand me
They don't like the lyrics
They just look at me like candy
But your really fine
So I'll take you somewhere sandy
But you start to hate me
But that really come in handy
Cause I'm bout to dip
Goin' to Hawaii
You can get a plane ticket
But I' really doubt you'll try
Cause you know I gotta bunch of fine models when I ride
I can probably get 'em all
But I'm not that type of guy
Mean I'm not the one for cheating
I'm just always lookin' fly
And you seein' who I be with
When we come up out the sky
And the MSFTS in the evening, and I'll rep it 'til I die
And the joker rockin' zebra
Yeah I said rockin' zebra
Take you to Ibiza
Go see Mona Lisa
Then I'm takin' you to Paris
And the Pyramids of Giza, Uh
Girl we cooler than the fools that be swagged out
That ride with they jags out
And all of they bags out, ha
And just keep it in yo' closet
Don't tell the whole world if you got it
I'm hypnotic, um
I don't care yo' cars exotic
Look at all my women
You be watchin' while we swimmin'
Jacuzzi yeah I'm in it
All the states that we just been in
And I'm sippin' tiger blood cause
Lil' homie I be winnin'
You offended, yeah
And I'm sorry you ain't here
Re-incarnation is Shakespeare
Just a few little things that I wanted to make clear
Cause I'm right at the top And I'm plannin' to stay here



[Verse 1]
Listen, my clique is vicious
Don't get it twisted, we wicked

Really only my friends know
Cause it's 'bout as dark as that tint goes

[Jaden Smith - Verse 1]
Your motion
Got me rollercoastin
I want all in your ocean
Man look it when I goes in
I have no friends
But if you had seen where we came
You would know that we’re just makin a name
Just off Deck and we straight to a plane
Man, I’m insane
This ain’t a game
Half of you jokers don’t hear what I’m sayin
But this is real, I’m feelin pain
All of the things, I don’t say them in vain
Great as a dane, you in my domain
I can be Batman and you could be Bane
Fast as a train, sharp as a brain
I am a poet, I do not explain
These are my feelings, I don’t entertain
Keepin it plain, my take, it look like I’m me
You don’t know what I attain
When I drop flame
I knew I conquered the game
All of these jokers are lame
So tell them to stay in they lane
I spit the fire, you out of the frame
I’m killing em dang man, you thought I would lose?
Who’s this kid with the Louie V shoes?
That would be me and I’m here with my crew
And you not so I think I’mma need a masseuse
Boom, man this what I do
No paper, no pad
Here with my girl and these jokers are mad
You got GPS? Cuz It could’t been bad
I would’ve been lost

[Willow Smith - Hook]
Lost...
In space and I see your face on Mars
No trace but I find you in them stars
I’ll chase you til this planet falls
Lil mama got bars, Lil mama got bars

(Chorus x2)
You stare into my eyes, I know you hear my cries
‘Cause you look at the sky
You wanna fly? I got the kite
I got the kite for you to fly

(Verse)
I gave you kisses on yo neck
And chilled after my curfew
I treat you with respect
And girl I never would hurt you
But now, I’m with my G’s
Skatin these streets, baby I’m killin this beat
Fly like the birds and the bees
Please, go get some Z’s
Roll up my sleeves, go to the cosmos
Come back and got a new God flow
Gotta find one in Kabo
Until these jokers know I ain’t macho
No, I’m straight from the basas, I’m skippin my classes
These jokers slow as molasses
My song is massive
Wanna know where all the trash is? Visit them ratchets
Fly as Aladdin, I am so cool you could call me Alaskan
I am the freshest, there’s no point in askin
Live on the edge and you’ll live in your casket
I am the baddest yea
And I’m gon find me a actress
With long hair, nice skin, does backflips
And red lips and she don’t need chapstick
But I’mma be here with my clan
Soon as you land, you got flowers in your hand
Come to the beach, get a tan
Lay in the sand, baby you hot as a pan
Come with the tightest bikini, you eat the Panini cuz baby you can
I’ll be your genie cuz I am your man
Say that I’m dreamin, you hear me like damn
You got me lost

(Bridge)
Lost in space and I see your face on Mars
No trace but I find you in them stars
I’ll chase you til this planet falls
Lil mama got bar, lil mama got bars

(Chorus x2)
You stare into my eyes, I know you hear my cries
‘Cause you look at the sky
You wanna fly? I got the kite
I got the kite for you to fly

Lost
Lost
Lost



[Verse:]
Girl tell me that I'm sexy, if you think I am
Alice drank the drink and pushed me in the sink again
Threw up on my Cuban links, I'll never drink again
Talkin' 'bout the ancient world, well girl let's bring the Incas in
Let's travel back in time and then we'll build the Sphinx again
Then we'll find some furry trees and then we'll make some minks with them
Ahhhh, what a nice Sunday
I'll get the gun out of Holden's hands one day
Until then, me and you can have a real fun day
Ridin' in a Hyundai, what? We can kick it on a runway
Please don't listen to your teachers
I'm tryna get rid of all the nonsense that they teach us
Football practice but I'm sittin' in the bleachers
Yes lord tryna make it sound like I got features, but I don't
But all the secrets, man they chillin' in the flower
I swear that I could sit and talk to Drunvalo for hours
But you should know that Muvico will open for us hourly
Speakin' to me sourly and trust I will devour
Continental drift and the next pole shift
Continental drift and the next pole shift
Continental drift and the next pole shift
I ain't worried 'bout the science, I'm just glad we coexist
Runnin' out of time, you could read it on her wrist
Picture that you missed cause I'm chillin' with your miss
If you call this coexistin'
Then you don't really know the system
If you really knew, it'd probably make you mad enough to go and freakin' choke your sister
Who killed the dang electric car? I got a broken Fisker
Me and Obi Wan Kenobi went to find Jarobi
Lowkey I'm just kinda nervous to chill with an OG
They probably wrote me down in journals as one of the greatest
So when I leave this world, I want you to make me a trophy
And when I say make me trophies don't make me no trophy
I want you to soak me in gold and make me a trophy
And hopefully, you jokers'll know it's me
Cause when I leave this world, I'ma leave with some poetry
And I'm out



{Verse 1}
Uh, Yo, Aye
Spit fire can't jock my heat
Hear my spit fire knock the streets, yo
Tic toc can't stop my feet
Hear a real G rock the beat, uh
Had a fun time last night
Got girls here that's right
Could've chilled if you act right
Fell asleep on my half-pipe, yeah
Got school but we coolin', Aye
Let the cool kids do this, uh
And flows be too sick, eh
So cool you droolin', yup
Yup, yup I does it
This my city right here

Pass me a deck quick, quick pop shovit
Girls be sayin' I was with 'em but I wasn't
Cause...

{Hook}
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Why, Everybody tryna get like me

{Verse 2}
Wanna know where to find me
Find a place where the most skateboards, scrape concrete
With my G's behind me, yeah
We ain't afraid of non the zombies
More peace than Gandhi
Up all night, never sleep
You can call me a zombie, Ah
Bringin' it way back
Before I got to cruise
With my dad playin' tracks in the Maybach
Now I'm king of the MSFTS
So are my G's
Moi's king of the kick-flips (Dope)
And must be the raps I spit
To get invited to these parties
With all these hot actresses, yo
I ain't even mad at this
But, I'll probably get some crap for this
From parents and my sis
And the people I be actin' with
But it's cool Ima act a trip
Cause...

{Hook}
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Why, Everybody tryna get like me

{Verse 3}
People say "be safe" and I hate that
So I go to skatelab with no pads
Ha, ha rebel
Ever skate hard betta get up on our level
If you can't then it's no problem
If you want decks then we got 'em
Lookin' up like there's no bottom
Spittin' flows hotter than lava
New York meetings with Hova
Then go to Nobu with Shaka
These girls are thinkin' I'm older
Then break it to 'em shock 'em
Told you I was the realest
Swag bustin' through ceilings
And O told me to kill it
So what did I do I killed it
Cause...

{Hook}
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Why, Everybody tryna get like me
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Why, Everybody tryna get like me



[Verse 1]
Why's a boy going through a man experience?
I know I hear them voices but all them voices hearing this
People label me delirious
Thoth  said he built the pyramids
So imma aim high to the moon to be exact
Imma just go and cry up in my room to be exact
And the pyramids were made
They're not a tomb to be exact
And more of a frequency like a flute
Or a saxophone
I grabs my phone and call my father
He was up in Dubai then drove to Sharjah
And grabbed a car charger
And let's get rolling
As he whippin the Tahoe like it's stolen
Golden spiral, let's get viral, hieroglyph
The high road is, the life I live, the life I'll give
To my MSFTS if they were ever questioned
Stand back and watch the re-election
Little joker

[Interlude]
Uh, me and Teo are still tweakin the hook a little bit
So here's the second verse

[Verse 2]
What is this?
Watching pigeons fly
Wearing some vintage clothes they got from the dentist
Don't ask me, I'm just a witness
Watching 24 fitness close
Put on some clothes before I can say a sentence
My dad complain about my wind-tints
Say that they gon pull me over on the verge in this
Man, you talking about the equinox
Well yeah we turnin this
Money, yeah we're earnin this
Oil, yeah we're burnin this
Kylie  lookin' at me saying Jaden why you learning this?
Hotter than some furnaces
Man, I'll never learn to fit
Man, they sayin' Jaden's tripping
Man, I'll never learn to sit
Man, I'll never learn to quit

[Outro]
Young and the reckless



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Man I met her on Monday
Went on Twitter, had her number by Tuesday
That's how I get it usually
Batman, black man on this Bruce Wayne
Please don't confuse me
You chilling on Wednesday
Come with me I don't care what your friends say
I'm running on empty
No worries, we goin' hop up on the Bentley
I rub your thigh gently
X-Man he resenting me
You wanna meet my mom on Friday
I said sorry that's my day
Kick it on the sly or the highway
And I bring us to the next thing
And you trynna check me
Telling I ain't text her
Communication, homie trust me i'm an expert

[Hook: Willow Smith]
Electric love

[Bridge]
It's that electricity
Don't care about your ethnicity
Girl let's get busy
Girl let's get busy

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
I haven't seen you in some months
My friends tell me that you're spun off of summer
Cause you're having fun
But girl tell me when it's done
Cause I know imma get it when it comes
Well baby girl you can't run
Cause you know I pay attention when it rung
It was only three times little mommy
I ain't stupid, I ain't dumb
Imma wait until you come to pappy
Make you fall in love
Lady you can't stop me
You wanted other guys
Sorry, they can't top me
Cause I'm still a movie star
Even if they flop, see
I'm not cocky, i'm confident
And I don't see anything wrong with it
Well all your friends here girl they non-legit
I'm non-offensive
Let's get on with this
It's all electric

[Hook]
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Had to stop in the middle of the hook
Cause baby girl you got me hooked
Know you sexy I ain't even got to look
Cause girl I read you like a book
Now please girl tell me what you took
Put a red, bottom of your foot
And you chilling like a model in the cut
J, do you pop bottles in the club?
No, I don't like the party and the owner of the club
No, I don't really listen to it unless it's a
Love song, now she trynna fight
Jaden put your gloves on
What a waste of water
We already had the tub going
Little better than the last fight
Little harder than the first one
Zone out when the hook here
Go crazy when the verse come
Gone when the worst come
Instagraming when your shirts come
And she said she Norwegian
Been a minute since I've been up in that region
And girl stop teasing
Camouflage and I ain't really do cheesing
And a joker straight steezing
Come to see you
I don't need to have a reason
And wear all black
Feeling like a seasoning
And if you give me butt
I'm gonna squeeze it
And i'm out

[Hook]
Electric love
Electric love

[Intro]
Young, young - fresh, fresh
Reckless, reckless - reckless, reckless

[Verse 1]
Young, reckless, hit you, put some ice on it
Got a bet, homie, roll some dice on it
Yeah, I'mma ball, mamacita you look nice on it
O, and Chaos made the beat, but Teo put some spice on it
Yeah, yeah, my vocal sound nice on it
Yeah, gets really cold her at night, don't it?
Yeah, because you chilling with the coldest
Man, I spit you knowledge cause you need to know this
Man, you listen to these lyrics, you say kill the kid that wrote this
Man, I write my opus, man, my book is open
All you jokes lokers, hokus pokus, sexy models poke us
You disloyal punks, you laughing, I don't understand your jokes
But I'mma keep it moving
How you gon' tell us that we not the dopest?
Jab you in the face just to show you where the rope is
Man, you talking future, homie, we probably the closest
But why this girl texting me asking where all her clothes is?
I'm losing my focus, these rhymes are provoking
My arms are convulsing, how many times have I wrote this?
Wait, I think I'm straight losing my memory
But that'll be the thing that make sure you remember me
You jokers stupid like drinking Hennessy, go to Tennesse
Think you better than me? Well, homie, let's just wait and see

[Hook]
Cause I'm young, young - fresh, fresh
Then we reckless, reckless - reckless, reckless
Young, young - fresh, fresh
Then we reckless, reckless - reckless, reckless

[Verse 2]
I flip words like light flips of a disco
Got a problem then let's go, shooting of like a pistol
You gon' make it rain, well, I ain't afraid of no drizzle
You keep rizzle, I keep you checked with the shizzle
Drop it all just to go pre-order the trizzle
Cause you don't know jack about that Tesla
Cause I just came back with my fresh cut
So guess what, man, I'm walking with my chest up
The butterfly doors make a joker look fresh, huh
Johnny Depp steez, get off of the steps please
We get all the fish in the sea cause we on jetskis
Smith cool as the Gretsky's, we back back in the West Indie's
Making some fresh tee's where the pigs can't arrest me
Your mic dusty, you sure rusty, you jokers must be
On vacation cause you can't touch me, it's ugly
I flip words like kickflips in the 'burbs
Like nothing you've never heard, a Jazzy Jeff when he turns
Man, this kid is absurd, where'd he get all these words?
Probably from them stupid books he's reading
And imprints on his shirts
Like you don't know jack about that new school
Jokers from way back complaining we too cool
We reckless



[Chorus]
I guess we just some melancholy souls
That's why we spit these melancholy flows
Wear these melancholy clothes
Bring this melancholy everywhere he goes
Everywhere he goes

[Verse 1]
Man you guys are just some rich kids
How dare you call yourself the misfits
Hope you get coals in your presents come Christmas
Man I'm sorry, I ain't eat today
Cause I didn't know what I should eat today
Full or hungry, don't know what the difference is
I just hope we work out all our differences
Cause I be flyin' where them pigeons is
I mean it's all opinion, but

[Chorus]
I guess we just some melancholy souls
That's why we spit these melancholy flows
Wear these melancholy clothes
Bring this melancholy everywhere he goes
Everywhere he goes

[Verse 2]
And they tell me just to breathe
(Breathe, breathe in the air, don't be afraid to care)
Oh you rappin' on this? I bet you thought you'd body this
You messin' up a classic, how you did with The Karate Kid
Bro but what the heck was I to do?
Now I see why Pia didn't sign with you

[Chorus]
I guess we just some melancholy souls
That's why we spit these melancholy flows
Wear these melancholy clothes
Bring this melancholy everywhere he goes
Everywhere he goes

[Verse 3]
But they tell me just to run
(Run, rabbit run, dig that hole, forget the Sun)
Oh you say you want some more?
Well your father paid for all of this
If I was rappin' like you I would help the world and call it quits
And I just rap at you anonymous
I hide behind my hate because I wish I had your confidence
But understand, my only option is
To go to school and try to be friends with all these obnoxious kids
I don't hate you, I'm jealous of how you got to live
I'm sittin' here in class and my teacher's about to pop a quiz



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Mmmmm
Coming in like a violin
Usually not one to go and get violent
You friends say he's on top of the world
So I had them knock him down so them jokers wouldn't try again
Tell the pants I never lie again
Paparazzi they always spying in
Biggest question do he have a girlfriend?
Well I don't know
All I know is my clothes are fresher than trident
And my flows are flyer than what I'm flying in
Hold on give me a second cause I'm flying in
So corrupted and all you jokers denying it
Why is it when I do it than all of you is just trying it
Cause I'm as flawless as a diamond
All day shining while you catching my timing
This Cartier you eyein' it
Your friends and family done lied to you
I'm successfully doing what you've been trying to do
It's what it is when rhythm kicks it inside of you
Sorry little homie I got to do what I got to do
I'm looking down at the ground shake
You saying it's heavy it's like a pound cake
I'm a king I swear homie my crowns late
Not only you look like a poser but bro you sound fake

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Mmmmm
You ain't ready for the release
Run the city I did it all with my cleats
Want to know about my life well than go and listen to streets
And give me some space while a little joker killing beats
And filling these seats
Yeah little Jaden he reeks
Cause every rapper he meets he beats now they deceased
Don't believe the conspiracies look up and you can see
There's streaks all in the sky, been studying up for weeks
Jeez, got fluoride all in my fleece
So many white lines like Hollywood in its peak
Please, I dare you to even speak
Being me's probably the highest goal I could reach
I don't really care how my tires flow when they screech
People say "Jaden, you're going to die alone" but I preach
But my soul will never deplete
So when you arrange my funeral please just save me a seat
For real
I kill jokers running on my heels
I peel away from Interscope I running from a deal
I kneel to the world they won't put me on sale
I bail from the prison now my mind is like a jail
I swear
Living life without care
Orgone energy in the air
Like a flare I'm on fire
Misfits attire
Names Christopher Syre
And a joker take you higher
And I'm out

[Outro]



[Intro]
What you doing here?
Girl, who let you here?
Can I whisper in your ear?
Cause I really kinda need you near
And my mom said you couldn’t come over
Didn't really care when you pulled up in the rover
Said that I should wait, wait till I got older
But love is a war and maybe I’m your soldier (swag)

[Verse 1]
At the crib like you’re here to see Willow
Everybody know that you’re here to see Smith-o
Willow's been in Philly for the last couple weeks
She’s just chilling there with Gammy
Cause she really loves the east
But I’m in Cali where the sun come
The city of angels and trust me baby, you’re one of them
Upcoming artist? I’m sorry, I don’t know none of em
Msfts tee, I’m sorry hun if you wanted one
I’m just playin, you can have it
Most exclusive jacket that we've got
Don’t worry girl, you can swag it
I be looking dumb? Sorry girl, that’s a habit
Your body was just around, you make me wanna come grab it
People say my lyrics are explicit
But really they're just vivid
Cause when I hang with you I’m always thinkin bout kissing
And my house is like a heaven, I’d love for you to come visit
And listen.. to the smooth track
Aye girl, get your dude back
Man, why’d you go and do that?
Get up in my face and you ruined the mood up
Jeez, told the girl “don’t worry”
I can get him gone, I just got to tell Siri
Security came running through the hall in a hurry
And took em so fast, it was almost kinda blurry, see?

[Hook]
Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie (lie)
You wanna get in my room
I knew you was gonna try
But before you was actin’ all shy
And I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why


[Verse 2]
I got what you need, come take it if you want
Girl, come make it if you want
I don’t care what you wear, come if you want
Even though I couldn’t say it it’s basically what I want
So.. I’m just bugging girl
But the funny part is you know that I wasn’t, girl
I’m just really lonely, I need someone’s loving girl
And you make me so hot
And that’s why it feels like an oven girl
And I think I know why

[Hook]
Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie (lie)
You wanna get in my room
I knew you was gonna try
But before you was actin’ all shy
And I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why

[Interlude]
Aye girl, if you up your room right now
Listen to this song—I’m right there with you
Just let me hold you, take my hand
Just rock with me, girl, just rock with—

[Hook]
Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie (lie)
You wanna get in my room
I knew you was gonna try
But before you was actin’ all shy
And I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why
(Why? Why? Why?)
Girl, I think I know why

[Verse 3]
Put your head up on my shoulder
"Girl I’m bout to kiss you"—yeah, that’s what I told her
So we getting close, only getting closer
And I’m waiting for the kiss till I said “hold up”
I’m O.K. that you are older
I just need you on my side when I roll up in that Bentley
And these jokers just resent me
When you met me I was empty
And I’m bout to win a Grammy and these jockers wanna friend me but I’m gone now



[Hook]
They take us to London
They take us to France
They take us to Rio
They take us to France
They take us to Sweden
Then we back to France
But that be where we go, they know exactly who I am
Baby girl cuz we the MSFTS! MSFTS! MSFTS!
Come kick it with the MSFTS! MSFTS! MSFTS!
Yea homie we the MSFTS! MSFTS! MSFTS!
You rockin’ with the MSFTS! MSFTS! MSFTS!
Give it to em

[Verse 1]
Old people say that we’re dumb
Young people say that we’re fun
Um hum
You should probly bite on your tongue
Say that we lost but we won
Um hum
Chewin' jokers up like gum, yum
Put it in my tum, done
And headphones beating like a drum
Throwin paper up, I don’t care about the sum
I mean I don’t really care about the money
MSFTS dark when it’s sunny, funny
I’m so fly that you’re looking like a dummy
I’m so cool that your nose stay running
That’s funny
We young and reckless
MSFTS live life on the edges
Crazy.. nobody can catch us
My sub drops and we on the sat list
Amazing.. reckless and love it
We got cool that you never been up with
We’re MSFTS, this is our republic
And I act wild even when I’m in public

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m not no poser
But a joker do like the pose
MSFTS in this with some new clothes
And I just left state to do some more shows
I’m the coolest, that case is closed
Got a new girl, we'll see how it goes
Dressed all black from our head to toe
When you see my clique we lookin like crows
Cuz we young and stupid
Yea, we dumb and ruthless
Man you know who the crew is
Lose so much of the jokers abusing the losin
Man I’mma be cruising
My girl, she snoozing
I really don't care whose in the house
As long as they bumpin the music
'Bout to walk in with the clique, wuzzup
Look so fly cuz we all dressed up
And they moshin' to the music
Cuz the MSFTS know what's up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you reckless.. then you a Msft
If you rejected.. then you a Msft
If you not nothing to mess with.. then you a Msft
If you get this.. then trust me, you a Msft
If you breaking all the rules.. then you a Msft
If people think you ain’t cool.. then trust me you a Msft
If you wanna be rebellious, homie come and follow me
And I’m lookin at my haters, we say RIP
Little homie we the MSFTS

A Msft is someone who creates, inspires and disrupts
Cuz when you stop believing, your parents will start deceiving
You and all your friends tell you stop leaving
When you should get the decks and go skate the streets this evening
Words hurt, like a bee sting
It’s kinda like a disease but to them it’s pleasing
Instead of doing all the pleasing
You should get the keys and be gone like the wind in the trees
Agreed?
A Msft is a rebel, we standing out
Like we rocks in the middle of some
Pebbles
You jokers corny, let me put you in a kettle
You poppin for like a minute, let me wait for you to settle
Hello! Get up on my level
Who thought the littlest fellow would nominee for these medals?
You look good in those stilettos
Sing a lullaby to you like Bella's
And all these ladies is jealous
Oh I’mma get my fellows in
Settle down and say something intelligent
Hello kids, I’m not saying don’t get your college degrees
I’m not saying to go and skate and break your knees
I’m not saying to go up in your house and get the keys and
Run away without telling your parents that you gon leave
I’m not teling you to be me
I’m just telling you you could be free
Geez



[Intro]
Aah, I said aah
Said aah
I like this, aah

Hot spitter of the century
Said you wanted hot bars
So elected me
Young black with accessories
And I'm doing well
Never seen a penitentiary
Cause they can't sentence
The greatest MC they ever seen
No I'm not, but if you gon' battle me
Then you better be
Still got a couple million
Still in elementary
Talk about to blow
Eh, let them be

Just 13, tryin' to live my life
Got in trouble for it once
But I just did it twice
Man there goes Will's kid
Walking in the Hilton
And my name's Jaden
Get it right
But homie I'm just trying to spread some light
Ah so I can go to sleep at night
Cause right now I'm really restless
Flirting with my extras
Worryin' bout who was on the guest list
Who's rockin' wit nextest
Who's verse is the bestest
Is it competition?
Cause I'm surely gon' wreck this

Ah, ain't no doubt about it
Saw I was at the top
So all them jokers reroute it
All these people are crazy
These rumors is gettin' so crowded
That's just because we are famous
And you don't know nothing bout it

Ah, nothing has a price tag
In the back of my car
Soon as I say like that
You can take the fame
Homie just give the mic back
After you spit your optional verse
Cause they might clap
Yeah girl I know you like that
Jaden I'm a young boy
Killing on the right track
Yeah got some tricks up my sleeve
They were nice raps
I just wanna be there
When you takin' off that night cap

Yeah so call me when you tryna kick it
I'll be with Mateo
Livin' how all the bosses live it
Probably at Rodeo buying same
But the cost is diferrent
Louis is the tailor
But I gotta rock the Carsons with it

[Outro]
Skater at the heart
Artist at the soul
Lusting for these women
That's the hardest to control
And if you met me once
I'm no modest, I'm just cold
I'm so hot the sun is old
I ain't honest, I'm just bold
Give it to 'em
MSFTS, tell them I'm outta here
MSFTS



It’s a ..
It’s been a.. it’s been a second since I seen you
And uh.. when I get my own place I guess we’re
Gonna kick it again but..
I don’t really know
What’s right for us cuz..
Mateo is tryna..
I mean we’re all kinda...
Miss what all of us had before and I’m not
Saying that..
I’m begging for your back that is

(First Verse)
I dropped a song our anniversary
Half of your friends ain’t even heard of me
They know me as a kid.. that’s more closed than the curtains be
You want me back, well that’s working out perfectly
Your lips are just so perfect and it hurts to be the kid that broke your heart
It’s not on purpose man
I done it since the nursery
Do you like me? Well certainly
And then she falls in love
And it’s kinda like a curse for me
I don’t say this stuff with certainty
I just wanna have fun
There’s no need for all the urgency
Cuz these ladies always burning me
I’m learning every time that I’m concerned it’s an emergency
But girl I’d rather go emergencies
And feel your body cuz I know you’re been in search of me
Girl it’s been a while so now I know that you’re sure with me
So come and take my hand
Cuz I wanna be the first to be with you

(Chorus)
Broken hearts that drown in underwater
Hoping I bring em up to solid ground
Tryna swim ashore but it’s getting so much harder
Knowing that the one I love is not around

She’s not around
She’s not around babe
She’s not around
She’s not around baby
She’s not around
She’s not around baby
She’s not around
She’s not around right now
She’s not around

(Second Verse)
I think I’m liking someone else
But I don’t wanna hurt you so I’m right here by myself
And I think that I’mma search you on the social media
Giddy up, straight meeting up
Chilling with your sister
Bout to text, you say I miss you but..
A joker’s talking with his fist up
Cuz now I got you mad bout them numbers that I picked up
But I ain’t even messing with nobody
Chest is heavy, I ain’t been confessing to nobody
Man you know they know we broke up
They ain't let me see they body
This girl told me, she said texting me’s a hobby
And of course Kennedy mad
Man she mad all the time
Like all my enemies mad
She’s so mad, she probly pretend to be mad
But it’s really sad for your oldest friend to be sad
But at least I said all my goodbyes
So she has a bit of closure in the pillow when she cries
But I’m sorry

(Chores)
(Chorus)
Broken hearts that drown in underwater
Hoping I bring em up to solid ground
Tryna swim ashore but it’s getting so much harder
Knowing that the one I love is not around

Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
I got you if it’s too much
You can take it off if it’s too much
Just tell me if it’s too much
We don’t gotta do much
Tell me if it’s..

If it’s too much
Then I’ll just hold you and unfold you til I can find the old you
When we were so connected
Our privacy so protected, my thoughts are getting so hectic
Words carefully selected
Teens love each other so reckless
I couldn’t say where my head is
Is it too much?
Cuz if it is we can take our broken hearts right up the stairs
Ignorin all our peers
We hide the fact that we some secret lovers
But we show it all, we’ll be under the covers
Baby girl cuz..

If it’s too much
I got you if it’s too much
You can take it off if it’s too much
I got you if it’s too much, if it’s too much

If it’s too much I’ll put my hand right down your face and make it to your waist
Baby girl cuz if it’s too much
You won't have nothing to chase
Won't even have no space
Baby girl cuz this is too much
So my lips is what you’ll taste
And if it’s too much
We gon do it how we did it
Up on zoomer baby girl
But is it..?

Too much
Is too much
Baby is it too much?
Is it too much? Tell me if it’s too much
Baby is it too much? Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Don’t be worried when it’s too much
Just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s..
Tell me if it’s..
Just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s..
Cuz I got it if it’s too much
We can take it if it’s..
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
Let’s spend a couple weeks
So we got it if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s..
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
Too much
Girl just tell me if it’s too much
It’s too much....



[Verse One: Jaden Smith]
Some would say that I was lost
Will someone tell me if I’m lost ‘cause I’m lost
If you saw us, you should see us in the stars
Spitting bars with my dogs, (?)
Fly at all costs
And I’m not one to get involved
I’mma kick it, then I’m off
I'm not slipping in your draws
I don’t care about the laws, I spit bars, get tossed
Joker, I’m a boss
So hit soft, I live soft
Not even from this planet
They won’t understand it till they see me vanish
I put you jokers in panic
You can’t admit it, don’t catch my plane ‘cause it landed
I’m sorry, where are my manners like…
I’mma give you a breath of that nextness
See young prep taking a step ‘cause my chest gets heavy
When you re-rapping except
When you gon’ spit the real ‘cause I’ma give you what's left of
Me and these jokers’ll never finish me
Give ‘em all my imagery
They too caught up in Hennessey
Huh, well I’ll be keeping my dignity
And every time you talking, you jokers never gon’ mention me
But my steeze is 100 degrees
Said he at the school getting D’s
I do it with ease
MSFTS read it on our tees
And we stay up in the palace like you just wouldn’t believe like jeez

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Tell me who’s all ready to go, who’s all ready to go
Higher up, higher up, said higher up
Tell me who’s all ready to go, who’s all ready to go
Higher up, higher up, said higher up

[Verse Two: Jaden Smith]
Uhh
Don’t ain’t nobody know
But my clique cover like ghost
Chilling in the rolls
Scheme falls close and then we expose ya
Wear the same clothes everyday like you supposed to
I’m just a kid who’s not really a kid
And told some really bad fibs
It’s hard to forgive
Man, I’m sorry mom and dad, I’m just tryna live
Tell ‘em buggers if they see me, get out of my business
What is this, MSFTS?
They rich kids
I spit the quickness
I beat you, it’s only physics
You want this stuff
And I live it
I live on the moon, come visit
Your cliché description, I’m sorry dawg, I don’t fit it, I’m different
Dawg I wear dresses this, I’m not upset, you don’t mess with my style
‘Cause this stuff’s aggressive
I keep it reckless
No diamond ring or a necklace
So while you jokers keep hating, I write myself on the set list
I don’t care that I’m not accepted with who you thinking at is cool
Or who be rappin the freshest
Huh, I’ll always just be neglected, dang

[Outro]
Man I make this music for y’all and no one really messes with me like that
But like who needs them, for my republic, I stand, MSFTS over all

[Hook]



[Hook]

Is it butterflies for the first time?
First time, first time
I feel like I can fly for the first time
First time, first time

It's the first time that I try to read your mind
And you've heard mine
And this love will be sadder than when the birds cry
And I think that it's great but is it worth dying for?

[Verse 1]
Girl this love hurts
And you were my first
And deep down inside I hope you're my last one
I just hope that we're ok when all of this cash comes
Cause we know it's coming
My money's runnin (runnin)
My money's runnin (runnin)
Girl our future is as sunny
Girl I really like it, you ain't askin nothing from me
And it's funny
Baby won't you just come here and be my honey (be my honey baby)
Baby you drivin me crazy
Making me so hot when you roll up in that 'Cedes
Girl you are so fine, blow me back into the 80's
And I like your dirty dancing, let me be your Patrick Swayze (Patrick Swayze)
Girl you're pretty as a daisy
You be my Beyonce and I be your Jay-z
I can be your wolf girl, you can be my Haley
And I asked you why you runnin'
You said just so you can chase me
And let's have a good time

[Hook]
Is it butterflies for the first time?
First time, first time
I feel like I can fly for the first time
First time, first time

It's the first time that I try to read your mind
And you've heard mine
And this love will be sadder than when the birds cry
And I think that it's great but is it worth dying for? Is it?

[Verse 2]
Is it?
It doesn't make a difference to me girl so just listen
Cause this is something that you get in your dreams girl
You're so pretty
I'm hanging with you but I'm so busy
And it's so trippy
That were moving so fast in such a slow city
But you said baby lay me down
I don't even know when this is crazy wild
This love was hot and now you about to take me down
You got some secrets well baby girl you should say them now
Cause the sun is setting on the beach
And it's probly gon' get chilly
Well, good thing I brought some sheets
Baby girl you are so pretty, I don't think we'll ever leave
I don't know what's gonna happen
Guess we'll have to wait and see
Cause I got them butterflies

[Hook]
Is it butterflies for the first time?
First time, first time
I feel like I can fly for the first time
First time, first time

It's the first time that I try to read your mind
And you've heard mine
And this love will be sadder than when the birds cry
And I think that it's great but is it worth dying for? No

[Verse 3]
What is pure?
People walk around so insecure
Fraid that you said the word it, it hurts
As soon as you had your first it's like you bearing a curse
But girl I'll protect you
I'm always next to you girl
I respect you
I'll never let you loose No
Girl I'll never let you
If you run away best believe I'mma come get you
Girl I bring you love ever since I met you
I remember you were sneezing
You said achu I said bless you
I'll just get you, uhh
Girl, and I know you get me
Ever since you met me
All those texts you sent me
Wasn't lookin for love, just lookin for someone friendly
And I got it, I was younger
I was asking for a Bentley and I got it
Now we're vibin super sexy
And she's textin while we drivin
Want some Ti$a, want some Gucci
Want some Fendi then we got it

[Hook]
Is it butterflies for the first time?
First time, first time
I feel like I can fly for the first time
First time, first time

It's the first time that I try to read your mind
And you've heard mine
And this love will be sadder than when the birds cry
And I think that it's great but is it worth dying for?



[Verse 1]
You remember last November
Or was it October, You was over
Oh this getting colder
It’s the middle of December, embers burning, wheels were turning
And I was yearning for you
Girl, I’m usually a player but tonight I’m turning for you
Girl I couldn’t even speak that night
You remember I had to beach that night
There was no one on the street that night
Rolled up, I was looking like a creep that night
Then you came inside my tent, to come and get me
And you whispered in you asked if I was ready
And I wasn't, but girl

[Hook]
All I wanna do, is take my time with you
So if this love is true
Then you wait for the two of us
All I wanna do is take my time with you
So can we keep it cool?
Cause baby this is new

[Bridge]
Wanna be my girlfriend, and my lover but I’m just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend, and my lover but I’m just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend, and my lover but I’m just not ready
Oh no I’m just not ready, oh no I’m just not ready

[Verse 2]
Girl you 'bout to get me in some drama
Feeling like a storm coming
And I know you’re dealing with these problems
And I know there’s more coming
And you doing how you can
Hope you know I really understand
I just gotta be the realest while I can
Cause it’s a little joke as chance
Things spread like cancer
On the canvas, Baby girl let’s ride
Take her to the spot on the top and we never gonna stop
Show me what you got, never gonna dry
No, girl we never gonna' stop
Cause I want to make it lastlast
Don’t worry bout them jokers in the class
Cause he's always talking trash
I’mma put him in the past
I'm in the Beamer and I kinda got it going really fast

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I’m cool as the wind blows
Please open up a window
Cause it’s hot in here
And it’s cold when you’re not in here
Your body rocking, got a headache
I’ma lay you down cuz my body getting heavy
Girl you should drop it like it’s hot cause I’m ready
And I’mma lean it, but only if you let me
Come into my villa like get it
You can be my cougar like Freddy
Krugger, you ready?
Something you can show me
You can be my friend
You can be my homie
You can come and hold me, cause I’m really lonely
And we could do it fast or we could do it slowly (Holy crap)
You don’t even know me, on Twitter call me a phony
When it’s time you gone faster than ?

[Hook]

[Bridge]



To be honest, my conscience giving me caution
I'm dealing with all this nonsense
To be honest, I'm talking to all my aunts
And they giving me bad responses
Girl, I'm a be honest
They got trickery in their pockets
They're hearts are blacker than onyx
And girl, let's just be honest
I feel like I'm on narcotics with you
I feel so erotic
You know I'm a workaholic
If your fingernails are still polished
You're planning to go to college
Then we shouldn't have to worry
That you live your life in a hurry
You drivin out so it's blurry
We fallin down in a flurry
You serious... you go through these periods
When you hang with these eerie kids
It's hilarious
And you call me while you're delirious and tell me
How it's going and then I start to get furious
You go up in your room, play Ciel, light a candle
I play Bella's Lullaby while I cry on the piano
People questioned that I love her
Just know it cuts deeper than what all
Them bracelets cover and that's very true
And this ain't another cover
This is to uncover all the magic
That is happening this summer
And girl, you'll always be my lover
But then a time will come where you'll
Go and find another
But you'll always be my star
(Girl, you'll always be my star)

Man, I remember
(No matter where you are)
(Trust me, you'll always be my star)
Back in...I don't even remember...how old I was
(You'll always be my star)
(Trust me, you'll always be my star)

But.. I might have been like 8 when I had my first girlfriend
I guess we've been messing up ever since
I don't do it on purpose so...
I guess... I don't know if it's me.. or, what

I want somebody
That can touch my body
Who's loving everybody
But is loving nobody but me
And nobody can see
What me and her are doing on our spare time
Cause that's our time
It isn't their time

And I'm just sad because it's over
And I'm not the one to look over my shoulder
Keep on moving forward
If I'm looking back I'm gonna try
And she told me that I'm really just a selfish kind of guy
Well I guess she knows me best
But it didn't feel like it when her hands was on my chest
I guess that Costa Rica and Philly was very selfish of me
Well I'm sorry girl, I'm just silly and I feel hopeless if that's true
Because you know that I'm feeling so very lonely when you're gone and we were chilling until we... broke up

Know what?
You was there when I woke up
Got emotions that we can soak up
Girl, I can be your soldier
Girl I promise that
And I'll never take that promise back
If it wasn’t for you I would just kinda rap
Prince Charming may come one day
And girl I'm fine with that'
But you'll always be my star
(You'll always be my star)
(You'll always be my star)
Girl, no matter where you are
(Trust me, you'll always be my star)
Girl you'll always be my star
You know that
You'll always be my...
Girl you'll always be my star

Cause this room is really starry
This is me telling every girl I've dated, that I'm sorry
Yea it's really starry
This is me telling every girl I've dated, that I'm sorry
Sof, girl I'm sorry
Cause This is me telling every girl I've dated, that I'm sorry
Kennedy, I'm sorry
This is me telling all them other girls that I'm just sorry cause
Man, this room is really starry
And I'm sorry
Girl, you know I'm sorry
This room is really starry
Rachel, girl I'm sorry
Man, this room is just so starry
And it's time I should say sorry
But it's bright outside
Girl, in here it's really starry
Olivia I'm sorry but this room is so... starry
Girl, I'm sorry
But this room is really starry

Stella...
Girl, I'm sorry



[Verse: Jaden Smith]
Yeah
This what Daniel sends me when he meditates
A wizard's always early, man I'm never late
I like rainbows, wear the same clothes
Man you chill with Momo man I set em straight
I always excavate, yeah
I'm in the escalade
Follow me up on my escapades, yeah
So tribal, flow is so vital
Talk to God on my own, bro, with no Bible
This beat fat, no lipo
What you got the knife for?
Cuz I'm psycho
What you think I try to spend the night for?
Playing Tycho with my eyes closed
Walkin tightrope
I'm just tryna spit some lyrics that are more insightful
But you just called me bipo (I'm not)
And yeah that stands for bipolar
I'm thinking bout some solar panels but just wait til' I'm older homie
You know I handle it and you can screw a diploma homie
You stop learning when you graduate
I'mma be 40 doing magic tryna activate my merkaba
And now I'm thinking bro I'm glad you hate
Cuz you ain't got no passion
Stop and listen to this passionate
Verse
Meanwhile Kylie's still sipping that Aspartame
Bro, I didn't ask for fame
I'm tryna pass my classic name
I don't really care about the cash and bro you fashion hate
The MSFTS are the future be ambassadors of acting great

[Outro: Daniel D'artiste]
Damn J
That sounded like a... a inter-dimensional tesseract man
Thats's kinda crazy dude
Oh man MSFTS is..
Sounds like a... proton particle or something
I don't even know



[Hook: Jaden Smith, ¿Téo?]
I've got the... I got the jewels and the diamonds
When I open my eyes I can never find them
Skating, sunset and hiding
Got the metal in my mouth, what you think I'm biting
Ladies love it when I sing
Tryna find out what I'm in

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna get you on the floor
You love me girl, I love you more
Last night I just wasn't sure
I'm tryna get you to the court

[Pre-hook: Jaden Smith, ¿Téo?]
I've been there...
I've been there before
Take your legs
And put them around my...

[Hook 2]
I've got the... I got the jewels and the diamonds
But when I open my eyes I can never find them
Got me running from the sirens
I just woke up on Sunset, and Highland

[Verse 2]
MSFTS are styling (style!, style!)
We know you gotta stylist, joker why you lying
I ain't really with violence
Probably see me at Tyga's house playing violins
Cause money really ain't a thing
All these diamonds and these rings
I should really make a sword
Tryna tell you I'm the guy
Bought a whip, it's in Dubai
Didn't worry from a soul
Rapping like a turtle
I got all these federal reserves notes
Oh, jumping over hurdles
Dont forget a rap a verse
Around you like a circle

[Bridge]
But thats on the day to day
Baby I had a good day today
Send a fuck nigga away, away
Hit a sexy momma with a ¿cómo está?
She come straight from Bogotá
She got the Kamehameha

[Hook]
I've got the... I got the jewels and the diamonds
When I open my eyes I can never find them
Skating, Sunset and Highland
Got the metal in my mouth, what you think I'm biting

[Outro: ¿Téo?]
Yeah!



[Intro]
"This ain't Disney Land, this is the Bronx!
Either you be strong or you be gone!"

[Verse]
Wanna see some rubbish?
I'm undercover at train yards and lovin' it
I'm tryna think what lady paint the covenant
To find a wall to bomb, the whole Bronx is crumblin'
We should do it on Charlotte just for the fun of it
And the name is Rumi if you was wonderin'
Alien in a top hat, I'm hoverin'
And I'm chillin' with Mylene
We guzzlin' holy water, it's hotter than hell
Don't let the summer in
Man you lookin' at me like you impressed now
B-boy steez with the fresh style
Shaolin Fantastic's on the disc, and you like
"What's this kid?" Welcome to the Get Down
Hope you're ready to get down
Shaolin Fantastic's on the disc, and you like
"What's this kid?" Welcome to the Get Down
(Welcome to the Get Down...)



[Pre-Hook]
And tell me what's your soulection, and what's your direction, shout out to Joekay
And tell me what's your soulection, and tell me what's your soul...

[Verse]
Check it
Heart broke Joe wrote a letter to parole officers in Colorado
Said he dropped the damn bottle
In the Tahoe, on the way to Lake Tahoe
With some fine models keep in mind we sleep sepearate
Cross around my neck
Man the freaking priest left it at the precinct, after he told me he beat tetris
You're freaking joking
I told that joker keep stepping and he did but he left behind his Louis V pendant
The youth is stressing
And we need some independence
From the deep end of the pool and press clean sentence, for real
Ain't no actors here we only activist
Grab some MSFT and give em care packages screw a platinum disk
This is music and it's coming from the soul
Screw the super bowl numbers in the gold with the Rolls Royce Ghost
Cause before you know we all gone be some ghost
But right now you got your voice
So listen to the young boy spit pois, no intermission
Taking nothing, turn it to something magician in the room
I see you fishing for something given use some worth
Take your ideas and put it on a shirt
And you'll fall real hard and trust me it'll hurt
But you'll learn how to surf the rhythm of the earth
And you've been here for a minute
I'm giving you your birth so you know what your purpose is...

[Hook]
And tell me what's your soulection
And tell me what's your soulection
And tell me what's your direction
And tell me what's your aye
Tell me... And baby what's your soulection
And baby what's your soulection
And baby what's your direction
Aye, aye shout out to Joekay



[Intro]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

[Hook]
Aye girl how you livin tonight?
Can I get forgiven tonight?
Cause the way that it’s lookin like I’m sinning tonight
Cause I’m lookin and I see a lot of women tonight
They'll probably try and blow me off
So they'll stunt about my swag(?) so they know I’m bossing
You know a joker got to ball
They say how’d you get it back, cause I never lost it
You know a joker stay afloat
They like my music they don’t every really play it though
Is it just cause I’m a minor?
And I’m ticking like a timer, and all my ladies finer than your women?
All my clothes designer and I’m hotter than an iron
And the irony’s I'm tired and I’m winnin
And I’m grinning
Maybach, yeah I’m in it
Girl why you trippin? Take a minute
Oh, geez
Girl I’m kidding
Take you to my spot, I can show you how I’m livin
Get up in my car but only if you’re with it
We’d be kissin’ in the back cuz my windows stay tinted
I just did it to 'em
No girl, I’m not timid
You can hit the mall my car, don’t got a limit
Even if it you did, lil joker didn't hit it
Cuz you keep on going higher ever since I started spitting
Girl you sad, I get it
Girl you mad, what is it?
Something bad? I'll fix it
But all you want is swag
Well, I’m glad that you admit it
Cause these jokers tripping

[Hook]
Bruh this is my town
Teo in the spot when the joker ain’t around
Pat me on the head, just be careful of the crown
And my dad said that you still lost 'til you found
And you keep theem going down

Sometimes life is hard, don’t let love get you down
Don’t do it girl, don’t do it
You’re so beautiful but baby, who knew it?

Sometimes life is hard, don’t let love get you down
I admit it, I get pissed when you trippin
We either break-up or make up so forget it

[Verse 2]
Girl you walked up in the night club
Well, you walked up in the right club
And some dudes tryna get something
Well, it’s bout to be a fight club
Cause I been lookin for a hottie with a body
Girl you got me Thinking
Girl I got you drinking
Lemonade stay pink, and we can sneak in
My room for the weekend
Tell that chef that you a vegan
Baby you ain’t never leaving
Kiss you want a cheek when you sleepin
Beacon of light
Baby girl, good night
I know that you on my sight
But that’s only for the night
Why it always gotta feel wrong when it’s right?
It’s about to go down and you know it
Girl I really like it so just throw it down
Girl while I'm off bein' a poet
You 'gon be at home trying to hold it down
When you get mad girl I know it
That’s when you take your phone and you throw it down
I’m looking at you now and you going
And I looks up in my eyes and you know it
And I hold it but it’s bout to go down

[Bridge]
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down down down..

[Hook]



I am the last one intelligence
The swag comes with elegance
That was blessed upon you
But that's what just you learn from these debts and fondu
I'll handle the bill, but the rest is on you
Jaden is the true, yes I'm on to the next ish
MSFTS, we're so reckless
I'm on a stage, care less what the set list is
Is because you didn't put me on it
And I'mma diss you when you try to put me on it
Said I used to be so sweet, put a cookie on it Jaden
Stop playing games, I'm just playing hockey honest
But I just wanna be snug tight with the girl of my dreams
And continue this love life cause
It took a lot of pain to get here
When this gonna be gone by this time next year
But know the game is a good school
Man, I ain't got no problem, but I'mma be on tour with my..
Sad cause I used to be the bad
And you used to be myâ€¦girl version
And my world is turning upside down
Everybody shut up right now
Somebody pull me up right now
Cause I'm swimming in my sorrows and I just might drown, girl
And my past is graphic, you make my heart sore like some lactic acid
All my friends tell me I'm the best
I don't believe them, but I'm going to the top
And you know that I will never leave them that's the crew there
And I'mma talk about root beer in my songs if I want to
Cos we're at the top Marley, are you here?
No Cause we don't want you here
Chilling with your friends
I haven't seen you in two years
Have fun with Kennedy when you kick it
Before she goes away and doesn't ask me to visit
Have a problem visit
Girl, I'm not gonna see you
But it's really not gonna be different from the past year
Everyone says I'm changing
Gone to my head, I haven't even been famous
Karate Kid is behind this
Diamonds on my neck is a simple reminder of
All the shots and all the set offs and all the tears I cried so I can get my leg up
And I came back and the joker got his bread up
And walked around town young man with his head up!
Had to make it rain in the storm, didn't let up
Until my movies went out of the theaters
And all you can just forget us
Now Willow is a star man how weak is that?
Pink hair, long socks can't compete with us!

I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes
I do what I wanna do, where I wanna do it
Hand me the scissors I cut threw it
I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes
I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes, I'm Gonzoes
I do what I wanna do, where I wanna do it
You stop me now, I run through it

Uh, pulling off full throttle
All my other haters I'll stuff you down in the bottle
I made that, all you jokers rocking..
Your girl is fine, my girl look like she a modell
Uh, more artistic than Picasso
Unless the joke is up, I'm looking likeâ€¦
My flow is tight, your flow is just not so
Sorry if I'm coming up from being hostile Gonzoes



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Pythagorean Theorem, yo Cleopatra be the queen of my harem
Huh, Plato and Socrates talk to me luckily no one can hear em
Yeah, you just repeat on the beat like a parrot, I be so embarrassed
Huh, top of Mount Olympus no one is near him but we really need you to move, damn
What the fuck you finna' do man
Triple three, is that the crew? yeah
All my niggas lookin' smooth, ay
See me swimmin' in a suit, ye
Cut that nigga head, yeah he toupee
Now I'm bout to make a movie
With a grown one, cutie
We should roll one loosely
Need some water like Bruce Lee
She my Sugarfish sushi
I should prolly get some new sheets
Need a Tesla with the new seats
Then I'm gone like poofy
Prolly wearin' fake jewelry
All you niggas so boring
Don't call me I'm touring
Ex girl so corny
Call ¿Teo? we need more fees
Got me strung up off the Morphine
New nigga I'm morphing
More glasses need more *click*
Lose the jokers with the tour tees
You know who your fashion source sees
Bad one, speakin' Portuguese
Wait til she divorces me
Screw your Staples Center floor seats
We just need a billion paying jobs and some more peace
I'm duckin' these people, I'm flippin' up like I'm Evel Knievel
I look at my watch, ain't no time for no freeloaders
My clip was empty, I'm back and I'm reloaded
Yeah, 60 from 0, couple seconds I'm a neighborhood hero
Yeah, I want that dinero, I hop in that taxi like Robert De Niro
Yeah, they wanted the movement, I made it a movement, I made the apparel
Yeah, these children are empty they fallin' in sorrow
Your lyrics are sterile, I told you
"Yo where'd you get that?"
I'm not gonna hold you, got it at Whole Foods
"Ay why you leavin'?", "Where did you go?", "I just gotta know you"



Swag, Swag, Swag, Swag

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Girl, you can be my Superboo
And you looking stupid cool
In that dress that you wore with the Hightops
I'm clean pressed cause I rolled in the Maybach
But, maybe we should skate sometime
Or go up on a date sometime
Cause whatever you want, we can shop for
Now at the bottom, we can go up to the top floor
New York City, we just chillin' on the top floor
Gold iPhone and I'm hoping that you got yours
Cause baby you're my precious
Led you on a surf, we can go and get some lessons
Take you to Hawaii
Call villain get some sessions in
That's the clique no question
Don't do well with first impressions
I'm the freshest
I open up like all your presents
Girl, this is the life
So just come enjoy this essence
Equals dresses in your bag

[Hook: Josiah Bell]

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky
We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]

As I'm lookin' through a peephole
Girl I'm like a movie and I'm waitin' for my sequel
And it's you
And please don't listen to these other people
Cause all they do is hate
But they say that love is evil (and it's true)
And you not one of them girls that I see up at the school
You the girl at the party wearin' see-through in the pool
And I like you livin' life up on the edge
Feet hangin'
And I'd like to see some life up in this bed
If you aimin' all those shorts that you be wearin'
They be scarin' me
It's feelin' like you 'em and you tear 'em
But apparently these jokers just don't care
And ev'rybody there was starin', G
You just kept on laughin'
Livin' life like it's a parody
But I'm 'bout to kill 'em
Give it to 'em all
Rockin' shorts in the summer, rockin' denim in the fall
And I'mma roll up with my friends in the Benz when you call
Cause we chillin' in the Beamer, but the fans wanna ball
MSFTS... Rep

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]

This love is like a fairytale;
It's very well written
Soft lips
Scary thrill if I'll ever be forgiven this
Fresh love...
This fresh love is the best love
The type of love
Where you can't even imagine your next love if there is one
Wisdom is something we lack at this age
It's all fun and games till the kids come, haha
But baby, what's your wish?
Ever since our first kiss, my mom's been dreamin' of fish
We're together now
And I don't care who you been with
This love isn't a myth
So come and chase the sun and in my heart you'll always live
And just know I'll always tell you what it is

[Hook]

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky
We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes...

MSFTS



[Verse]
I don't wanna cry
I just want to get you out of my mind
Open your eyes
I been by your side through all of this time
Excuse the disguise
For all the magic that is hitting my mind
We're living a lie
Open your eyes
I been by your side through all of this time
Through all of them guys
Through all of them lies

[Outro]
Ooh, help us
Something is new
Tell us
Talking to you
Selfish
I do not want to die



[Verse 1]
All I need is a misfitee
You should probly bounce if you hatin on me
If you're not with the clique you should probly leave
I don't care, I got a camera cause I'm not saying cheese, please
My flows are so disgusting
I don't care I'm mean muggging
Cause you know they letting us in
Cause we making some adjustments, we are the top now
Man all I do is laugh
I don't pay attention
You will never see me in detention
Homie not to mention I don't go to school m but you could always see me in the session
Cause I'm spittin the poison
In the studio when I'm letting my boys in
You could come kick it but you're leaving your boyfriend
And please shut the door cause you're letting the noise in
Now shut em up

Cause I need you here
I can't see tomorrow
Cause I need you here
I can't see tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Nobody can help us, stay rebellious
MSFTS slick as Elvis
Man I'm ready to mingle
Talkin to your girl as you're playing my single
It ain't a jingle what has been changed
And the funny thing is I don't say her name
I say the clique
It's just a part of my artistry
Giving all these stupid jokers lobotomies honestly
MSFTS, we the ones who started it
And I kinda put my heart in it
I wanna skate yea, we should go and fold a bit
And now all the yellow part of it
Shell fly that I got a girl shakin
Nice whip, went to Malibu skating
It's a movement, nobody can make me do anything, it's history in the making though

Cause I need you here
I can't see tomorrow
Cause I need you here
I can't see tomorrow

[Verse 3]
I just put my track on
Camo slacks on
My name is Jaden, you can't hate it if I made it
Look I made it, take a look around
I'm Caesar sittin in in my palace
Take a look around
Many here, I even got a callous
MSFTS my brothers
If you disagree then go up in the gutter
Dressed so fly, so smooth like butter
Homie dude that stutter
No, tell your shit to shut uo
Many circumscrate rap shit
I'm a die in a MSFTS casket
When you real like classic
My whip just got called the Jurassic, magic

[Intro: Together]
[?] says Palace brothers and sisters live forever, bless them

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
We should go to Disney
And we should go to Disney
Ride rides until we're dizzy
Eat way too many churros
There's way too many zeros

[Verse 1: Willow Smith]
And you got me looking, got me looking
I remember first day we were talking
I told you I had a secret, that I would not tell it
You still don't know
But I can walk down the street like my mind don't know
And I can talk to these people like they might not know
But I'm always floating in the clouds
I'm always speaking with the angels, speaking with the E.T's
Extraterrestrials, extra more vegetables, eat, eat your vegetables

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
Baby we should fall in love
For only three days, for only three days
Baby we should fall in love
For only three days (only three days)
Oh we should fall in love
For only three days, for only three days
Baby we should go to Disney
Ride rides until we're dizzy
Baby we should fall in love
For only three days, for only three days
I could tell you three ways, I could tell you three ways

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
There's a couple of our show books on the floor
Pillars of consciousness is opened to page six
And Channel Orange is playing just [?] for us to make conversation
There are crystals in the triangle in front of me
I'm sitting on the floor with my legs crossed and you're sitting on the bed
You're reading Being in Love, love, love
It's like 92 degrees outside
There are white Christmas lights wrapped around two shelves next to the TV in the living room
The Christmas lights are on and the AC is off
Hot box
Ummm...divide that by nine please



[Verse 1]
It’s the lucridis stupid kids bout to raise the roof again
They let us in the booth again
It’s the stained socks and drop crotch
Get out of the clique if you’re not hot cuz I got that cootie illness
Tell me if you feel this
Even though we’ll soon know we the realest
Cuz we run this
See me up in Cali, see me up in London
A penny bought and I’m skating in style cuz I’m still rocking my Jordans (duh)
Louie V, we can’t afford it
But I’m still rocking MSFTS cuz all of that stuff is boring
I rep MSFTS to the death of me
J Woods to my right of me
Isaac to the left of me
All these rules, sorry they ain’t getting me
I’mma skate forever and these jokers never bother me

[Hook]
I just wanna cruise with my dudes
We ain’t got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes doing kickflips
I just wanna cruise with my dudes
We ain’t got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes doing kickflips

[Verse 2]
I don’t care about the rules
Barely in school and the chef isn’t cool
But I ain’t got a problem in the world
Cuz I got my top down and I’m ridin with my girl and
Now that uh.. I’m just living life
I am not a true
I’m just tryin to live cool
We the freshest
Dip up in the pool cuz it’s cool and refreshin
Shouts getters to my freshmans
And my flow is hotter than the clothes that you dressed in
Girl i’m chillin with my best friends
We could call yours, we could knock up on some doors
Take you to some stores, talk about all of our tours
And we chillin for the night so ladies we all yours
We just livin to the fullest
But soon as we go broke you be dodging us like bullets

[Hook]
I just wanna cruise with my dudes
We ain’t got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes doing kickflips
I just wanna cruise with my dudes
We ain’t got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes doing kickflips

[Verse 3]
Let the track breathe for a second
Got some nice bars, you should check em'
MSFTS life if you with it
But if you’re not then just forget it
My windows stay tinted
Dippin from the paparazzi
You don’t understand if you’re not me
They got me
Jockin from the photos
You already know though
Well little joker keep it on the low low
So stay out of our business
Or tag along is you with this
Cuz I could spit this
And you should chill cuz you’re messin with the MSFTS

[Hook]
I just wanna cruise with my dudes
We ain’t got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes doing kickflips
I just wanna cruise with my dudes
We ain’t got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes doing kickflips



[Produced by AzZi]

We should hit the beach
With this dang effect on my voice
Man you probably think a joker can't speak
Into your blouse Imma reach
'Til we hit our peak
Talk about the album so much that it's kinda like it leaked
Damn that Jaden's a beast, like Grand Theft Auto with cheats
Then again you thought I was weak
Wear my heart on my sleeve so I get your daughters in sheets
Not the hardest MC but the only artist you see
Let's go to the beach, man let's roll in the streets
It's the coldest in the winter, only soldiers you see
A bunch of circles over here so you know that it's me
You wanna cry? Girl my shoulder is free

Let's get older and see
(Let me help you with your problems)
Let's get older and see
(I could probably show a thing or two)

Yeah let's get older and see the stars and the skies
The sun on horizon
Then look in my eyes
Don't worry 'bout what they're advertisin'
I keep you surprised cause you know I live all these lives
In different bodies, don't worry 'bout what joker's got ties in
You know the story of Poseidon?
Who do you think'll bring the tide in?
Who do you think'll make the waves wash up on the ground
While the joker's steady ridin' on my poetry
I tried to fight it but I'm glad I tried it
Keep that, no need to hide it, man I'm too excited
4th dimension, 3rd dimension, man I'm undecided
I ate all my enemies so now I got the itis
[?] when my path comes, I hope you light it
Emerald Tablets



[Hook: Jaden Smith]
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
Don't you wish you'd just be happy?
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Girl I know you had a bad day
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
I wish that you could just be happy
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
You're staying [?]
I'll be your man, you stay tonight
But girl you had a bad day
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
You say you wish you could be happy
But that ain't cool, sad loves you too

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
And I stare at the moon and I'm barely cool
And I just had a dream that I'd go to Paris with you
And yeah my therapy's through
A picture of me conflicting with freaky sheriffs in school
Embarrassing freaking kids but I cherish you
Apparently I couldn't fall in love with a parachute
I wish I was there for you, really girl I feel terrible
And I wrote a parable for you to burn up and tear, you know
We're living through it, all the pain is unbearable

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
Don't you wish you could be happy?
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be okay
Girl I know you had a bad day
I can see it in your face
I know you wishing that you were still happy
I can see it in your texts girl
I can read it in your tweets girl
I can feel it in the streets girl
I'm just tryna bridge the peace

[Verse 2: dylAn]
Oh you had a bad day
Cause I had it my way
Should I reply babe
Not my babe but I know you behind me
Going into this blindly
Cause I can't see
Talking philanthropy
Up on the canapy
You cannot stand me
You not understanding me
Understand, I'm your man
If I put my compass inside your hand
Would you [?] it out
Would you drill it out
I don't know what the nails about
But I got the hand when you got the blame
You are not correcting my perfect grammar
Got my brother next to me
He playing the guitars like he's Dan Kanter

[Hook: Jaden Smith]
Have you ever had a bad day?
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
Don't you wish you'd just be happy?
That ain't okay, sad loves you too
Girl I know you had a bad day
You'll be okay, you'll be alright
I wish that you could just be happy
That ain't okay, sad loves you too



[Intro: Lido]
[?]

[Interlude: Halsey]
(Wait for me in the back... And I mean it
Grab the stupid microphone, I meant everything I said Everything)

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
**** just hit me on the phone
I gotta take the call or Alabama shake you off
I made your favorite playlist in my basement, dog
Take away the a-list man, let's play some ball like soccer
Kicking it with Harry like Chewbacca, man, I gotcha
Never been a rasta but I always keep the essense
Teachers couldn't test these little jokers adolescence
Here’s a lesson for the kid that’s living life way too aggressive
You could be professors you just need to switch professions
Wanna do what's right but homie look the way they left him
Let's switch directions
We need to open up our spectrum
So when my set come you see the way my flows infect them
And they inspire them
Teachers politics they tire them
You see them tires man?
Drilling oil out the ground swear we need to fire them
All these homeless people around you know we could hire them
But we choose not to
Gentrification when the Blacks move and the cops do too
I'm coming with you if you got a problem here's a noose
A tissue and a lucid pistol
That we snuck across the border illegally
So society could be in order

[Interlude: Jaden Smith]
But when you need me I'm gone
Girl I'm gone
And I'm sorry 'bout your son that I murdered in the street
And not this fresh verse or this jazzy ass beat gonna help you
Cause he's gone
Damn he's really gone
Shit what's going on?

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
But we can make it girl
Even if you need me to strip naked in Times Square
Just so we can take it there
The key to this is patience girl
The lotus grows up from the mud
Like four quarts of the blood
From a virgin who's never heard the word “love” come from
A person who felt that feeling it turns out
That the worlds a circus, it isn't perfect
I've heard of
Stories of a surgeon who cut someone and there's no heart in him
Did you steal it?
Can you feel it
Wrote my feelings on the ceiling
Man i swear it's so revealing
That the lotus flower grows up from the mud
Every time you bathe you put four hearts in a tub
Then you squash them
Then you blend them up
Drink them all for breakfast, you a monster
And your friends are gone
Depression is infectious and it's awesome
You’re so crazy busy you ain’t noticed that you lost him
But when you're feeling low you grab some diamonds from your closet
You're superficial
Man you look into the world but girl the truth is simple
Let me give you some info
Take off your damn make-up
Cause I don’t give a fuck about a stupid pimple
Or this damn tempo, I'ma loose my mental
I went to bat for you
I produced your whole album
Every chord had your attitude and attributes
This is me getting back at you
But you did what you had to do
Fuck you girl you were magical
And let it run deep

[Outro: Lido]
[?]



[Intro]
Dilla came back to this planet through Daniel (x3)
Laid this beat down, then went back to the astral
Then played this on piano add a little more keys
As the frequencies grow, instruments get more compatible

[Verse]
Catapult
Inside the ground little caterpillars, has to grow
Turn to in a butterfly, flying like a radical
Playing in the sky, higher than a damn magical
One dragon he was laughing at me
But then I had to go
(Yo, Ah)
You a pretty thing
Maybe wait a couple years, you want a pretty ring
Isn’t that right?
Can I make you more conscious?
Can I get up in your conscience?
You tell your friends I’m obnoxious
Aw, look all those pretty boys talk slick
Girls say those pretty boys talk slick
[1, 2, 3, and 4]
I got you there baby girl this love is toxic
I’m on the top floor and not a single plan is stopping
Nah baby girl we get it popping (us)
Time to land we in the cockpit
Ay we in the LA, we in Chicago
Ay we in the town, we in Miami now
Ay me and Danny probably headed for the Grammy now
We stunting boy you with some hand-me downs
Ya
And my freak loads girls give me the besitos
Make it to London, Heathrow
Missing all of my free throws
She did cheat codes[?]
Making movies with zero sequels
Hanging out with the weirdest people
Me and you look like we belong, bæ were amigos
A seguir me poquito[?]
You couldn’t faze me see the future and day dream
Several doses of raging[?]
See me on the screen, they scream you can’t replace me
Eating lobster is tasty, man you can’t even taste me
Jokers think that they are fresh, your verses are toothpastey
I’m too hasty
Edger Casey
Still under 18
Hella spacey
Obviously you be seeing different stuff than they see
Your teacher hates me
Man your parents want to make me
Damn what goodness sakes B we’re the A-team
Hate the way we say things
But we make dreams, come true
And escape clean and they’re hating
(Yeah, ah)
But so would I, if I was them
Because when you leader of tower, every coward is you friend
(Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Do things
Computers can't say things



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Aye girl how you livin tonight?
Can I get forgiven tonight?
Cause the way that it’s lookin like I’m sinning tonight
Cause I’m lookin and I see a lot of women tonight
They'll probably try and blow me off
So they'll stunt about my swag so they know I’m bossing
You know a joker gotta ball
They say how’d you get it back, cause I never lost it
You know a joker stay afloat
They like my music they don’t every really play it though
Is it just cause I’m a minor?
And I’m ticking like a timer, and all my ladies finer than your women?
All my clothes designer and I’m hotter than an iron
And the irony’s I'm tired and I’m winnin
And I’m grinning
Maybach, yeah I’m in it
Girl why you trippin? Take a minute
Oh, geez
Girl I’m kidding
Take you to my spot, I can show you how I’m livin
Get up in my car but only if you’re with it
We’d be kissin’ in the back cuz my windows stay tinted
I just did it to 'em
No girl, I’m not timid
You can hit the mall my car, don’t got a limit
Even if it you did, lil joker didn't hit it
Cuz you keep on going higher ever since I started spitting
Girl you sad, I get it
Girl you mad, what is it?
Something bad? I'll fix it
But all you want is swag
Well, I’m glad that you admit it
Cause these jokers tripping

[Hook: Jaden Smith & T. Coles]
Bruh this is my town
Teo in the spot when the joker ain’t around
Pat me on the head, just be careful of the crown
And my dad said that you still lost 'til you found
And you keep theem going down

Sometimes life is hard, don’t let love get you down(down, down)
Don’t do it girl, don’t do it
You’re so beautiful but baby, who knew it?

Sometimes life is hard, don’t let love get you down (down, down)
I admit it, I get pissed when you trippin
We either break-up or make up so forget it

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Girl you walked up in the night club
Well, you walked up in the right club
And some dudes tryna get something
Well, it’s bout to be a fight club
Cause I been lookin for a hottie with a body
Girl you got me Thinking
Girl I got you drinking
Lemonade stay pink, and we can sneak in
My room for the weekend
Tell that chef that you a vegan
Baby you ain’t never leaving
Kiss you want a cheek when you sleepin
Beacon of light
Baby girl, good night
I know that you on my sight
But that’s only for the night
Why it always gotta feel wrong when it’s right?
It’s about to go down and you know it
Girl I really like it so just slow it down
Girl while I'm off bein' a poet,(down)
You 'gon be at home trying to hold it down
When you get mad girl I know it(down)
That’s when you take your phone and you throw it down
I’m looking at you now and you going(down)
And I looks up in my eyes and you know it(down)
And I hold it but it’s bout to go down

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down
It’s about to go down down down..

[Hook: Jaden Smith & T. Coles]
Bruh this is my town

Don’t do it girl, don’t do it

Boy I need a gold crown
Boy I need a gold crown

[Verse 1]
Come groove with the coolest kids in school
Make them other dudes look foolish
Watch me while I do this
I don’t care what the mood is
Baby girl we should rock and roll
Send some kids to the hospital
I mean we gots to go
When I lead it’s impossible
Want some games? Yea I got some more
A little dance won’t hurt you
Play tracks til the curfew
Girl touch upon my curls and they tuck em on my virtue
Me and you should be the first to
Let’s take it with me
Girl I really wanna kiss you
Cuz I’m really gonna miss you
Said this dude
In a way don’t worry cuz my eyes are getting blurry
Baby girl so..


[Hook]
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharaohs. God. Golden
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharaohs. God. Kings and queens


[Verse 2]
Let’s screw to the evening
Baby sooner to believe in Bob and Evan
Do the crowd cuz they all screaming loud
But girl and I leaving
I don’t even got a reason
To step away from your beauty cuz you’re looking like a movie
Take my hand if you’re really feeling groovy
You could leave now if you knew me but you don’t so..
Let’s take you vanish
Wash away my hands and don’t roll the cameras
I like my campus, watch where my fans is
Let’s play the jams and we start the dancing
Chill backstreet relaxing
And off the dorm right now, that’s my passion
On the moon, moonwalking like Jackson
And I see you, just you doing my glasses


[Hook]
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharaohs. God. Golden
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharaohs. God. Kings and queens


[Verse 3]

[Hook]
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharaohs. God. Golden
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharaohs. God. Kings and queens



[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Saying that we're on our way
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We've travelled too far from home

[Bridge: Jaden Smith]
Stay and I will run away
I really doubt that we'll go
I hope the sunset will stay
We've travelled too far home

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Saying that we're on our way
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We've travelled too far from home

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna know
You can be my bride



[Verse:]
I don't usually get turnt but I'm feeling like a door knob
When that bus rollin' Lil' joker I'm a tour guide
Chillin in Dubai, and I'm feeling like I'm poor boy
Whether you know or not, Lil' joker can't afford that, woah

Bout to drop an album, that's a short shot
See that body roll, Lil' Mami I want more of that
Hit me on the phone with your problems, I been knowing that
You spraying chem trails in the sky that I be soaring at
I told you's

I'm hot as water when it boils
I rub yo body with the oils (yeah)
I wrap the crystals with the coils, man we got the pure silver
I ain't messing with the foils, I don't know you's
And that's the issue, tell security to look at your credentials
Before you blow up like a missile. Let's keep it simple
Saying, "Jaden, man, I want to know the info"
But you don't know what you're in fo', I'm being mintal
All white, you can call it clean dental and I got a nice girl with a movie and a dimple, and my doctor tried to tell that it's mental
I love you's



I be sittin' back in my palace
Watchin Alice, eatin salads
With sexy ladies in Balance (Ballads?)
Sippin orange juice out my chalice
Satisfying, my pally
My rhymes tough as a callous, cause
My writtens bout as dark as my tennies
I'm winnin until the finish
They say I'm sick as a clinic
Get your head out my business
I keep it clean as a dentist
And have your fun at the beach
Cause we taking this up to Venice
Misfits, and we in this
Keep it and then critique it
You leak it, then Imma freak it
You say I'm the ish, I'm reeking
Follow you every weekend
Still seeking for someone decent
Like, we were supposed to be meetin'
But then I found out you vegan
Like, woah! Baby girl
You gotta be movin' fast
You can't be my first
Baby girl but you can be my last
And it kinda hurts
When I see you, Imma need some glasses
And I love you cause you does you
But that love the class (?) girl
I'm on the dash
We sittin here in the fest
Says I kiss you on the neck
Like what are we doing next?
And my dawgs on they decks
Gettin checks
Man we feeling blessed
High up in them jets
That's a yes
And we rep the west
Msfts on our chest
Dressed too good to impress
Yes we do it best
And we never give them nothing less

Cause you do it, what we does
And we do it on the home, and we going off the dome
Cause I'm wreckless, I'll wreck this
I'm on that set list
Don't guess I'm the best cause you should just expect it
At a festival, cause I'm festive
Girls say I'm restless
My clique, you don't mess with
I spit bars, so check this
I'm walkin' in, bingo
My team go, in that gringo
Mingle, cause I'm single
Come catch on to our lingo
Like, "Joka, what's goooooood!"
Misfits in my hood
Beat my clique, I wish you all could
Cause I got a fine girl named Dominique
Cool take for that nominee
In the club, it's no crime for me
So when the cops come, It's no time to see
I'm so sick
People tell me I'm slick
So I just beat you all in my rhymes
Then Imma give a break to my fists
Man, that's my clique!

We could stop, we could start again

[Pre-Hook]
And tell me what's your soulection, and what's your direction, shout out to Jokay
And tell me what's your soulection, and tell me what's your soul...

[Verse]
Check it
Heart broke Joe wrote a letter to parole officers in Colorado
Said he dropped the damn bottle
In the Tahoe, on the way to Lake Tahoe
With some fine models keep in mind we sleep sepearate
Cross around my neck
Man the freaking priest left it at the precinct, after he told me he beat tetris
You're freaking joking
I told that joker keep stepping and he did but he left behind his Louis V pendant
The youth is stressing
And we need some independence
From the deep end of the pool and press clean sentence, for real
Ain't no actors here we only activist
Grab some MSFT and give em care packages screw a platinum disk
This is music and it's coming from the soul
Screw the super bowl numbers in the gold with the Rolls Royce Ghost
Cause before you know we all gone be some ghost
But right now you got your voice
So listen to the young boy spit pois, no intermission
Taking nothing, turn it to something magician in the room
I see you fishing for something given use some worth
Take your ideas and put it on a shirt
And you'll fall real hard and trust me it'll hurt
But you'll learn how to surf the rhythm of the earth
And you've been here for a minute
I'm giving you your birth so you know what your purpose is...

[Hook]
And tell me what's your soulection
And tell me what's your soulection
And tell me what's your direction
And tell me what's your aye
Tell me... And baby what's your soulection
And baby what's your soulection
And baby what's your direction
Aye, aye shout out to Joekay



[Intro]
Yup!

[Verse]
Why you drive so fast? Why you drive so fast?
Girl where you gotta go? Girl where you gotta go?
Baby you should try and drive slow
You should try and drive slow
Cause you're going 45 on the 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up to drive all the kids scream
I don't know baby girl you're movin' onto better things
Usually you don't be using me
I'm dead you cry at my eulogy
Magic like Houdini
Baby you taking my scrutiny out with the fireworks
This isn't new to me
Damn baby jump off the roof with me
Live up your youth with me
Before they shootin' me
With all their cameras and bullets
I swear I'm the man up in France with the hooligans
Yeah, I'm up with Centipede, you do not answer me
I'm in the canopy, livin' my life like a fantasy
Sleep with the girl of my dreams on the weeks
So I sleep and I see my reality
Battle me, that's your fatality
Actually, I'm a catastrophe
Go to your school and they ask for me
I'm in your class making cash
And we're fruity like passion
It's burning like ashes
We had to just make this ish happen
He's rappin' again, he's snappin' again
It happened my friends
I'm back with the Benz
And I know you jokers stay pissed
So I had to make you pre-exist
