Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is so real
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll
How you do it? Only God know
I want to know who's real until the time fold
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'mma stay down with the same niggas I came up with that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12

Hello? Hello?.

Want you there every morning to tie my ties
Because being with you is like being on a wild roller coaster ride
How many nights can I go without seeing your pretty face
We could do it anywhere, you pick the time and the place
You’re my little freak, I always want you in my space
Every moment I spend with you, there's nothing I'd erase

I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always about you

But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young

But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better

Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on

I had a hard, hard life, ayy
It's been that way all my life, ayy
I had to earn my stripes, ayy
Had to pay my part, ayy
I know what you're goin' through, ayy
You just want someone to love you, ayy
Feel like there's no one on your team
Had to hit the block when I was 14, ayy
Ayy, since I was a young nigga, I knew what I wanted to be
Like Martin I had a dream, like Martin I had a dream
Watch out for 12, might have to move the trap, heard it's a sting
How could I fold? It's nothin' but solid niggas on my team
Had to weed out the rats, so I can roll up a bag
These broke niggas leeches, just wanna run up a tab
But so long, I'm so gone
Life goes on, life goes on

Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do

I remember bein' broke
Couple dollars in my pocket, I could barely cop a soda
I didn't know what to do
A college kid lost just like everybody else
Up late tryna figure out myself
Mama had no job so I got a 9 to 5
Just when I thought we lost it all
She said, "Boy be strong, God gon' keep us in our home"
Blessings come true, I swear they do
You might be down at the moment
But stay there and you'll be up soon
I know you're tired of the bus
Stack up and pull off like vroom
Stay consistent and watch how your money moves
And watch how your old friends hate on you
But fuck 'em because

Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on

Sending shots while I'm livin' so lovely, like a star

In love with the big tatas
Su casa, Mi casa
Run in your shit and then take it
Stacking chips like Vegas

Loosie, doosie, the jokes on you, I didn't grow up to Boosie
All I care about is feeding my family and getting out of that Camry
I'm in a Benz and I'm getting a Bentley
I'm reading texts from last night, she said "I love how you bent me"
I just bought a Benz and it said "please tint me"
You wanna buy it but you can't
So you're renting, you'll take it back in 6 months
If there's no denting
7K for the for VVS, white diamond dentals
They say "Yachty are you the nigga with the jingle bell rap?"
I'm cool with that, cause every bitch look at my jingle balls now, I fool with that
I finger roll the ABA in
Top floor, penthouse where I'm staying
I grew up watching Even Stevens
Now Steven ain't nearly as even
But I want to thank you for the entertainment that evening
Yeah, we all laughed at you
'Cause we all know you wouldn't say that if you saw me on your avenue
We all know you aren't built for this shit
I was taught "don't you dare buck if you can't back up your shit"
Every time I wake up, someone new is back on my dick
I used to get baffled, now I sit back and laugh like a bitch
Young as fuck and rich as hell, I can't get mad at this shit

Hold up, let me change the topic real quick

We got a fallen soldier on the internet
Don't believe my net worth on the Internet
It's a lot larger, my dream girl's ex boyfriend drive a Charger
So I know I got a chance with that chick
I used dream about bitches who love all this shit
I used to dream about girls who love all the dick
I used to wear gold so fake, now I iced up the wrist
Hold up, aye, uh, aye, uh
Funkmaster Flex please stop talkin' 'bout me
Unless you're finna play my songs then don't talk about me
Uhm, old man, here's a bar
I hope you fall into a hole where there's no sun or stars

Uh, hold on, aye, uh, uh, aye, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I'm gonna stop, stop, stop, stop
I'm gonna stop



I'm in love with the girl who loves somebody else
And she doesn't pay attention to anybody else

I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no

Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

The time we just spent together
That was the best time we had spent together
That was the first time we had spent together
When you laying in my arms it feels like forever
But when you leave it feels like I'll never see you never

I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no

Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

Red roses, gold skin with your hair
Parted like Moses, I love watching your poses
They posers on the internet, talking 'bout us both, they just vultures
I want your panties wet, wetter than before you were soaker
You a soldier, baby, nothing like that boy, he's a jokester
I know you like me much, but I think you're afraid of the world
They don't like us much, but I'd be proud to call you my girl
I know I ask for much but today, could you rock out those curls?

Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

I miss my brother, that knucklehead nigga

You hold the pistol, that tell me that you 'bout it
You killing someone for me, I don't doubt it
Shut that shit down when a hoe getting rowdy

For all these fuck niggas that need them a plan
First class, we gon' look good forever
Sailing Team shawty, put that on my sweater
Red black SLP's like a game of checkers
Where is my check? spent that on my neck
Boat got them old hundreds, that's for real
Thirty thousand on my neck with no deal

Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all
This two seater, got the heat up in the seats

I wouldn't trust her, you should duck her, she thinks you're a sucker
I had her first, and then my friend, and now she with my brother
I bought the black but then I had to go and change the color
To somethin' crazy, promise you will never see another
Aww yeah, we been winnin' all year
I ran out of time for chasin' after your tears
Whenever you hear music at a party, know she's near

Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved
Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all

I'm in the field, you in the bleachers, smokin' Cali reefer
I need the bag from Indonesia, watch him swipe his Visa
I just went and got the new one, tell that girl to keep up
All I gave him was a teaser, now your dude's a geeker
Mamacita so bonita, but I had to freeze her
It still ain't colder than my car, tell that girl to speed up

Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved
Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all
This two seater, got the heat up in the seats

You're a sneaky one, you thought I didn't know
Yeah I saw you creepin' on your tippy toes
She's conceited, she thinks everyone's beneath her
But oh no, no-no-no, no you got it all wrong
Who you been lyin' to?
You called us boys at the bar, you're a lyin' crew
You better hope you never see her, if you do, you better run
'Cause she's a street sweeper, she's a heartbreaker, she's a money-taker

Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved
Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all
This two seater, got the heat up in the seats

Picturing your face and now the moment's lost
I saw your silhouette under all of the noise
I think I'm losing it inside these empty walls
I thought I heard your voice, I thought I felt your touch
Well I was running with the ghost

Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost

You're done for me
You used to keep Lil Boat company
I used to put no one over you
You keep every nigga under me
I used to rock a Metallica t-shirt
You would call it the thunder tee
I stung you hard like a bumblebee
Now I'm left dead with no sympathy
I fucked up, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miss my fingers running through your hair
Your bed time stares
Oh your lips would gliss even when you glare
You said you feel it in your chest so scream it like Ric Flair
Let me know it's there
Tell me, do you care?

I saw your silhouette under all of the noise
I think I'm losing it inside these empty walls
I thought I heard your voice, I thought I felt your touch
Well I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost

Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost

I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

My whip dripping, too much candy in my paint
Bitches they love RD
They watch me, they love me, they need me like nicotine
Fresher than most, straight off the boat
Counting my dough
Just a red head boy from the city, Versace robe
On me like I'm Diddy
One hand on her titty
Other gripping money
Lifes so sweet right now
Better lock down your hoe
Before I come through your town
Living so profound
Watch them hate me now
Bitches used to talk down
Now they ride like Greyhound
They ride like greyhounds cause I did 'em in and out

I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

I be loaded, too many pistols on my waist
Let a fuck nigga try me, find me a skrrt
I'ma go, I'ma go straight to his house
Gold on my mouth
Coming straight from the south
Me, I look pop right now
Water dripping, someone give me a towel
Man I took off, someone gave me a roll
Good lean when I fuck on yo hoe
Shout out to Roll, that's my big bro
Who is these niggas? Man, nobody knows
Nigga get mad, I put dick in his hoe
Wrap it up, body bagging his hoe, hoe, woah

I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

And it's too much water
Dripping, man it's too much water
Splash, too much water
We too fly, dripping too much water
Too much sauce, we dripping too much water
Lil Yachty drip too much water
Your hoe tryna drink my water

My white bitch, she love to play crocket
She cook the dope up
Hiding the sack in her pocket
I been re sighting the path for the rocket

White hoes playing
White hoes playing
White hoes playing
Why you hoes playing croquet?


Off top, niggas know that I'm the shit
Gotta' iced out wrist that could fuck your baddest bitch
Stacking up doe, switching up swerving on foes
Hard top when the rain drop
Candy apple red Ferrari paint
Make these bitches faint
When I walk past to serve their daddy dank
Make them walk the plank on my new Yacht
Motha' fucka' stupid hoe that's a bitch there

Talk slicker, my stack thicker, my dick bigger
What other else reasons do you want baby?

Hella' lean in my cup, got my eyes lazy

Got my bitch getting wetter like a vet navy

I've been stunting hella' hard with my team lately
I've been strictly on some counting cash tims lately
Stackin' up for that championship ring baby

Bought a new crib and that bitch came with a tennis court

Walked up in that bitch with two bitches you ain't never seen
Perfect parts got me so clean
Paint the Glock white, add the laser, that's vanilla bean
Oops I meant vanilla beam
Counting so much money that my fingers started turning green
Winning so damn much that I now here go by as Charlie Sheen

Old ass rappers talking dust, niggas need to die
One time this bitch had hurt my feelings, so i went to ice the pain

Big bad wolf and this bitch kicking down your door
All these niggas washed up I found them on the shore

Tried to fuck with college  but Lil Yachty ain't a scholar

Moments through the night, I turn to your side
Rub my index finger through your thighs
All of my life, I been feinding for a wife

Right hand gripped with the bun of hair
Waking up without you is such a scare
Gripping on your hips while you hold the chair
At around 3, it's just not fair
Baby, let's live in slow mo
I don't wanna share
Baby, let's live in slow mo
Baby, let's live in slow mo

Shh, I repeat
I am not ashamed
I will not forget your name
I stood out in the rain

I give you everything
I, I
The deeper I go, you feel in your toes
Are you wasting my time?
Please don't do that
Oh no, no

You’ve got Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart
You got Maggie and Santa’s Little Helper to start
At Seven-Forty-Two, in a pink lil' house
Where everything’s coming up Milhouse, D’oh!

Grampa’s yelling at clouds
Willie’s really keeping busy keeping the grounds
Wiggum is commissioner, incompetent officer
And his son Ralph’s doing the un-possible

Springfielders, ask Quimby, there’s plenty
The black one is Carl, the white one is Lenny
So many seasons, you can’t seem to settle on
One, ish longer than Nahasapeemapetilon

Go to Kwik-E-Mart, learn what Apu earns
Hans Moleman was saying boo-urns
Like the Sea Captain, I’m going overboard
I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords

Like Brockman, gimme a Duff, man
I wanna take a Malk but I wanna get drunk, man
Barney’s the barfly at Moe’s who falls
Down while Mike Rotch gives phony calls

Or Otto Mann on “The Bus That Couldn’t Slow Down”
Need a dump truck of money, call Krusty the Clown
Steer clear of Nelson, he’ll laugh at you openly
It’s worse than hearing “Okilly Dokilly”

Flanders, store just for left handers
Bar in the basement, call in Rex Banner
Two sons called Todd and Rod
Whose mom Maude got t-shirt clocked to God

And she’s smoking, like Selma and Patty
Comic Book Guy’s kind of a fatty
Like Fat Tony and Uter with his chocolate
Looking for another? Did you check your pocket?

I’mma school you like Chalmers and Skinner
Serving up steamed hams for dinner
I’m on fire, well, that’s a fallacy
It’s really Aurora Borealis, see?

Burns got a bear and the bear is Bobo
Burns got goons, Crusher and Lowblow
Nothing beats stabbin’ folks with my hobo
Knife, bring back Sheriff Lobo!

Flow so sick, someone call a doctor!
Hibbert is with it but Nick is awful
Hi everybody, it’s Mr. McGreg
With a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!

Smithers can’t enter the League of Extra-Horny Gentlemen
There’s Itchy, there’s Scratchy, and there’s Gentle Ben
They’re all animals, call the hound dogs
Which are back like Alf with the Alf Pogs

Arnie Pye, Artie Ziff and Disco Stu
Martin Prince, McBain, Kirk, LuAnn, Lou
Sideshow Bob, Troy McClure, Radioactive Man
Who had a Fallout Boy before the band

I got more lines than Bart with chalk
I spit more lines than Maggie’s talked
That’s 59 names with more to report, Bort
Until next time, “Eat my shorts!”

With a choosin bitch, and I'm the chosen one
Give y'all niggas the Gucci watch, on my left wrist is the frozen one
All these Louies in the shoe boxes, I don't know what color let me open one
Riding around in this Rolex, hoes tweeting me it's that over ton
That's no lie, circle tighter than a bow tie
I'm high as hell, love Gucci belts no YSL
With a model bitch, and she shy as hell
She don't speak, but she scream loud when you hittin deep
If you don't work, you don't eat
Niggas starving like Marvin, see more green nigga then it's sparking
Like barking, you a funny guy, Martin
If the blunt rolled, then I spark it
Yeah that shit rolled, then I spark it
My bitch mad cause I'm high again, her legs spread and I'm diving in

Diamonds yellow like Pikachu, Louie frames what I'm peeking through

If I don't like that nigga, I'm gone flex on him
These hoes they ain't shit, I don't stress on 'em
True Religion fit, I feel blessed on 'em
Ima shit on these niggas, make a mess on 'em
All my belts and my shoes got the F's on 'em
If I don't like that nigga, I'm gone flex on him
If I don't like that bitch, I'm gone flex on her
These Louie sneakers, bitch come play chess on em

Damn, ran up a sack now I don't know how to act
Walk with that check on my back
Damn, Ran up a sack I don't know how to act

Boot to his face like a motherfuckin' doormat

Say "fuck that bitch" and keep on moving 'fore it haunt you
Don't fuck with many circles tighter than a bantoo
Hate these niggas, they fake with and they fake emo

These niggas try to click it up and run against me

They say don't fuck yo homie bitch that's a no no
I took my old homie bitch and kicked her dolow
Told my nigga mom "but sorry yea he still broke"
But buddy got up in his feelings so it's fucked bro
She popped 6, now she ride dick like a volvo
And snorting way more lines than a bar code
I'm not bucking but i'm ready with the arms bar
Hit his chest, now his name in an article
It's Young Boat put a nigga in they place

Nut on her face, fuck up her veins
Choke slam a nigga, like I was Kane
Choppa it sing like Zayn

We pull up to the spot then we make it pop
Then we make it pop, then we make it pop

By the time I turn 50

Cikán mívá černé oči
Chodí nocí zlou
A kde nespí hodné dítě
Vezme si je ve své sítě
Houpy hou

Pak je veze ve svém voze
V dálku nocí zlou
špatně se mu v noci spinká
Bez maminky, bez tatínka
Houpy hou

Na kozlíku starý cikán
Koně letí tmou
Přes bláto a přes kamení
V povětří se čerti žení
Houpy hou

Žáby spustí na močálu
Smutnou píseň svou
Netopýři sametoví
Probudí na věži sovy
Houpy hou

Když v postýlce hodné dítě
Spí až do rána
Na řasách zavřených víček
Tancuje mu andělíček
Tananynky, tananá



Můj příběh je prostý a začíná tady
Sedím si v hospodě mezi kamarády a
Zrovna když u piva upíjím pěnu
Naproti u baru uvidím ženu

Ta žena je krásná její neskutečný vnady
Mi řikaj' kámo - teď a tady
Tady a teď svůj šarm rozjeď
Kolem prstu si ji vomotej a pak si ji vodveď

Tak vytáhnu kytaru zabrnkám na city
Jeden dva songy - starý dobrý hity
A pak už jen čekám až zvlhnou ji oči a
Úplně hotová mi do náruče skočí

Ale co to je? co se to děje?
No to snad ne snad se nesměje
Proč se tváří jako bych byl ňákej hmyz
Tvý songy budou nadosmrti staře znít
Pokud v nich nebude hustej rap a vostrej beat

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
Nevim jak se správně řikaj hiphopový mantry

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny vás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele

Můj příběh byl jiný a začal tam kde
Pokud si opravdu dobře vzpomínám
Skončil ten tvůj u kytary a piva
A naproti mně se posadila Iva

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a country

Ty chceš repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny nás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To ti ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svíráš držíš jako ukulele

Ukulele ukulele uuukuuuleeeleee

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a kántry
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a kántry

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Wabiho i daňka posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele



Sbohem a kdybychom se nikdy nesetkali
Bylo to překrásné a bylo toho dost
Sbohem a kdybychom si spolu schůzku dali
Možná že nepřijdem že přijde jiný host

Bylo to překrásné žel všecko má svůj konec
Mlč umíráčku ten smutek já už znám
Polibek kapesník siréna lodní zvonec
Tři čtyři úsměvy a potom zůstat sám

Sbohem a kdybychom si neřekli už více
Ať po nás zůstane maličká památka
Vzdušná jak kapesník prostší než pohlednice
A trochu mámivá jak vůně pozlátka

A jestli viděl jsem co neviděli jiní
Tím lépe vlaštovko jež hledáš rodný chlév
Ukázalas mi jih kde máš své hnízdo v skříni
Tvým osudem je let mým osudem je zpěv

Sbohem a bylo-li to všecko naposledy
Tím hůře mé naděje nic vám nezbude
Chcem-li se setkati nelučme se raděj tedy
Sbohem a šáteček Vyplň se osude!
