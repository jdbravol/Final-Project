[Intro]
First things first: Rest In Peace Uncle Phil, for real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'mma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga...

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch; not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up and tell her
"Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'mma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood, bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck em then we kick em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap, she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt
'Fore she leave—I'mma need my shirt back
Nigga, you know how it go

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas—probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once—shame on—shame on you. Fool me—you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

[Hook: J. Cole]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd; totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I fill on you, I'm sayin'...

[Refrain: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you

[Bridge: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me 20 dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game, like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together!
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but...

[Refrain: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Bridge: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Hook: J. Cole]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

[Intro]
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well

[Verse 1]
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it
If she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked
When you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan"
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck

[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on, how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth
Yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause…"

[Hook]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no



[Hook: TLC]
Even though I
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked – look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (this crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail, wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, I'm well now
If you askin' will I tell now – ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' because man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (that crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Ad-Libs: Choir]

[Outro: Choir]
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Intro]
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Hook]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

[Hook]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend

Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Bridge]
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising

[Outro]

Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

Ay Hollywood, ay Hollywood Cole, go

[Verse 1]
You wanna know just where I'm at, well let me tell you 'bout it

They tryna say I can't come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them niggas I come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run

Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait

Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe

[Pre-Hook]
I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind

Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
(This is the part that the thugs skip)
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through (The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singing

Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'mma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'mma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everbody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho

[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I



[Intro]
Love yourz
Love yourz
No such thing

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 1]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block
Man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons
Cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes
That's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Outro]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?

Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved



[Produced by Vinylz]

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

[Intro: J. Cole]
She knows, she knows
Hey

[Background Sample: Amber Coffman]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I’ve never had much sympathy
Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
Oh I, oh I-I-I (I’m gonna run run away, run run away, run away)
Well alright (Run away and never come back)
Oh I, oh I-I-I(Run run away, run run away, run away show ‘em that your)
Well alright (color is black)

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch In his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Hook: J.Cole]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can’t be what you want from me
Well alright

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, that she want
What she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose

[Hook: J.Cole]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can’t be what you want from me
Well alright

[Refrain: J.Cole]
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die

[Bridge: J.Cole]
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie

[Outro: J.Cole]
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
For your eyes only



[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, took a lil' sip
T-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Me and my bitch, took a little trip

Bitches come and go (You know that)

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

[Hook]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-T-Took a little, took a little, took a little sip

[Bridge]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch

[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Ight, look look, park right here
I'mma be out it'll be like thirty minutes tops
It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let me see that, oh shit what is that some
What's, what the fuck is that platinum
Is that? What's that chain right there
Is that-ss-ss white gold, that's platinum
Is that plat, well niggas doing platinum again, niggas doing, niggas ain't even platinum yet right, oh shit bout to make
Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch



[Verse 1]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan; I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas god damn it
Cause I ain't never had a lot damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Outro]
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"



[Produced by Willie B]

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Aye who am I? (Yeah)

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]
I never felt better



[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world
But while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA," (in that order)
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained
At the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen
Ripe with pain, listen...



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated; look, Mama, we made it
Your son out in Barbados; cheese, eggs and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute?
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's: that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue about the same thing
Tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing?

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay
But you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby, I love to call your name, name, name

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl
Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed but her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories about different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay
But you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby, I love to call your name, name, name



[Intro]
I'm a born sinner, but I die better than that, swear
It's way darker this time

[Hook]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Cole

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough
Look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers trying to steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet
I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up
Fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK's slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot
Okay, faggot?
Don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya?
Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James
Wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it
Nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Diggah Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it, it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know
In a year he'd be fucking paying me
What could you say to me?
I beat the odds like Vegas
I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free
Pardon me

[Hook]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got the game back, and I ain’t ever letting go

[Verse 2]
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

[Bridge]
My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

[Refrain]
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3]
This next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga
Young Black millionaire
Old White billionaires
I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I could've been a summa cuma laude
Beyonce told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth
I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

[Interlude]
Hey J. Cole, this way hey
Oh hey what's up, what's goin' on with you? Ok
Big smile man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

[Verse 3]
Re-adjustin' my target audience
Cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind
Just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning
The thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here
Mask my tears, but I

[Bridge]
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

[Outro]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner



[Produced by J. Cole & Nate Jones]

[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

[Hook]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label—are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

[Hook]
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm a shame, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 3]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open up doors
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars, and so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

[Hook]
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin



[Intro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Work out for me, work out for me)

[Hook]
Aye, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, "Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?"
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: "Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there."
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life
Take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Hook]
Aye, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, "Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?"
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: "You go, girl!"
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two-door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Hook]
Aye, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, "Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?"
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!

[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Hook]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas sun
Yeah I said 'sun'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

[Hook]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God (Cole the God, Cole the God)
January 28th

[Outro]
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune
(Sound of baby laughing)
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars of a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune



[Intro]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro]
(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro—



[Chorus (Condensed)]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsals
If I died today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to
"Be all that you can be" posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day that you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music business is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane"
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Hook: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: J. Cole]
This shit is a gift



[Intro]
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time



[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life—is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit… You ain't shit, nigga!"

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion
But what about your seed, nigga?

[Outro]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it



[Intro (Sampled): Mike Epps]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they? You see 'em with their wife, "What's up Tony?" "Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright." You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?" "Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!"

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah
Give me my space, Lord ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, na mean I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down, but you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfucking games begin
I'm running away

[Hook: J. Cole]
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour?"
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
She losing faith in him and he knows the shit
Like what the fuck is a break, don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got till it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack, we bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evening
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you...

[Hook: J. Cole]
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know...

[Hook: J. Cole]
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on



[Verse 1]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline
I'm tryna get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollering, who was that?
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout do with that?
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Hook]
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldn't judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin'
And you know just what Im talkin' about, tomorrow you'll be callin' out
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warning

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hipster rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave
Know you as tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this song
Thought they knew me, well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
But happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and J. Cole]

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you

Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can’t forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It’ll get better

[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows

Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”



[Intro]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Look, know some hoes from the past like
"Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "Be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in that bitch
No more sleeping in my brothers room
Like man I might as well be sleeping in my mother room
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair
This is so pure, this is so clear
This is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here
Nigga I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast yeah
Avoiding the snakes, AK's, and coke yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city of New York nine years
Ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy

[Hook]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)

[Verse 2]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover, now your mag on my penis
Like damn he turned out to be a genius
Damn real shit, nigga no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me

[Hook]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't start! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)

[Verse 3]
(Let it rock)
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Yeah, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative, nigga is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with



[Refrain]
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

Troubles of this...
Troubles of this world

[Verse 1]
Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say "Live fast, die young," so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard "Can't Get Enough"
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, "The Things Hoes Say"
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

[Hook]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Take it to the promise land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

[Refrain]
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

[Verse 2]
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off of her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like "Don't you know this shit already?
Nigga, ain't you rich already?"
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho
Had a nigga baby, little mans don’t know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
Twelve years later when my song come on, he ask
"Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?"
Whoa

[Hook]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Take it to the promise land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

[Refrain]
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right
I said liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life



[Hook]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

[Hook]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Bridge 1]
Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

[Verse 2]
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

[Bridge 2]
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

[Hook]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Outro]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?



[Intro]
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

[Bridge]
For you I drop the tough guy shit, on this bus I sit
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you

[Verse 1]
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

[Bridge]
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift? (Am I strong enough to lift?)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)

[Verse 2]
Ib gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit, hey mama look what God made
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

[Outro]
There is a God, it is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time



[Intro]
I see the, I see the—
I see the, I see the—
I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

[Verse]
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord

[Chorus]
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

[Outro]
Bells gettin' louder, louder
I see the rain
Pouring down

Ten toes to the ground

[Hook 1]
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight these demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain? blaow
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight them demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?

[Verse 1]
If I quote it nigga, I wrote it nigga
Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga
Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga

[Hook 2]
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?
(Right there let me get that there)
Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?
Nada
(If you really believe it, gotta talk about it
You heard about what happens when you talk about it
Niggas lookin’ at you funny when they start to doubt it
Fucking up your energy when you start to doubt it too)
Rollercoaster ride
(Start to doubt it too)
How much do it cost?
(Start to doubt it)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost
(Shoutout my nigga Ib)
Rollercoaster ride, how much do it cost?
(El Presidente and shit)
(He want me to talk my shit for y'all)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost

[Verse 2]
Cole world you should stay off this dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand

[Outro]
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker
"When you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...
(Censor Tone)



Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Art of seduction
Hoes jump like Vince Carter backstage like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams you gotta start off with somethin'
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin'
Found it funny cuz now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin' on
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs
But I love when they come on
Word?

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted, ?look in the blocks with mindplay?
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, how could you not taste it?

[Verse 2]
That's a little egotistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's RG
Cause he know bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know, hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me, you keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get, a bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch, while you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick
She thinking she got a first round pick, she thinking 'bout all the things she can get, she thinking you got a Range for a whip, and a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word, wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs.. Aye

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted, ?look in the blocks with mindplay?
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick
Girl, how could you not taste it?



[Intro]
This right here is not a preview
I need to let it go, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he's throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying: "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...

[Verse 2]
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them 90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
Cause I'm finta, drop knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dumbies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets, but nigga that ain't really where they were
Acting just like there they were, but who am I to judge?
That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If i had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera, at the same time
And put name tags on they titties so I don’t get they name wrong
Screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from sampling now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas, 
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer
But the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go

[Hook]

[Outro]
June 25th. Born Sinner. Bitch



[Verse 1]
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short, fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains, Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer, hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World, it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now, couldn't be more herer
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 2]
Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', "how did he manage?"
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?!"
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 3]
I made it to the rack, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start
My life’s like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights please

[Hook]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"

[Hook]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
[Outro]
Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's "Dead Presidents", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like "yo". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like "Yo", like, "Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again. Just almost like, just to prove to that nigga and kinda prove to myself that you I can, I can maybe get a little...



[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Bridge]
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright



[Hook]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Verse]
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces

[Hook]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Interlude]
My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—
And she say, "clean up"—I say—

[Bridge]
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never

[Hook]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Outro]
I get mad and I slam my door and go in my room—
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"



[Hook]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

[Bridge]
I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever
Something that's old as forever
Love, love, love, love

[Hook]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

Love, love, love, love



[Intro]
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom
Then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second
Watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's "Fuck the government!"
They see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 2]
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down
And showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics."
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better
For your kids before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 3]
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See, the people at the top
They get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla "Revolution!"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played
Then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution
Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said, what good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna
(High for hours, nigga)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go



[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
"And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country"

Excuse me

[Verse 1]
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

[Hook]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Verse 2]
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag

[Hook]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Outro]
They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, uh, yo
You gotta li—, you gotta follow me
With what I'm doin' right here, mane
Like, when I say this shit is crazy
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'—
Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Aye, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help

[Verse]
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be



[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1]
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

[Hook]
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Ay from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie"
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile

[Singing Sample]
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home

[Hook]
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood



[Intro: Jay-Z]
There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between eating the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot
I'mma find him though, I'mma sign him..
I don't want no problems

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
Took my time, crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine, Cole World
Same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic
Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick I just flow and niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot, bang!

[Hook]
Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 2]
Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life taper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
I hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina, "Shut up, Cole!"
This is for my niggas back home, homes, what up, bo?
This is for the bitches that played me, what up, ho?
Nah I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
Is Cole still at it? Y'all be talkin' about the same shit
That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole's planning funerals, you might fit the coffin

[Hook]
Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 3]
Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
But if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna, hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no

[Outro]
If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take



These niggas know

[Verse 1]
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed; no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 2]
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that,but I never fly that
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacker that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggas know
If not, these niggas know

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I must confess, I cut the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know



[Verse]
Mo Money, yeah
Mo Money, Blow Money, Show Money
Party Money, Side Ho Money, Dope Money
New Clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with petroleum and coal money
Probably kill they selves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Pop off, robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga get your money"



[Intro]
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

[Verse 1]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "There go your chain my nigga"

[Hook]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear
They even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what

[Hook]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear

[Verse 3]
Lord, this is the last time
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said this shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
Cause I love this slavery
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I said this is my last time

Okay I lied



[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey... huh, Cole World
Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, everybody got a bad side, drop, let me see that shit
What you say? "Cole ain't hot," what?
Where you read that shit? You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?
Have you seen my shows? Have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot, would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting that, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me, boy, I'm red hot, aw, nigga, they not
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere they not (I said)
You'll never play me, nice try, balling in a nice spot
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot
So, you can look, but don't touch
I stay on my toes like the White Sox, cause

[Hook: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high-roller
Now it's racks on racks, never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?
Young, black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas Eve
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench
Now wonder why I didn't quit the team, but
I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World 'til the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please, I gotta make history

[Hook: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no, you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I got a Hublot, I call it Tebow
I strap that bitch with a gator band
Y'all niggas ball half-time, y'all niggas like the Gator band
Y'all niggas need a time out
Who got these niggas all wound up?
Cocksucker, I'm 730
Y'all know where y'all niggas gonna wind up?
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit yall niggas with a nice shot
Y'all niggas better not call the law
Get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning y'all better not waste my time
When y'all ready I take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors
Put the front on the back, cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'Bach like a boss
So I'm fronting on niggas when I'm backing off
What up, Cole? It's your time, let's these niggas know
Adjust your Rollie on these motherfucking hoes
Whenever you ready, go

[Outro: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
(Ugh, nice watch)



[Intro: J.Cole]
Now do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?
Do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm back on a mission
To pay my tuition
Got loans out the ass
What you know 'bout my past?
I was so late for class
Hit the probate, get trashed
Fell asleep off the Henny
Back in '08 I crashed
With my foot on the gas
Thank the Lord I'm still here
No insurance so now I'm racin' home on first gear
On that morn' I shed tears
Asking what I'm doing here
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she's just jackin' me off
I needed more
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store
Put my feet on floor
Borrow money from mi amor
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round

[Hook: J. Cole]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas (What?)
Gold diggers, Crys sippers (What?)
Cold nigga, flow sicker (What?)
Muthafucka, I'm a fuckin' head bussa go
Coming down on the strip liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old
But errthing that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener I've been told
She told me, boy you want your cake and eat it too
I said its cake, that's what you're supposed to do

[Verse 2]
Ok my granny just died, but I'm too broke to go
And she askin my fears but she too close to know
Got trust issues I'm trying, where it come from? Don't know
I just block out the pain, blow the fuck up get dough
See i thought that would help me, it turns out its worse now
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out
My mama don't see me unless I'm on tv, I pray she dont break down
She strong but she need me
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new thangs
She still a dime, but I always lose change
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains
In a new Range
She tellin' me so much has happened
Would've thought you changed
We ain't fuck in nine months its safe to say I'm due man

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my niggas die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying to pull away.  At no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took off running

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired 7 more shots and my friend died

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free



Yeah, hey, Cole world

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

[Bridge]
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a Dream in case yeen know

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, ya'll on one, I'm on mine
You logged off cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? my fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "god damn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, "bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will
Cole!

[Bridge]
Young nigga with his jeans low

So if it's bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Outro]
Hey, cause nigga that's life, and trust me I'm livin'
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given
Look what a nigga made out
Look what a nigga made out
Got a dollar and a dream

[Intro: David Ruffin]
Sometimes I think about it
And my poor heart wants to die about it
Woooooo about the sweet sweet love I lost
And the way I got double crossed
By a guy who was my friend, I see him now and then
But I pretend I'm doing fine, when I'm about to lose my mind

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast
Money fallin out my pockets I got too much cash
Can't fit nothin in her pockets she got too much ass like goddamn
Well if you must ask
We from the school of hard knocks but your crew cut class
Half white but don't think I got a Klu Klux pass
When I'm up in the V, police be fuckin with me
No sir no license all I got here is this fuckin degree
Move along cocksucker ain't nothin to see
Unless you talkin blockbusters, you niggas is not Russell
You more Diggy - me I'm more Biggie
No diss to the young boy im just rappin get bored quickly
Just to make up for that line invite him on tour with me
Show him the game let him finagle these whores with me
Run through they doors with me, hit the Ritz-Carlton for the night
Leave him there with two dykes probably change a nigga life right
What up Vanessa, I loved you that one semester
Thanks to my profession I balled like Uncle Fester
Thinkin about the board I use to have above the dresser
Half the shit I wrote down I did it, its old now got
New goals, plus my money on Manute Bol
Funny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows
Tired of every chick sayin she models before she swallow
So I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals

[Bridge]
Niggas keep askin me how I feel how ya feel
It's Coleee

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not even slightly interested in what ya opinion is
I gotta greater purpose then a hater purpose
I'mma stack paper, hustle just to relax later
Serve niggas and bring change that's a waiter's purpose
Look how I made em nervous, niggas is shakin, I know they fakin'
Okay you a killer right, and Miss Cleo is Jamaican
And Bob Marley is Haitian and me and Beyonce datin'
And Jesus Christ be hatin, got mad love from Satan
For fuckin Sanaa Lathan while Meagan Good is waitin'
I'm the deadbeat father of your little brother
In other words goddamnit I'm a bad motherfucker
It's Cole, it's only right I brought back the soul
Y'all got way too electro, damn near techno
Halfway homo, way too metro
Hennesy XO, Cole flow special
Style like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row
Learn somethin boy, grow yo ass up
Cheap nigga if you was liquor I'd probably throw yo ass up
Matter a fact if you was grass I'd probably mow yo ass up
Last call for you old niggas go and pour yo last cup

[Outro: J. Cole]
Yea, yea, yea yea, Cole World
This nigga Ib...he's a bitch
He told me to talk shit to you niggas, so I'mma talk my shit
Dreamville in the building
I know what y'all want me to talk about, what y'all want to me to discuss
But we'll get to that later; them bitch ass niggas...
My nigga Big Sean in the building
My nigga Canei on the beat



[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs Huxtable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn’t buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man, thats just life thats how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with cupid
He beat you and you went back, who's officially stupid?
Oh yeah I understand that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know thats a bad look
Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
Cole

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Time to save the world, bearing the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know, so many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes, but I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path, I know my heart will guide me back

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yea, man, is this too deep for the intro? If so I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and mothafuckers that hated school
Said "thats for busters," then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ay possibly cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash
Wasn't experienced, so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy starin' out my blinds
Till I got free from my momma leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play, pardon me
Whats your name, don’t mistake me for no lame, no not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, even-tu-ally R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that just how its happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
Cause see some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot em down

Ha. Yeah nigga. Hell Yeah! I felt that one in my fuckin soul

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere



[Intro: J. Cole]
This for all my niggas in the city
But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though, ya know?
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Getting money regiment with my get money regime
Nah mean? yeah

[Verse 1 : J Cole]
New York times, come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money, it seems, by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch, I blow a kiss at her daughter
In the city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibly stressin', a mess, he smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that, all I do is pray for that
This the city of God told me "Go and make it" at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 2 : J Cole]
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick, that's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparations for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We dont make it primetime till we dyin'

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 3: Bas]
How I go from selling reefer and plates
Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly integrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart
Nigga, bitch nigga, take a pause
Hundred shots through the dark you can never hit my heart

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York



[Intro]
Cole World, the new Nat King
If I ain't the illest nigga, I'm his new vaccine
Really more like poison when his New Jack Swing
And my bed is like a deck of cards - two black queens
A nigga don't like me, he just a fucking hater
What you made last week, I just tipped the fucking waiter
What that feel like? Tell me what that feel like?
Nigga fuck your Twitter, bitches follow me in real life

[Interlude]
Welcome back, ladies and gentleman, to a brand new season. Dreamville, Cole World. So much has happened in our time apart
I can’t wait to share it with you all in due time. Did you miss me?
I know I missed you. Can’t believe these niggas ain’t rap on this shit man...

[Verse 1]
Heard niggas got beef
Then they see me on the street, and don't speak
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak
Yeah, I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips
Meanwhile I’m on the strip, putt puttin’ wit ya bitch
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160
Bitch don’t fuck with me, trust nigga I’m sick
Can’t tag me, fuck nigga I’m it—watch this
With my heart on my sleeve I bleed pardon my greed
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity
How can it be I blew up singlehandedly
Nobody handed me shit
Granted though, I planned to be rich
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly
On cameras but won’t holla at family only randomly
After a few drinks come our realest convos
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo’s
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I’m still mulatto
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said “hell if I know,” shit
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming
Name should be Abe Lincoln ‘cause I cannot tell a lie though
All facts in fact, been all that
Before Kenan and Kel swallow the key to my cell
Which means, I got an impossible lock to pick
And if you want my spot, you gotta go through lots of shit
Nigga, Cole the truth, you the opposite
I be tryna figure out why I cannot commit
With who I’ve known for years, is it hoes or fear
Meanwhile she wonder if the one she chose is pure
No cure for the cold, rather Cole the cure
Them last lines was more honest than your whole career
Nigga, you a phony, only got few homies
I prefer lonely, you rap niggas don’t know me
Staying to myself, not concerned ‘bout my health
I’m a mothafucka and yo baby mother is a milf
Couple years ago they had a nigga sitting on the shelf
Now they tell me “man you like the realest shit I ever smelt”
They say, “Boy you got the belt"
"Plus you better than so-and-so!”
I keep it modest but inside I already know it though
Yea thanks my nigga, yea thanks my nigga
I deserve but nah this ain’t Tank my nigga
Leave the party like I just robbed a bank my nigga
Bag full of money, fuck yo debate my nigga
‘Cause two years ago and I ain’t make it, I was pissed
But you care a little less about a list when you rich, nigga
When you rich nigga...

[Interlude]
But that’s not what we came here for. We didn’t come here to brag; we didn’t come here to boast, to stunt. We just came here to flex. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your patience. I assure you, it’ll be well worth the wait. In the meantime, if I can get right back into it though. Check it...

[Verse 2]
How many Kanye beats do a nigga gotta murder
To prove my mind’s further, hater nigga converter
Took kids to Carowinds which I’m sure you never heard of
‘Cause I didn’t tell the news or the Fayetteville Observer
I don’t do it for the press, I’m blessed, I made it out
Sitting on this plane, my biggest thing to complain about
Somewhere between yesterday and now
I done lost my jewelry, Rollies, chains, almost lost my cool
But see, I just left kids who ain’t got a fucking thing
‘Cept a lot of fucking problems and a lot of fucking pain
And here I go bitching ‘cause my Jesus piece missing
Got a feeling housekeeping finally caught a nigga slipping
Eyes wide open, they just found a pot of gold
Now lil’ Julio is somewhere shining on you hoes
But that’s how it goes, fuck it I’m still breathing
Like my lil’ nigga Jaheim, we here for a reason

[Outro]
That’s my lil’ man Jaheim. He said, “Cole, can you shout me out on a song?” I was like, “I don’t know man,” but in my mind I knew I would shout him out though, you know—Fayettenam, 2-6. Dreamville. We from a different world. Cole World...



[Intro: Simba & Dad]
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here, and will rise upon you as the new king
And this will all be mine?
EVERYTHING
Everything the light touches

[Intro]
In my freshest J's, I ain’t slept in days
Girl, you gonna make me late undressing me
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”

Bitch, I’m the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch
Bitch, I’m the man of the year

[Verse]
What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blinding
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said “I gotta get my weight up”
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed with my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”
Being good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you’ll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it
18 and under, that’s prolly gonna take a minute
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years ’til I know 30
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo’
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starin’ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
With dessert to take, with dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime
Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds



[Intro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like

[Verse 1]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha, bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "when?", bitch! When I feel like it

[Hook]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy!
I got what you need right here
I got what you need right here
I got what you need right here
I got what you need right here

[Verse 2]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy!
I got what you need right here
I got what you need right here
I got what you need right here
I got what you need right here

[Outro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like, hey



[Intro: J. Cole & Lauryn Hill]
One day, you're gonna understand...
Can I holla at you? Let me holla at you!

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Special, never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a, son to his mother
Or a, sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don't even speak
But know it's love though
Could never let em' dirty your name
I got the utmost respect for you
Came back home and had to check for you
Word round town is you locked down
Some older nigga snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be—
She like, "If you was me you wouldn't wait for me
Living fast and wouldn't mash the brakes for me"
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me
The day you played my momma you played me
Can't believe I let you in my heart nigga
I should've, followed my instincts a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sense danger in my house
I was too young to scrap you but damn if I ain't want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you
Uh, thirteen years knew you more than my real pops
Put me on to 'Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops
Who would've thought you'd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga "why you lie?"
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppings
Heard you tryna' talk, tell that punk don't call me
You ain't shit and I'm scared it rubbed off on me

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit I hope it ain't true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you
Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don't know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing, you expecting me to act strange
Ain't holla but you on my mind nigga
I dont forget the good times nigga
White tee's in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
We had potential to be monumental, 'ville mentality
You know that old kill or be killed mentality
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin' hoes like the old days, but now we overseas, dawg
Congratulations on your seed
Yo my nigga, can I holla at you?

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—



[Verse 1]
Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you fuck you cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down, I break down
Can't help but break down, I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break, break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speaking
But tonight I see the devil creeping
Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in 7 seasons
Damn! She do the best that she can
Her mama telling her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinking tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down
Uh, break, break down...

Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down...



[Intro]
Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out

[Hook]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

[Verse 2]
War stories, got tour stories
Pop four whores on the top floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick, that's my ex-bitch, homie, in fact I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slimmin' but her eggs get runny, funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money, from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow up dolls, cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!

[Hook]



[Intro: JaVonte,  J. Cole]
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, often I'm caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gena face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly
Look, shawty, ain't no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don' seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell 'em "please refrain."
I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame
Cause tonight, I got you calling out Jesus name, hey

[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Often I'm caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
To try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, I'm ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devil's song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that I'm a pyro
Maniac, I said "Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best."
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then "ding ding," the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
I'm starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say, yo?

[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

[Outro: J. Cole]
I'm losing temptation



[Intro]
Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Get paid a pretty Penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"
With the flick of the pen write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil Maine is the best mc out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters

[Pre-Hook]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 2]
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke"
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place
In that PJ Rose, I drink that shit by the case
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win
Street life will have you drunk, I'm talkin Seagram’s Gin
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life and Times
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart
Life is staged I'll just play my part

[Hook]



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck ya girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy, what you think?", "Little girl, you're growin' up
Growin up"

[Hook]
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?" "little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl (x3)

She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Can I get a witness, this is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey, Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up, growin' up"

[Hook]
Hey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up"
Hey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl (x3)

She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl



[Intro]
"Yeah, nigga
I'mma go ahead and murder this shit
Voice gone and shit, I think it's gon' make it sound a lil--a lil ill...
A lil' iller
Yeah, fayettenam... nigga."

[Verse]
Yeah, Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya na’ lie
My world a little darker, like a fuckin' tan line
Go on, look for a better nigga: girl you can’t find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma’am, I’m an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I’m armed and I’m Fayetnam’s finest
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it’s all said and done I’mma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins. Bad chicks? Send em in
Basic hoes? Toss em out, can’t even get Waffle House
Hatin’ niggas? Chalk em out. Go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about? Lil man
My shit here burning, you not even lil’ tan
I’m ill enough to kill cancer: baby, I’m chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you-know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, "girl, I don’t care"
You better get yours fore I reach mine
Cause then I’m throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum: Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I’m quarterbacking, trying to get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever, Cole is like the leader
Of the new niggas, to tell the truth I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of you niggas get lapped, I sit back
And reflect on the rap game
I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out “The ‘Ville, I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that vagina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer
I could give a fuck as long as there’s something that’s behind of her
Got the type of bump that make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I’m the shit...oh yeah, I’m reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem
And I’m ghost



[Hook: J. Cole]
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds
My main chick she got real hair, never had to shop to get her's
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat, but goddamn she rocking them furs
Ball so hard mothafucka wanna fine me, and now the hoe wanna climb me
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching 'oops nigga
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no budget
Go! Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ayy
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?
Next time I'ma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon' shock her
"You're so tall, what team do you play for?" No bitch, I'm a doctor
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah
Float like a propeller, no helicopter shit
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber
Nigga say they pop cause they dont fill they collars up
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up
Bitch nigga...

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (2 Chainz)
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start off with these four bars
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar
I'm rockin' gold bars, whoop your ass with this crowbar
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin' re-coupe
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin' on gas, full service
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Outro: J Cole]
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow
Please don't tell my momma I spent my tuition on these bottles
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'



[Verse 1]
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband

[Hook]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'mma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though I'm never going back

[Hook]

[Outro]
I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me



[Intro]
Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 1]
Hey, who dat, who dat? That nigga you been waiting for
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshitting, fuck it I ain't hating though
Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back

[Hook]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 2]
Hey, the mind state of a winner
When you thinking about summertime I'm thinking about the winter
When you thinking about breakfast I'm heating up my dinner
I was plotting this moment back when y'all was riding spinners
Yeah I'm a menace, God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me, “Ain't you Roc? But where the fuck your chain at?”
Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to your day job, said you was hot? Well, they lied
Is that your girl? Well, I just G'd her, no A-Rod

[Hook]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Interlude: Andre 3000]
Now who else want to fuck with Hollywood Cole?

[Verse 3]
The little engine that could, this little nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick, I heal niggas for good
A couple of y'all ain't took a field trip to the hood
And me? I'm fresh prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't saying names but we not the same
All the money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might want to grab you a chain, want to tip up your hat
Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack
I got my finger on the trigger, tell that nigga, “hold that”
Want picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey, so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I'm young, black, gifted, live my life on the run
Bet your bottom dollar before I'm done
They say that I'm the one, ya nigga I'm the one
I got them saying

[Hook]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Intro]
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And im all up in that spot
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Though it blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Mate this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like

[Outro]
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey



[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me
Soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama
On my mama, we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
They say we won't last
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad
Good chick, alone, mad as fuck, she done had enough
I be, out here tryna raise my status up
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, who ain't about nothin'
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart, long before I broke your heart
If I lost your respect, I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been a while
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now
And times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same ?
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from friends to somethin' much more
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more
Second chances, we gave enough
'Til finally we gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)



[Intro]
Up up and away, hey, do you trust me?
Would you love me then it must be

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'mma
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer
Uh, you niggas so last summer
On to the new, on-on to the new shit
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me
Two years later bitch we made it on, on to the Blueprint
Now how's that for persistence?
Cole World comin', call back up assistance
Same broads used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball
Put money over bitches, but we still underdogs

[Hook]
Did you miss me? I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me? Up, up and away
Hey, do you trust me?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?
Then it must be a match made in heaven
God's Gift, God's Gift, God's Gift
Mothafucker this is God’s gift

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Pussy my passion
Man I just can’t help it I see a cookie, I grab one
Lookin' for some nookie, I’m tryna scoop me a bad one
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one
Ever since I got on
I’ve been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on
Ex-cheerleader, hollerin' what’s up
Now her nigga beat her, now that’s fucked up
What type of little fuck boy hit a
Woman, bet he wouldn’t put his hands on a nigga
I ain’t bitter boy that’s all you
Plus I just fucked her fore she called you
Dry your eyes baby, I’ll drive you home
Older hoes sayin' "my how you’ve grown"
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I’ll survive on my own

[Hook]
Did you miss me? I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me? Up, up and away
Hey, do you trust me?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?
Then it must be a match made in heaven
God's Gift, God's Gift, God's Gift
Mothafucker this is God’s gift



[Intro]
Ok I lied

Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood, true lie
See I would but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo bitch give yo niggas dap
The hood gon' ballistic, "Cole was here and you missed it"
"That nigga walk like Obama man
Shook yo momma hand and then kissed it"
This pimp shit, this pimp shit

Ya bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit

Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit

For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)

My nigga Syience killed this motherfucking beat



[Verse 1]
I hit the weed I told myself the last time would be my last
I don’t trust my own niggas now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass
Boy you know my L’s dirty, if they stop me I’m goin to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell no bail for me
Man let me out send me back to bitches that smell purdy
And all I gotta do is call once and she 'dere all ready
Yeah buddy can't you tell I'm goin through hell
I don’t even open my mail
I’m in the shower with soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now i’m getting plenty money

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yea
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 2]
Look kid, its raining outside boy
Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yea
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin’
Cole the wrong one bringin’ the city shine
All he ever doin’ is paintin’ pictures of crime
Tellin’ stories of pain, paintin’ pictures of dope
Bitch if you listenin' I’m paintin’ pictures of hope
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin’ my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin’ the streets hey ma I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin’ hoes, was out hoopin’
Them niggas wasn’t ballin’ but yet they was foul shootin’
So meet the newest role model who don’t know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yea
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Outro]
Girl it’s been so long, I’ve been gone from you
But you ain’t gotta worry ’bout the thangs I do
It’s hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon’ know our name
Ain’t seen you smile in awhile
But I been dreamin’ ’bout you



Yeah, what's up girl?

[Verse 1]
Angel eyes, long hair, I see you cryin', what's wrong there
"He did what? He fucked who?", we know the story, what's new?
See I could probably rush you, tell you that he shoulda loved you
Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score, you got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode; why we cheat, I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
Like heterosexuals, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
I never told, I never told

[Interlude 1]
Father: Hey you wanna be a man?
Son: Yeah I wanna be a man
Father: A man don't run and tell his mama everything he see
Son: I ain't gon' tell
Father: Alright, alright then man, be a man then
Son: Alright

[Verse 2]
Ok, that's what it is, I see the game, the hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange, fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The OG's that beat the game, forever young, Peter Pan
35? Still playing; Child support? Still paying
Juggling, bill paying, been running round, field daying
Wine and dine, meal paying, with hopes that she'll lay in
The bed and, get wet then, give head then, you bet man
The same girl who said we just met man, game colder than the fucking dead man
One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids or Reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressed and don't wanna be your ex-man
Cause Cupid aims and throw the darts, there go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?

[Interlude 2]
Wife: You know what? I need to talk to you
Husband: About what?
Wife: I don’t think this is, working out for us
Husband: Why?
Wife: I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that’s all
Husband: What the fuck?!”
Wife: You know?



[Intro: J. Cole]
Tick
This is for my niggas in the fourth quarter
Just watching that clock tick. Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You said, "at what point do you start seeing bread?
Been out hustling for years, shoe box right under my bed
I move the work out my momma’s house, got me a little old crib
I always fantasize if I had went to college instead
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek I’m better off dead
Fucking with this white, it’s all been downhill like a sled
Now listen, I understand they say you make your own bed
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread
In denial about the feds, he can’t see past bread
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?
These are the times, survival my only crime
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone
Inside of me Lord I know, it’s a lie that we gon' be fine
But momma I’m tired of crying, just lie to me one more time"

[Hook]
Cause it’s crunch time
Cause it’s crunch time
Shit real man
A nigga got bills man it’s crunch time

Shit real man a nigga got bills

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Look, scavenge these records of these days MP3’s
Looking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV’s
This is for nigga’s with empty dreams and empty jeans
Still holding on to the word maybe
Cause this 9 to 5 shit is driving you stir crazy
Coming home tired just to hear it from your lady
Hollering about your baby, need this and need that
And all you want is peace and quiet
Maybe some feedback, on these raps
Cause labels ain’t hollering, and niggas ain't downloading
Nobody see your vision, they walking around blindfolded
All this time holding on to possibilities
You step outside, you smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze
Fuck what they talking, it ain’t like life come often
Only thing worse than death is a regret filled coffin
So try before you die or always wonder what if?
I thank the lord for this wonderful gift
Looking for strength in this crunch time

[Hook]
Looking for strength in the crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg
It’s crunch time, yeah nigga it’s crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg

[Outro: J. Cole]
I feel your pain nigga trust me
For all my nigga’s out there still trying to get it
Few nigga’s I know, few nigga’s I don’t know

Shout out to my nigga FilthE
Nervous Reck
Shout out to Marcus
My nigga I forgive you for all that shit you said
I understand my nigga
Still love. Yeah



[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no X-Ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my people die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 3]
Forget this chain, cause this ain't me
Though I'm eternally grateful to Jay Z
We so elated, we celebrated like Obama waited until his last day in office to tell the nation, brothers is getting their reparations, hey
A man can dream, can't he?
No disrespect, in terms of change I haven't seen any
Maybe he had good intentions but was stifled by the system
And was sad to learn that he actually couldn't bring any
That's what I get for thinking, this world is fair
They let a brother steer the ship
And never told him that the ship was sinkin'
But I got other shit to think about, like my bank account
Forget that watch, you paid too much for it
You 'ought to be ashamed
When brothers back home be dreading when the seasons change
Cause they ain't got no heat and they ain't got no AC
WalMart distribution fired my homie, he just had a baby
You wonder why it's been so many B and E's lately
While brothers from the hood shooting like this is TNT lately
And since all the ballers leaving college early
I turn on the TV and don't see no brothers with degrees lately

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Outro]
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off...



[Produced by J. Cole]

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Ahem, yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Now, I was dreamin' 'bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiendin' for the mills, I ain't talking Burger Kings
Some of my niggas in the Ville, all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spend their time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up, now, don’t get it twisted, I ain't hating, do your thing
I was like a young Simba—couldn’t wait to be the King
Now, nigga, it’s the Prince
Hopped over the fence, where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass; way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Miss Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now it's time to eat, I’m letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me now they acting like they know me

[Refrain]
“Where you goin’ nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no tellin’
Huh, yeah
“Aye, where you goin’ nigga?”, aye
It ain't no tellin’, yeah
They keep on sayin’, “where you goin’ nigga?” (Goin’ nigga), aye
It ain't no tellin’, yeah
Can’t tell you where I’m goin’, know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the—top
Uh

[Verse 2]
Pardon the interruption;
A proper introduction is necessary when your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn’t let me in the cafeteria
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians; they looking me up
She got to jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning, "J. Cole," they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin, six feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dollar and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please, let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I’m a star; Converses
Conversin' with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains because my shit is unheard of
Like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me, though
Now, they yellin'—

[Refrain]
“Where you goin’ nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no tellin’
Huh, yeah
“Aye, where you goin’ nigga?”, aye
It ain't no tellin’, yeah
They keep on sayin’, “where you goin’ nigga?” (Goin’ nigga), aye
It ain't no tellin’, yeah
Can’t tell you where I’m goin’, know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the—top
Uh

[Verse 3]
I left the city for a minute but it's still on my back
Told my niggas, "Aye I'm finna put the Ville on the map
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque"
'Cause I'm ill, bitch, they couldn’t make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send em back
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap
Hold up, now, don’t get it twisted, if you slang, do your thang
Me, I'm like a young Simba—I can't wait to be the King
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballers
Ain't no fathers but the skinny niggas tryna hit their daughters
Sneaking in her crib but her momma never caught us
What they taught us, man—them bad bitches only want the ballers
The starters, we hooping, now, the hoes wanna guard us
Okay, so play D, know what I mean?
And I, I, I put you on the team
Man, this life is but a dream
And I need a fast car, bad broads
Fast forward; passport, I'm a fuckin' rap star

[Refrain]
“Aye, where you goin’ nigga?”
Shit, it ain't no tellin’
Yeah
They say this life is but a dream, well, I need a fast car, bad broads
Fast forward; passport, I'm a fuckin’ rap star
“Aye, where you goin’ nigga?”
Yeah
It ain't no tellin’



[Verse]
Hey, to the college kids, no scholarships
Starting your semester
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it’s God bless ya
Life is your professor, know that bitch is gon' test ya
I got some shit I’d like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
And can I spit out my stress?
It’s the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic
He said Cole, “A lil' birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic”
Nobody touching Nas nigga it’s more like Villematic
These Fayettenam tales be paying off well
What story is my audio theater gon' tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon' sell?
I guess it’s in God’s hands
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn
That's for your non-believers
I’m the truth only time will teach ya
And fuck the haters probably never love they mommas neither
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes
With computers on hating on the newest song
While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans
Trying to do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on
Name a fucking song I ain't threw up on
Talk is cheap, its like y'all grew up in a Jewish home!
Pardon the stereotype
But y'all giving me mixed feelings like I married a white woman
One minute I’m overrated, next minute I’m the savior
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
For bullshitting and that nigga Cole spitting that real
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
To Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
Cause now I’m dealing with money I’ve never seen before
And R&B bitches want me, that was just dreams before
Now do I give into the temptation I’m facing
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasing
But I’m just a man, at time’s the timing is wrong
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it’s own
But I’m trying to be strong, remind myself she ain’t about shit
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
Looking for cheese on some mouse shit
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, then go run they mouth quick
Rappers took a vacation I came over to house sit
You want change, this that between the seats in your couch shit
The fuck you thought, I lost it
All that flame on my name would get exhausted
Au contraire my nigga they all ears
Sit back, enjoy the ride it’s finna be a long year, yeah
It’s finna be a long year, yeah

[Outro]
I know you feel that, the tingle in your spine don’t conceal that
Don’t conceal that
This exactly what you thought
Somebody bought the real back



[Sample: Janelle Monáe]
May this song reach your heart

[Refrain: J.Cole]
Hey one time, hey one time

Throw your hands to the sky tonight
Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right
And girl you damn right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
Cause baby
You got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it)

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Hey Cole World, real cold world
I watch it hit the floor and watch it drop it real low girl
Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl
I had a crush now we grown and we still so thorough
Clap for her, work it till you exhausted
I swear nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn your ex-man is a dumb ass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight
Was he stressing you, wasn’t fucking you right
Well one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure
One damn thing you can’t change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together
It’s whatever, you shine, I shine
I know you got a 9-5 I’ll be your 5-9

[Refrain]
Hey one time, hey one time
One time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Yeah, go ahead and pop it like you do in the mirror
I’m picking through the crowd tryna see a little clearer
High heel wearer, hell of a body
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody
Nope, I’m peeking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I dont bag I’ll be thinking bout your ass
For the whole week, no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine I'm gon' speak
I tell her my name Jermaine
I’m tryna be low key
She tell me I got that flame, your rhymes are so deep
Man, girl thank you
Shit you so bad know your daddy wish he could still spank you
Hold up for these other niggas roll up and try and get ya
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya
I’m tryna vibe with ya so won't you throw me your phone number
And let them lames get your old number

[Refrain]
Hey one time, hey one time
One time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right

[Verse 3: Wale]
Roc Nation, Wale
Look, Cole world, still a cold world
And a couple you is cool but we a little more thorough
Whole time, a little more girls
You know I spit that sick shit and there’s still no cure
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther
Love my women with high heels and high standards
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat
I ain't superstitious I make all these broads split my pole
You dig it, this shit ain't for beginners
I’m something like a fetus, I'm not quite kidding
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block your vision
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop
Hundred K in twenty-two hours
See money talks, you muthafuckers is Boomhauer
No check back, in debt yep
Loud in my jay, y'all smoke that Gallaudet
Higher than I need to be
Flyer cause I need to be
Love our conversation but it’s late right now
I need to beat
One time for the Ville that Cole rep
Another time for the city of slow death
I dont understand why these niggas so vexed
I dont need no chains with no cross to know that I’m blessed

[Refrain]
Hey one time, hey one time
One time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right
And girl you damn right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night

[Sample: Janelle Monáe]
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart



[Verse 1]
Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hoping this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell them "go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let them OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it

[Hook]
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip, don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on
Don't lose your balance
Don't lose your balance

[Verse 2]
I look around at my city this is SinVille
That boy 11 years old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm bout to lose it I just had another friend killed
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul I asked it "When will, this shit change? "
It said boy "Just use them pen skills"-
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you cause you my brother so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh

[Hook]
Yeah, and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance
Don't slip don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
Don't lose your balance
Don't lose your balance

[Verse 3]
I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'mma sucka for love I guess
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame em' did the same when I saw the ass
Match with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensai
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped

[Hook]
I think I'm losing my balance, yea uh
I think I'm losing my balance, yea uh
She got me Losing your balance
She got me Losing your balance uh, yea
But I won't slip, I won't fall
Just a get a grip and hold on
Losing my balance
Losing my balance



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Higher, higher
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Revenge)

[Verse]
Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat Turner in my past life
Bob Marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
Who survived against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
Who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago, the game snatch a nigga’s spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
First thing they do is throw their shade
Word?—errr—I swerve like a Thunderbird on the curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scriptures
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive
Back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "Hello", just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil
You can tell him Cole just sent you now

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah—higher, higher
Yeah, yeah—higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
I can come around, shit, whenever you want
I can come around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
Me, me, me, me, me, me
(Revenge)



[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one

[Verse 1]
Hey, uh
What up girl, tell me how you feelin’
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in
She said looks kill and I’m tryin to make a killin’
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami, with a super ho team
Tryin’ to bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name
Somethin’ like James, somethin like Wade
If you something like paid you can fuck tonight
Yeah she said fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings, won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money man the head is amazing

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one

[Verse 2]
What up girl, tell me how you been
Ain’t seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then
Thought you was a cutie, though your booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga, god damn
Hey now got a thing for you
It's been a long time comin', I should hang with you
'Cause see way back, I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy’s now, 2 and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah you still got it though
Girl your body lookin’ like a fuckin’ pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl you're on a roll
Do you get brains, did you make the honor roll
Don’t worry bout your man baby, he ain’t gotta know

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one, hey

[Verse 3]
Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phoney, yeah only 'cause I can give you ends
Too late for turning back, fuck it we continuing
Get your ass in that position, I love to bend you in

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one



[Verse]
Yeah, grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega Man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, a real black queen
If I had a genie, I'd wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house this shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know this shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying "Get off me!"
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only twelve
I wish I wouldla bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared a nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, ayo genie last wish, free my nigga



[Verse 1]
These niggas is playing Russian roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless no we don't dance all we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted
Heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high if I dropped I would fall for eleven minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text-us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress
I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow
Or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2]
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be Lebron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, Aye is it destiny or is it money your feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they trynna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it

[Pre-Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled)  & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me



[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, school girl, cool girl
You dressing sexy and your mama is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folks thing
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool girl
You got your new hair, it look so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him 'round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it?
It's cause your mind don't match what your ass got
But cheer up, you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're lookin' for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter, you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking...

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come up to some when they try push up
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the Glock to my head, feel I rather be dead
Hey, am I hopeless? Raised with rats and roaches
Never liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask "what's the matter?" but you can't relate
Living the life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I’m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother, yeah I love her
But things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer
Dark in my heart and I don't know if I’ll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She said she proud of me and I wonder what for?
And once more

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come up to some when they try push up
Hey, hey



[Hook]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 1]
Hey I came up
I warmed up the next up
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Now don’t it sound legendary
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing and bitch I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say: "What you fighting for? The game is on life support"
And Gary Coleman just passed: life is short

Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah got to the club early just to get in free
And wait for hoes to show up
But now its bottles at them tables, bring the models boy
I’m about to po’ up
Uh ha, you know what
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Left side, left side
Right side, right side
Left side, left side, hey!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Momma said I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever
Ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go
Hit the club she drop it low
Lower than my credit score
Account overdraft what I got this debit for
So much debt it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle
You border like Mexico
Hey baby girl what it look like
And where ya head at
And what ya cook like
She said where ya bread at
And what your whip like
You ain't got one or the other well brother good night

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles
You mean to tell me everything gon be fine
If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fucking matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you could blow up
And maybe you could blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up



[Intro]
Just turn the beat down just a little bit

[Verse 1]
They say anythings possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can ho
They try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas ass no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Simply had to approach, "what's up young blood?"
Ain't it strange, a year ago today, my nigga, I was counting change
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city
Though I gotta thank God, cause if you weren’t with me
Then I surely woulda died, you can throw the fork in me
This my New Years resolution, dawg
No more Pork in me, uh, I ain't no Muslim though
Caron Butler I’m a wizard if he doesn't know
Its young Simba, I’m ballin’ 'til the buzzer blow
You try and kick the shit I kick you gon stub your toe
Boy thats just how tough I go, see this is my life work
This shit you callin' classic, I be like that might work
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dyke work
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst

[Bridge 1]
Not tonight nigga
Not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Hey, man, hey

[Verse 2]
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma, momma who don’t like me
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me
I hit her til she snooze, like the news nigga nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
No she bitter with this nigga cause he ain't quite me
One things for certain baby, you are a wifey, two things for fucking sure
I am not the husband though, so run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah thats a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interupt something real, damn
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn’t say that you a ho, just made a ho decision
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions
We both know thats what you wanted girl
I know you listening

Hey
Girl I know you listening
Uh I know you listening
Hey, yeah

[Verse 3]
Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online trying to find my shit
And to the niggas listening but won't buy my shit
And catch me in the street wanna ride my dick
Y’all niggas is the worst, see me like
“J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD”
Nigga please, an album ten dollars
You act like it’s ten g’s
This food for thought cost the same as 2 numbers three’s
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel ya pain, thats why I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh shit
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and a whole lot more shit
Than got richer and still rapping like I’m poor shit
You niggas think you know shit, nigga you don’t know shit
Ho bitch
Yeah, Cole Bitch
J Cole nigga
Hey



[Verse 1]
Tears for ODB, drug-induced poetry
What’s the use? Strung-out from that drug abuse, woe is me
80's baby, so I know my pops was gettin’ high
In the 90's, me and mama barely gettin’ by
2000's I was concentratin’ more on gettin’ fly
Gettin’ bitches, gettin’ rich to get the shit I couldn’t buy
You know the story, you know my allegory
I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they’d better warn y’all
I’m here for more than just to kick some witty metaphors, dawg
This more of the type of shit you spit to set a war off
‘Cause niggas be poor, get money and still don’t know
Why the fuck they can’t cop a house, the system meant to lock us out
But I’m knockin’ down the door, strapped up with a four-four
Robin Hood, shit and yeah, I’m ‘hood rich
That’s good enough to stay in new kicks and a good whip
Get good head from a good bitch, I give two shits, I’mma tell you straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch

[Verse 2]
Lord have mercy on my soul, what I’ve done and what I’ve seen
My life has tumbled into that which only you could intervene
I put my heart in senseless things: money, bitches and street shit
Fascinated by beef, sad to say I won’t be shit
Grew up in this bitch without a pot to piss in, no toilet
How ironic, I took a lot of shit, like a bottom bitch
Or a model chick, high off coke
They lockin’ sons up for less, I don’t care how y’all cope
But yet I still peddle this dope and these pills
I’ll never know how sittin’ comfy on that Oprah seat feels
More than likely be on Most Wanted posters, we still
Holdin’ on to old dreams of bein’ Hova, be real
We the forgotten souls, bottom of the totem poles
Left for dead, some niggas fled, people said they sold their souls
I just think they found a better way, Lord knows I never pray
But sometimes I be wishin’ I could levitate, I’ll take it straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch

[Outro]



[Verse 1]
You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I skate town, catch a Greyhound
Change my name right, catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know they’ll lock me if I stay
But where I’mma run to
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and yet I’d love to
But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to
Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you
That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay

[Hook]
Stay

[Verse 2]
Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step
I’m gettin’ grown now
And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes around
Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay
Although I love it here
I’ll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother here
Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that
Let’s show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay

[Hook]



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, caged bird
Something like a caged bird
Caged bird
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You ain't a man till you stop chasing your friends, my nigga
Think for yourself, make your own plans, my nigga
I'll be lying if I said I ain't understand, my nigga
Cause who you gon' follow when the leaders all get swallowed
By reefer clouds and bottles
In and out of county jail
This is hell, see the young black males in packed cells
With they heads down
And they fists clenched tight
Thinking "I could bust a hole through this wall
And bitch I just might"
It's just like the caged bird I sing a song
Hoping they open up these bars and send a nigga home
I cry when I'm alone
I'm wondering why would God send me here
Knowing that they hate us
Knowing that they make us feel like we evil so we kill our people
Without a second thought, in every lesson taught by OGs
We full of real nigga wisdom, so we proceed
Like real niggas who been stripped of our humanity
I see the judge's eyes, I know that he ain't understanding me

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage

[Verse 2: Omen]
Well, it's the oratory vet
Turned down king slash poet laureate
Used to paint a picture with a story of neglect
I could've been a shorty drinking 40s on the steps
With a shorty on my lap
With a shorty on the way coming shortly to protect
I could've been a dealer in the party with the X
But I'm hardly in the mix and I partially confess
I definitely got a couple parts in me that I regret
Is the cup half-empty or is it half-full?
I fill mine up with Hennessy, then get back to him
I'm just a jazz musician trapped in a rap form
You think you standing for something you on a trap door
Well it's the, Mr. Introspective
I'm a dreamers dream, a sort of an inception
I never fiend for the scene but I dreamed of the things
That a Mercedes brings, like slow sex with fast women
Drinking cognac I'm past grinning
A sexy dress, fat ass in it
But still hit it till I'm half-winded
Cause niggas tell me I'm the shit when I be hitting all these dimes
See I'm caged by the visions of the blind
I started as a king
Turned to a slave
Put us in our chains
We was forced to entertain
Thinking bout the present day I'm living off the stage
Wonder if a nigga ever get up out this cage
As I sing

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage



[Verse 1]
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could, said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first little taste of paper
And I splurged, I guess it's just the nigga urge
This is The Boondocks
I swear yo I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be trynna save the world, then on Friday I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting
Damn, hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see I can, but I won’t, cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat, on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes I let her give me head
So she won't remember where I live - my game is tight
Baby no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it “Can I Live?”
Aye dear Lord, “Can I live?”
Now am I living to get paid just slaves for a wage, are we
I can't do no 9-to-5 told my momma “sorry”
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, naw couldn’t give a shit hardly
I be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me
If I go I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know the fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow so they was waiting on me

[Hook]
But Oh-No, Lord
See I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?

Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be God damn, If I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'mma make it to the top
So I'mma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop

[Verse 2]
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!!”
Took off his shirt trynna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know
Did I tell my baby sorry from before
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?



[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 1]
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’mma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit remember I was straying from home
And "Where I Wanna Be" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone

[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 2]
She know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don’t mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy don’t please my ass
If shit was on the other foot then you would leave my ass
Ay, True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal and you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try justify thinkin', man we finna be rich
While some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks

[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me

She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Intro]
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
Look, some niggas let their dirt out
Some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade; a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint?
Glorify me, over-think? Say they know me, say I’m great?
Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated
Just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man

[Hook]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now Im blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a pre-nup
Think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
Its hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing

[Hook]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the morning
Hoes blowin' up my phone
I ain't used to small talkin, when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em
I'll holla later, man
Right now my mind elsewhere
My Mom's healthcare, get'n out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail
Frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'd worry bout my welfare
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight
I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up
Look out the window hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out
They locking up some older head
So Goddamn homey, hold your head
And hold your head

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'mma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change
Still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle
Ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics
As I sip

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'ma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way

[Verse 3]
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin'
I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin' this shit one step at a time
That real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'mma find a way
Cause hey
Damn it them jobs out there ain't tryna pay
I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up
And show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'ma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'ma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
See your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
What she do, double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how man dogging me
My best friend say, dont tell her nothing bout me
Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy
My best say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I’ll be there, I’ll still be there for you

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me
We breaking up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, than you start listening
To friends, and then it, gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

[Bridge]
My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling , let me know whats on your mind
We’ve been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I’m never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey



[Produced by Jermaine Cole & Omen]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin'
At least not with us
Might see em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilo’s
Dodgin them people
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes he touch her daughter how the boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher and though I never met ya
I'm thinkin' God bless ya, the city try and get ya

[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you bet your Momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screamin' we miss you
(we miss ya)

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yea, lets see God
I know you only do whats best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery
My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m trying to get clear, I’m tryna quit fear
Who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smoke screen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but there’s no kings

[Hook: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they tryna kill ya
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that its God’s will, I’m asking God will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain, momma smokin' cocaine as it rains out
Am I to blame? Try to stay sane so I came outside
Where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boy's brains out
But will it change, its like niggas is free but our minds still in the chains
Brothers killing each other, the blood spill its a shame
Will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
Don’t even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the whole season nigga no re-runs
The devil buying souls nigga no refunds

[Bridge]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya

[Outro]
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong
'Cause ain't nothing wrong
Im not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass
I gotta ball
I gotta ball
I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball



[Kerney Thomas]
I'm just thankful 18 years of suffering gone just like that
You've been suffering 18 years yourself
You've been going through pure hell but it can be over just that fast
This is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens of thousands across the country
That were hurting for God to heal them
And God could work a miracle for them
All you gotta do is either log on to our website
Or you can dial the toll-free number
And place your order right there
For the Personal Prayer Package
I want you quickly, to place that order right now
For the Personal Prayer Package
Pick up the telephone right now
I said pick up the phone right now
You're past due a miracle



[Hook]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
'Ey to you it don't matter cause you still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you're still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the life of a, nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I'm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I'm fly, I'm a Wright Brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that you could cut and never worry 'bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorized her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her
Y'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don't be appalled man, that nigga was a dog
So it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do that make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 2]
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it's time to hit the real world, filled with all them résumés and applications
Man, but ain't nobody calling you back
You say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the world on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
'Ey has this world got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had the brake on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, it's just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ain't changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you you'll get the same me

[Hook] + [Post-Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just like a star that's in my sky
Just like an angel off my page
You have appeard to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and it's been, way too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Hey, uh, still I wonder why
But it ain't what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goin' out my mind
Man, damn

[Hook]

Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star

[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself If I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell oh-well sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
Cuz plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top! You watching me nigga? Then Hold It Down

[Hook]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down

[Verse 2]
You were my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? yo, she still the baddest!
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down!

[Hook]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down

[Verse 3]
And these are tough times baby but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A women with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know im down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me

[Hook]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down



[Hook]
Rise above, rise above
And you’ve got to
Rise above, rise above

[Verse 1]
She had a little daughter with her, it was cold out
She said “ah, I hate this motherfucker,” then she rolled out
He ain’t answering his phone, she yells “what the fuck?!”
Then told her daughter “buckle up, yeah, that’s for safety”
See she been stressin’ lately
‘Cause this nigga she done been with for the past two years
Is now the current reason for her last few tears
She text, he don’t text back
When she see him she be tryna sex, he don’t sex back
His heart be on jet black
She call, he don’t call back, all he say is “fall back”
A nigga just need his space, so she headed to his place
Cause she just got a call from her homegirl Rhonda
Who said he been creepin’, he been fuckin’ with Yolanda
“Yolanda? Yeah girl, Yolanda”
“Told you he ain’t shit but you ain’t listen, I was tryna” –
“Click” – hmmm, hung up that phone and hopped right up in that Honda
Headed to his crib, she said she fed up with this shit
“Thought this time this was the one, thought I got better at this shit”
“Pickin’ out Mr. Right, stick it out through the fights”
“And long nights, for what? These niggas is all alike”
She gon’ set it off, her daughter gon’ witness it all tonight, damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition
Now she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference
Aye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they don’t listen
A ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?
I’m fuckin’ with you, but for real, she say they hopeless
A class full of jokesters, creating all the obstacles, impossible to focus
Little niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need
And they don’t even try, one little boy, he caught her eye
‘Cause he look just like her brother, she be havin’ to call his mother
But she act like she don’t care – what father? He ain’t here
Now she frustrated, thinkin’ that she just made the mistake of her life
Underpaid, be havin’ to waitress at night
Six years of college down the drain, drinkin’, tryna drown her pain
Party with her girls, feeling sorry for the world
‘Cause ain’t no hope for the youth, well ain’t that the truth
When all your role models either rappin’ or they hoop, damn

[Hook]

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Yea, keep following me, keep calling me
Yea, yea, yea

Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed
The beauty of life, the pain never lasts
The rain always past, the sun don’t always shine
When its gone I'm lonely, but when its there Im fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think Im a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
Its funny, 100 years ago I woulda called this nigga master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say Im easily distracted I think the problem is Im easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following

[Verse 2: Omen]
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard
Nights with no progress
Mane im thinking like I'll probably find a Loch Ness
In the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping Im reaching for closeness

Feel like the devil keep following me
Feel like the devil keep following me



[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring him 'round cause her homegirls’ll clown like
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bite size"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about her 5 year plan
She saying “who I’m fooling, they could never understand”
They could never understand

[Hook: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I’m watching CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep ‘em niggas walking 'round blind all the time
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The single's only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparel
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of all the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates is a nigga fate
And why they call this shit a race
The agony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Hook]

[Bridge: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me

[Outro: 2Pac]
Don't support the Phoneys,Support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talkin about how they so real
And they don't care about our communities?
How can they be talkin about how they're all this you know
The hood and blah blah they don't care about the communities?
You know what I mean? Listen to the words they have in their lyrics
And tell me is that some real shit
And if that's real shit to you
You know what I mean? Listen to what they're saying to you
Don't just bob your head to the beat peep the game
And listen to what I'm saying & hold us accountable for it



[Verse 1]
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left y'all browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say it's an arousing point of view
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shed truth
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ain't make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prision
You can tell I'm living, right?
Never said I'm living right

[Bridge: Cee-Lo sample]
I'm a fool
Such a fool
For you

[Hook: Cole]
And they like
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
And they like
And they like
And they like
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
And they like
And they like

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
The first to go to college, they say knowledge is a tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard, I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but I'm sad to say it
I ain't learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it
I'm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts, I don't bruise, so fuck y'all reviews
She told me "Cole, I love you rode with you way before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches
And calling brothas niggas, pardon if I cross a line
But all this time knew you was different than all them other niggas"
I responded to her "please don't put me on a pedestal
Cuz I know better and I'm still a fool"

[Bridge] + [Hook]



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey
Fayettenam, yeah, bitch

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I'm sippin' liquor for the pain, pourin' liquor for the slain
Nothin' else can do the trick, like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind tryna figure where this 20 g's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought, I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Countin' days, still waitin' on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful, want it all so quick, feel a vibrate
Hold up, I got a call, old bitch, how she get my new shit
Swear the city too small
Type of chick won't take her shirt off cause her titties too small
I could give a damn girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep-seaing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard, Lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love wit that
At the door wit a towel on and nothin' under that
Sayin' welcome

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
I let these words flow out like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowd
Cause these words go deep from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hit the souls of all those that I've reached
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane
Man, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends
With the marijuana wonder will this high ever end
Swear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome?
I tell 'em ain't nothin' wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own

[Outro: J. Cole]
Yeah, I deal with it on my own nigga
Welcome



[Sample]

[Intro]
Yeah, hey
Fayettenam nigga
Dreamville nigga
J. Cole
Hey, ah
I ain't ready yet
Yeah, I ain't ready yet
Yeah, hey

[Verse 1]
Gettin' higher than the soul of little Shaniya
And to the ones that killed her, hope you burn in fire
I’m burnin' tires on the strip, tryna get a grip
Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip
6 shots of Hennessey, I’m still goin' strong
Please numb me from the bullshit that’s goin' on
That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered
And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of
You fuckin' coward, ain’t gotta tell em’ go to Hell
'Cause that’s the shit that make them other niggas sick in jail;
So you gon’ feel it
Travel the world reppin' this city, know I’m gon' kill it
But yet a nigga ain’t got a clue..
How I’m gon' deal with all the bullshit
Niggas sendin' shots my way
You put a hit out on me, think that I’m gon' stop? No way
Gon' have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin' so filthy
Young, black, and wealthy, nigga for that I’m guilty
Still see all the fake shit, it’s funny somehow
Thought the money could erase it, no matter how
Much dough you got you gotta face it, and to my niggas gone
Hope you in a better place, if I make it I’ll holla…

[Hook]
See world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good

[Verse 2]
Uh, I got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget
The industry overlook me, for that I be holding grudges
Wouldn’t take a chance on me, suddenly it's, oh you love it
Let's get a Cole feature, that's gon' put you over budget, now
Picture being broke with no pot to piss in
And then suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like God to me, slowly losing my religion
As these notes from my composition turn to compositions, then
Put it out and hope the world sing
We sippin’ liquor for the pain that the world bring
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole
Just to find out that out heroes were some assholes, y’all don't hear me
Maybe I had the world figured out wrong
When these niggas go from singing our songs and waiting on you
'Bout a year later the same ones be hatin’ on you
Every other record these rappers be faking on you
Dog, we sing your songs but we know that ain’t you
We know you gotta make the people pay you
'Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you
And be that broke muthafucker talkin' 'bout “I stayed true”

[Hook]
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good

[Sample]

[Hook]
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good

[Verse 1]
Hey, this is the story of a young’n dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin’
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you’ve been gone
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diploma
Damn, gon’ be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

[Hook]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I’m following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it’s me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don’t know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don’t give it up in the meantime

[Hook]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A’s
Hey if you’re listening we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z ay what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Straight out The Ville and I made it
Like a villain I'm hated
I see'em grillin, I ate it though
Finna blow inflatable, That's undebatable (ugh)
I'm givin niggas food for thought, the flow is catered yo
I'm never faded though
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the dough related ho!
It's like my only son, where I go, he come!
Niggas dumb to be braggin bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin like the light-skin version
Of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised
That's word to everything!
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin
You sucka niggas lie in everything that ya sayin
Shame on ya'll, you tryna ball with the game on pause
A nigga pull the thing on ya'll, ya'll stain ya'll draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on ya'll
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale, I excel in this rap shit
Cause ya'll spittin that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats that made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin for the freaks and the dimes and I shine like a mothafuckin diamond
You shine like a mothafuckin dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate
I grew up with nothin, it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huxtable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzle for
Look how the buzz will grow
Ballin til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin funny, fuck a joke
I'm gettin money til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba!
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga: young simba!



[Intro (Sampled): Billie Holiday (J. Cole)]
What can I do?
It’s cost me a lot
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
(Shit homie) It’s cost me a lot (Shit homie)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y’all can see I’m ballin’, HD

[Refrain]
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that

[Verse 2]
Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word

[Refrain]



Whats love got to do, got to do with it?
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it

(How high?)

Whats love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it

[J. Cole - Verse 1]
Visionary play your position, no missionary
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope
Now picture that
My poetry’s deep now fish for that
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail
Shit you gotta feel like it’s only read in braille
Both did the crime but his homie didn’t tell
So he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell
Thinking well, what the hell I been on
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on
By the time I’m back in the streets like a bachelor
I gotta play the clubs with the old ass woman
Life is a movie, pick your own role
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole
You sit around crying thats like sitting round dying
You wanna touch the sky bitch you figure out flying

[Hook]
Nigga how high? so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[J. Cole - Verse 2]
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels
Tryna get a nut with your girl
Think I need to quit trying ‘fore some nigga out there try to hit mine
Karma for the Kama Sutra
A lot calmer when the ganja’s through ya
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda
For stashing that marijuana
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed
I broke the law but look I’ll never smoke or steal again
In your courtroom wylin’, I don’t mean to keep smiling
But right now I’m high enough to probably steal a plane
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn’t read?
Would you throw the book at me
What if I’m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy
It’s been a long time coming
Tell my nigga roll me up something

[Hook]

[J. Cole ]
No I dont smoke, maybe once in a blue
When the tension gets thick then there’s nothing to do
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind
My eyes get shut but I open my mind

How high? la la la la
How high? hey hey hey
How high? yeah yeah yeah yeah
How high? la la la la

Is that a shot that you threw little man?
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned
Make it worse, your friends, now when they talk rap
All you hear is “J Cole this” and “J Cole that”
It must be hard for your pride just to take all that
I know your weak heart gotta break off that
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear
I’m burning you niggas and I’m only in first gear
I’m serving you niggas this is only the first beer
12 months from now, you’ll be having the worst year
No tears for the haters, I’m still counting money
Cole ain't dropping, thats real fucking funny
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps
Something like a mummy
But I’mma wake yo’ ass up
Something like your mommy on school day
I smoke two l’s with ya girl this is Cool J

How high?
How high?
How high? yeah
How high? yeah

Whats love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Yeah I send it right back to you with it



[Verse 1]
Ay, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that, a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spitting
This that pulpit, I’m hitting niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of sifting through my mail I feel like Cartwright, bills
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talking man I know how niggas feel

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse 2]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump
They shooting niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up!
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinking that I’m slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'mma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse 3]
Check it
Ay Sallie, I know I ain't been answering your calls
But shit, let me explain- it's because times been hard
Been running around trying find a job
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore
I still got your letters laying in my dresser drawer
You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gonna pay you back”
I got a dollar and a dream



[Verse 1]
Yeah, It's Cole, won't lie, won't stop 'til the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are
Usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina, where I made it from
Cole world, no blanket, son
Girls fast how Jamaicans run
Puffing on the city where the Lakers from: L-A, L-A, la la
So high, everything is a “ha ha” for me
Dreaming of the days of a drop 500
And a bad bitch that'll go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry
If you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mind wondering now, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not, hope not, hope not, hope not

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Yeah, just trying to make it, my nigga
(My world is empty without you)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
A wise nigga told me don’t chase that cash
Follow your heart, you’ll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass
Or does she wish to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face, just gassed
Like “baby girl, why you take this path?”
Stack in his hand, trynna make that last
All she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub titties in his face and laugh
Gotta try not to look fake, in fact
A little more money, like a few more 20’s
When you let that nigga grab your naked ass
Okay, he’s gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear
“This ain't the life for you, baby, let me take you out of here cause..."

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Yeah, she like "nigga, yeah right"
(My world is empty without you)
"You know how much motherfucking money I'm making?"

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my niggas sit back, blowing the L
Only getting high cause we closer to hell
Nigga trying to live like Hova, but well
We broke and that dough coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard in the snow, in the hail
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells
My mom broke, but she posted the bail
Someway, somehow
Nigga feeling like the sun down even when the sun up
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trying to raise her son up
'Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor couldn’t give one fuck
While she singing

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Damn, told you niggas "Cole world, no blanket"
(My world is empty without you)
Tough luck, yeah

Where's Jermaine Cole?
He does this all the time...



[Verse 1]
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job
Don’t mean to disrespect you
But we’ve been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby yeah if you only knew
I got bigger problems baby, yeah
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn’t know man
It don’t mean nothing to me
Cause right now I got my little boy crying
And my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me
Listen here, I ain't looking for no tears
But my brother got a year
And my Momma keep smoking that shit
On top of that, I’m broke
Please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then ahana...

[Verse 2]
Hey
Dear, Mr. Policeman
Ay am I wrong, ain't you suppose to keep the peace man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me fo'?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it
Or cause I’m Black, hmmm maybe?
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won’t hear a sound
Man I’m nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see
Thug niggas, drug dealers, it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip gotta motherfucking college degree
And then ahana... unh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my middle finger to the law
Busting off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said impossible but I’mma fucking try
Plus how he gon’ tell me, he don't make the rules
There’s niggas dying every day but we don’t make the news
Instead they talking bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story, Tiger Woods be fucking all these White hoes
Anchorman stop snitching
Cut to commercial, he be texting all the side bitches
Hey my goodness
How ironic
On trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than a comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding
How you sit above me
Are you perfect motherfucker
How you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day you niggas just like us



[Intro]
Naw, I'm just saying like, I'm just trynna see you, you know what I'm saying? What you was doing after this
Naw, I stay not too far from here, like right down the street-yea like right there

[Verse 1]
Baby you summertime fine, I'll let you get on top
I'll be the underline I'm-trynna get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason only time could tell, but well
I'm wondering what type of shit you on
Do you like the finer things or are you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed?
Done be ashamed, it ain't no thang, I used to blow trees
Getting lifted
I quit the shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower you, a powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibes
Like you threw something to me-so I threw em back
Now all my niggas hollering "who is that?
Oh boy she bad nigga, what you bout to do with that?"
I'm finna take you home sip a little Patron now we zoning
Baby you so fine

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 2]
Yea, yea now are you shy or is you freaky lady?
Are you shallow cause if not I'll take it deeper baby
Tell me what turns you on
You like the slow songs?
You like some candles lite?
That ain't really my style
But see I planned a trip
And yea we both coming
Just tell me how you want it
I give it to you like I owe you something
When I'm on it, on it like my job
I'm hoping I confess
This life gets hard I can take away your stress if you let me
You knew just what this was when you met me
So let your guard down girl
I'll take your bra down girl and undress ya
Real slow yea I'll make you feel special
I can feel your heart beating fast
From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab
And now ya leaking, freaking ain't no speaking but you moaning!
Ya so fine I got to give it to you

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 3]
I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning
Do you like caressing or do you like aggression?
You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows
Do you want it in the dark or while the lights is still on?
I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel
While we sweating you dripping wet from what your body spill
Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go
See baby lately seems my life been hell and heaven knows
That you looking like an angel-sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle
Got a nigga tangle in your spider web
I'm doing shit I never might of did
And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red
Your body's right as rain
So where the hydroplane
That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame
Thank God I found you
Just holla when you want it
Cause girl your so thorough



Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Yeah hey

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, Big dreams
Nice night or So it seems
Stroll in the club with her tight fit jeans
Praying that she might get seen by a nigga with a contract
With a sports team or just a nigga that you figure could afford things
Like more rings for her fingers
She used to fuck singers but said they too soft, Just copped a new loft
For you walk into her crib got to take her shoes off
Thats only step one your dress is next hun
You say your kid sleep, I don't want no step son
But lead the way to your bed room, king size bed so we got leg room
She give Queen like head so we got head room, my God
Than I work her like its my job
Her moans is like music to my ears iPod

And than I hit the door, cause baby I got to go
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know
I know you've been through this before

[Hook]
Check it, I make the rich bitch beg
Make the good girl steal
Make the old ladies blush
Make the young hoes squeal
For real, for real

[Verse 2]
Good girl huh, father was a preacher
Sent her off to college thought he got her on a leash though
From the outside man them girls be the squeakiest
You get 'em inside them girls be the freakiest

Mischievous, downright devious
Say she want cake I got all the right ingredients
Running round fronting like a pure white virgin
Gave a nigga dome while her father gave a Sermon
Amen, let the choir sing
She be walking round campus like the quiet thing
Some niggas scared to approach when they admiring
Man if they know like I know she got that fire thing
Pour a little OJ with some P-trone
I'm feeling ok, but homie she's gone
When remmy Rev called she just ignore him
I had her calling on God 'til the wee morn
And than I hit the door nigga

Cause baby I got to go
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know
I know you've been through this before

[Hook]

[Intro: J. Cole]
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)
You know who this is dedicated to

[Hook: J. Cole] (X2)
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 1: Bas]
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?
Bitch, I don't care
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Got a bitch like a diamond
Bitch got no flaws
See the switch when she walk
Give the bitch an applause
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want
Fly to another continent if I want
Ride through the projects if I want
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, TDK, TDK
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite
I don't talk much, but I say a lot
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot
When we sweating in the dark don't run
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run
She a square but that ass rotund
She let me cut samurai shogun
Know you heard bout the backstroke
I can make your perm turn to an afro
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches
Nice girls, classy women
I'm too official
Dreamville, nigga too official
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch

[Hook] (X2)



[Intro]
La-la-la-laaaa, la lala la lalaaaa

[Hook]
Now I am (Here's to the Roc')
Hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
(Here's to Roc-a-Fella) It's the Fayettenam
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc')
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the Warm Up

[Verse 1]
Now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am

[Hook]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Verse 2]
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile everytime I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villians just to put the Ville on the map

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Uhm, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if ya'll niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga, who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts."
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name."
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him."
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah



[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Back where I belong
I’ve never felt so strong eh
Feeling like there’s nothing that I can’t try
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is my story this is my song
If you ain't got the heart, don’t attempt to try this at home
It’s just a poem from a man once living wrong
Now I’m in the zone, tell the World I’m coming home
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
Who’d have thought we’d be running rap when we was knee high
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
Or cause I’m famous you don’t gotta know what pain is
But I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind
But one thing I never lose is my grind
My closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can’t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
And then help me get my genius out
And get back to what I had
If my good’s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it’s on my diary, I’m living for my kids
Now they is just as fly as me
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 1]
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin i never liked carrots
But now im older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but now a days more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, im all on the billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga i could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at warren buffet
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a ford, ironic cause i explore
Nigga I explore!

[Verse 2]
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy i can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If i slip i grab the rail ill get a grip and never fail

[Verse 3]
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if i ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga



[Intro]
Yeah
Fresh off the mother fucking broadcast
And I'm here, fuego nigga
Yeah, hey, uh, it's happening fast
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
I told niggas on the low , they ain't hear it though
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow
We eating better than we was a few years ago
Sent you Western Union on pay day, a week later it's mayday
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors
Bill collectors blowing us up, the couldn't fade us
Bitch I made straight A's, go ahead, try and degrade us, haters
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones
Collecting money, a lesson from me: everybody's got a story dog
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog
With hits like a porno blog
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour
Ain't judging though, to each his own
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home
More power to you
But a message to you fuck niggas
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna fuck with you
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new
Same old, fuck it though, what's up with you?
If you made it this far listening without skipping
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?
Yeah that was random man, but so is life
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right
I find myself fiending for a spot to go at night
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life
The unabomber, bitch I'm blowing up overnight (BOOM!)

[Outro]
Hey, yo, it's happening fast
I say it's happening fast
All the drama that I had to get past
Will it last? Or will it pass?
Just as quick as it came
Hoes knowing my name
Dog, welcome to fame
I pray to God we don't change
But even if you don't
Most niggas look at you strange
But I guess I can't complain (Hey)
Hey man it's happening fast
I say it's happening fast
I say it's happening fast



[Intro]
That was the warmup, that was the warmup baby
Aight Elite for real one take dawg and I'm up outta here
One. Yup. Yeah

Lord please forgive me for my sinnin’
I ain’t saying that I’m finished
But I’m praying in advance
Cuz the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yeah ballgame, I swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans
When a nigga took the chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like Bobby had Whitney we was cooking up crack
But the fifteen credits had a nigga off track
Picture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
The master of this rap shit
You hear the words coming from my lips bastards
I never crack I got that ChapStick
I practiced till that shit made perfect
And served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where’s the ladder?
Cause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter
Know you haters is pissed hold your bladder though
‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that
No Soprano, half black half white, I’m a piano
I’m an animal my video on Discovery Channel
I’m a beast when my shit hits the streets these niggas cease
To exist like a beach in a tsunami
You find me in the ‘Ville, in the state of N.C
Bitch, if I ain’t back home I’m up in N.Y.C
‘Bout that money probly like a fucking robbery
But I ain’t jacking, I’m chasing dreams
Sort of like jeans boy I ain’t slacking
I’m chasing dreams, sort of like jeans boy I ain’t slacking
Hey take a hard look at my drive nigga no hacking
On my shit I’m straight smacking niggas, straight tagging niggas
Yo I freestyle and fuck you niggas ya’ll be wilding and I’m out



Yeah, The Warm Up
Lemme stretch out
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They say I'm the down south Nas
The east coast Pac
The Carolina Andre
The Fayettenam Kanye
So join it, ya can't beat it
To all the nonbelievers
If you missed it I'll repeat it
I'm the light skinned Jesus

Here's my thesis for them niggas with them pieces like Reese's
We ballin while we winking at your bitch up in the bleachers
She fiending just to hop up on my shit
Like she was featured on that piece of shit, man
Keep on squeaking like some sneakers on the court
Here's some lines you can snort
Food for thought here's a fork
No pork, dammit keep it pure, organic
What's the score? Lord it's a blowout
You niggas out here shoutin but see me I'm just gonna show out
Bitches destiny no doubt
Niggas testing me more but I'm sure
Look homie I know my shit can give a tour of the sewer
I'm bored this shit is simple
On instrumentals I'm Kimbo, slicing on any tempo
I'm busting like many pimples on the temple
Go hard like I just seen some nipples on Beyonce
No disrespect to HOV but if I didn't I'd be beyond gay
I almost erased them lines but in the end I chose to keep em
Cause if I said it, I really, I really, I really mean it

[Interlude]
Yeah and that's just a Warm Up baby
Lemme give it to 'em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, nigga

[Verse 2]
I rep my city in your city
Just to let you niggas know just where I'm comin from
Ville' nigga troublesome
Gats all around niggas waist like a cummerbund
Leave you leakin' 'til the plumber come
Still we ain't running from no man
Look bitch I'm hot enough to melt a snowman
Ey pack your bags mama we gettin the fuck up outta Po' land
Cause I'm programmed for the dough
While you hold hands with a ho
You ain't got no chance when I flow
Bitch I was a grown man when I was four
Boy, so sit your ass down
You lookin at the class clown
Slash valedictorian, slash hoopin nigga best dressed
Back in school you was just a stupid nigga
And now you're rappin all you talk bout your Coupe is sicker
Your top is dropped but the cops is out here shootin niggas
Stupid nigga, see me I rather tell the truth to niggas
You out here stuntin, niggas is out here frontin
Nigga you good for nothin
I'm freestylin coming off the dome
Bitch Macaulay Culkin Home Alone
I don't even know why I said that
And bitch I get bread that's enormous
Ya'll niggas on my dick man I'm dormant
That means I'm on the low, that means I'm on your ho
That means I'm about this dough
Nigga I'm coming off the dome
Bitch I'm I'll all the way to the chromosomes in my body
Bitch get hit with a 12-gauge shotty
No Maserati, driving like Mr Cosby
Nigga know
I'm coming through I got the sicker flow
I've hit them motherfuckin niggas with that
Nigga know that drunk shit I'll shit
Comin through I spill shit like whoops, bitch
You need to read a book bitch

(Fade Out with J. Cole still rapping)



Yeah
Still at it
Villematic
What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hellbound
With these flows, Cole
And when my story's told
Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow
So, I'm coming for what I'm owed
You know?



[Introduction: J. Cole]
Yeah yeah yeah
Elite Elite Elite... Elite
Ya know

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Yeah, yeah
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym
Regular benchpressin' the bar
Ten steps up from ya'll, you could follow my lead
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Ya'll holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo, at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at Lebron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook: J Cole]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
A dolla and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but naw I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated
I let Elite breathe, yeah
Hey, uh uh uh
I let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey



[Intro]
Yea, Hey, look

[Verse 1]
When she talk she so closed minded
All she want to do is shop she so clothes minded
Wanna cop the latest 'fore them other hoes find it
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it
Probably cause she so fine it'll blow your mind
She black and Pocahontas, laid back and blow that Chronic
Ass so fat wanna tat my logo on it
So any other nigga that a tap, will know it's mine
I put in work overtime, let me cut mow the lawn
Guarantee I blow your mind
She try to play me til she learned I wrote a rhyme
That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that HOVA signed
The rap form Lebron, "Oh girl that boy the bomb"
No chain around his neck but better watch out for the charm
Your not my daughter um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies

[Chorus]
(Ladies) Yeah, ay with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
(Beautiful ladies) Yea, now I ain't tricking but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
(Ladies) Hey, ay clap your hands one time if you know you look good
(All you ladies) Yea if your from the suburbs of the hood
(Beautiful ladies) Yeah aye look

[Verse 2]
She said "I got a man", well baby I don't give a fuck
See me I understand, and I ain't trynna split you up!
Okay give me your number and later I'm a hit you up
If you sleep I get you up, ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up! Yea do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my tee shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She trynna get her freak on, come hop up on this ski jet
You scared of that water of you just scared to get your weave wet
Barely got your feet wet, Yes I know where we headed
Trynna see throw it back let's check your reflexes
Good Lord! didn't know what I was in for!
You can be my cuddy buddy, baby what are friends for
I speed up the tempo, them other niggas lazy
Can't fuck with nothing younger than the 80's
I'm grown and I'm looking for some ladies
Ladies, yeah

[Chorus]
(Ladies) Yeah, ay with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
(Beautiful ladies) Yea, now I ain't tricking but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
(Ladies) Hey, ay clap your hands one time if you know you look good
(All you ladies) Yea if your from the suburbs of the hood
(Beautiful ladies) Yeah aye look



[Intro]
Yeah
Need y’all niggas to feel me, yo
Feel my pain
Said soft niggas can’t last hard times, yo
Believe that shit
Yea, (yeah) ay (ay)
Real niggas don’t cry
Look, yo

[Verse 1]
Was just a youngin’ with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything I’m wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since “Maine” was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I’m a man worried about my fam
Let me explain
Its like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit’s sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
Feeling like the world’s on your back so you stumble
In the field like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble
Jobs don’t call a nigga back, so it’s back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms at the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost faith
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral(damn)

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
I won’t cry (no), I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop- try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry (no), I can’t cry
(ay, ay, ay, yea)
(listen, yo)

[Verse 2]
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weathers bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like, “Damn it’s ’06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?”
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate
And like, three weeks some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement. (uh)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop
Wait, man she just eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
Every week be blasting us, on accident- or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)
They killed her only son
Now she wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel nigga, I can’t watch this

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
I won’t cry (no), I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop- try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry (no), I can’t cry

[Verse 3]
Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits
Violence, hatred, real devastation
Neighborhoods looking like there’s still segregation
Welfare, single mothers, no jobs
Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
Fiends in the street so high off of that crack shit
This nigga thirteen with a GAT under his mattress
White folks got the road to success mapped and that’s all good
But why don’t blacks got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
And it seems like I had prayed for a million days
Still the ills remain, just bills and pain
Shoot outs and project buildings and children slain
Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can’t though

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
I won’t cry (no), I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop- try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry (no), I can’t cry

[Outro]
Yeah, shit dedicated to my cousin Ricky man
Hoop dreams cut short man
Learned he had a baby on the way
Nigga wasn’t even a senior in high school, though
Hold your head man



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, you ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith in all that
But sometimes...
Sometimes you second guess yourself...

That’s human nature, I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?

See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but…
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it..?

Warm up…



[Verse 1]
It's hard to picture a nigga not getting money
J. Cole living bummy? Hahaha that shit is funny
I’m focused on that cash, I just laugh at them bastards
Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor’s
And if this rap shit don’t work, I’m going for my Master’s
Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades
A nigga straight A’s like the Braves
She got me in her dorm room, talking bout her room ain’t clean
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leaves
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seeing
Cuz if the girl get excited, she’s invited. (haha)

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh, I hate to brag, well naw, I don’t, the big man on campus
I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga glances
And if your ass is dumb you won’t even get a chance
Cuz I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga answers, yea
And if I hit ya shorty, keep it on the low
This shit just like highschool, people wanna know
I see you haters mad, but I ain’t mad at y’all niggas
We get ass like them basketball niggas, I’m ballin’
Got a sidekick so them hoes don’t be callin’!
Hit me on aim, ay what’s your screen name?
When I start typing in, a nigga’s got some mean game, yea
And when I whip it out, shit she gonna think she seeing things, but
Back in Carolina I miss home badly, (yea)
It’s funny hoes I couldn’t have is tryna bag me
But I’m in the Jeep with this freaky ass Aggy
She said she want it from the back, gladly

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 3]
I’m skipping class just to get some ass, living fast
And college with no sleep nigga, my jabs quick as Zab's
So kill that old college gangsta shit we dont believe
You mad cuz your girl on Facebook poking me, so uh
You know the G, I hit her up like “Hello Elle
I see you looking right the other day, LOL
So, what’s good with you?”
She hit me right back like “Shit, what’s good with you?”
You know I like that, so of course I write back
Hit her with some nice chat
Same night she in my room, lights off I strike that
Yea I put game right, but that’s your wife, nigga take her
I bust then I kick her ass out to write a paper, yea (hahaha)
A nigga doing homework, drinking like a fish
It ain’t a weekend that I’m sober
Fighting hangovers on my way to my internship
And I forgot to study for my midterm, shit!

[Outro]
Hahahaha, wooo!
Ay, this is straight through, nigga
No, no fucking, no double takes
This is straight through the whole shit nigga
Check it out man, tryna tell y’all niggas man
College is a good look
A real good look, my nigga
For more reasons than one, man
Know they try to keep us out of that shit though
That shit like extra expensive
I got scholarships though, so you know I’m not sweating that
I feel for my niggas that couldn’t make it man
Ay Mike we in there baby, hahaah
Ay they can’t, they can’t keep us out the G my nigga, you know
Then we all make it, nah, we ain’t all make it
Shout out to my niggas, man
All my niggas, yo
Whether you graduated or not
Whether you made it to college or not, nigga
Fayettenam, yeah, yeah
Class of 2007 man
Holla at me
I’m going to grad school though, you know?



[Verse 1]
Momma, I just killed a man
My body still trembling, can you feel my hand?
Don’t shed no tears, it won’t be long before they find out it was me, momma
This may be the last time you see me free, ma, don't spend it crying
You did your best, me, I was blessed, know you were stressed trying
To keep me out the streets, me, ducking police
Trying not to make a peep to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skipping class, flunking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehow I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right, but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you 'shamed of me?
Dry your face, mommy, you're not to blame for me
See, I’m a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder ’bout my father, would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running 'round with the lowlifes?
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas kill for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga momma
But what’s done is done
I’m on the run, I live my life like a movie now it’s way too realer
Who would've thought your baby boy would've grew up to be a killer?

[Hook]
Yeah, now I’m a killer
Guess I’m a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah, I mean the killers

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"I mean—murderers! Do you hear me? Real live murderers!
I thought black people killed people by accident!
Nah, these motherfuckers was murderers."

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wonder whats in store for me
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there’s more for me
Than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot
Work on the John shot
Who woulda thought I used to block this niggas lay ups
Now he’s in a cell layed up
I wish you well, stay up
Like insomniacs
This life can make a nigga fold like a laundry mat
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain
And so that I react slow, in this fast world
Slow niggas, fast girls
Hoes give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on ‘em
Hold up that old checker flag for ‘em
Chalk lines by the do not park sign
It’s deep, all these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I’d rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell ‘em now boy, don’t make me turn into a killer, nigga

[Hook]
Yeah, into a killer
Don’t make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeah yeah

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"Triple life... How do you do triple life?
That mean if he die and come back... He gotta go to penitentiary!
Right there, he said "Fuck kindergarten. Get your little ass on in the penitentiary, motherfucker. You know what you did last time."


[Verse 3]
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day
Swore that we would make the league, be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit
Watch how they pile up
Seem like a mile up
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend
Skating rink is where we headed tonight
And if a nigga disrespect, yes we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seemed petty
At the time, the shit was heavy
Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas go they brains blown out
Snatched a nigga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries
Another body in a cemetary
Another young nigga in the penetentiary
And he don’t give a fuck no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture nigga pictionary
Tell you what it is, I’m a dictionary
I knew a nigga that threw his dick in every chick in every city that he went to
Went hard like the rent do
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict
And he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers

[Outro]
Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I’m a killer



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, what's good baby?
Shit, I ain't seen you in a minute
Now you wanna' hit me

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Shawty I'mma tell you something you don't wanna' hear(yeah), hear(yeah), hear(yeah)
You threw a nigga to the curb
I fronted like I didn't even care(yeah), care(yeah), care(yeah)
But deep down
I needed your umbrella couldn't make it through the rain(yep), rain(yep), rain(Yep)
So I been fuckin' everthing in this town trying to run from the pain, pain, pain
And now suddenly you say you wanna chat, but what is that?
You feel like Kobe, like I'm Shaq
Look how you need a nigga back
Ironic
You burned my heart up like some chronic
Now you say you want it once mo' but what fo'
You did me dirty like some must
So shit why would I?
Plus my niggas know you played me so how could I?
Nah fuck trynna look cool I ain't nobody's fool
I sang the blues for like four months
Now you wanna show up?
You saying that you feenin' for me screaming to me
Boy I need you bad

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
Boy I need you bad as my heart beat (Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breathe (Baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain (Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm about to go insane (Baby I need you bad)
I need you(I)
I need you(I, I)
What I gotta do? (Baby I want you bad)
I need you(I)
I need you(I, I)
Do it all for you (Baby I need you) Hey

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
Baby there's nothing I wouldn't do
To get back what we had when love was true
No lie, I'd give up all I got
Just so I can get back in my spot

[Hook Repeated]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Oh, you want me bad how the cops want black folks
Bad like Dirty Diana
Bad like black toast
Bad like sour lactose like that crack smoke
You feenin'
Left a nigga out to dry like some semen
Baby deaded me
Was far from a dog I had no pedigree, Unh
No leash needed
You ripped up your lease speeded out the crib
Now I'm supposed to just forget and forgive
Pardon, you say I'm your heart
But baby how bad do you want it, want it?

[Outro w/repeated Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
When you want him so bad and you gotta get him back say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
Cuz' it won't get no better til' you are together say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If you believe in ya love and you can't give him up say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If there's nothing you won't do to get back with your boo say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yea
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that due to body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea



[Intro]
For all my ville niggas man
All my Carolina niggas man, (lights off and shit)
All my real niggas, no matter where you come from

[Verse]
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'mma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, "Honey, I'm home."
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer

You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man
My niggas know about the struggle, man
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma



[Verse]
Yeah, uh
God is real and he usin' me for a bigger purpose
So fuck the world that would have you think that a nigga worthless
Sometimes I think that these verses can help a person
Way more than the ones they readin' in churches on days of worship
No disrespect to the Lord and Savior, that ain't just ego
I just observe that them words no longer relate to people
'Cause modern times be flooded with dollar signs
And social media stuntin', my niggas just wanna shine
They frame of mind so far removed from the days and times
Of Nazareth
Life these days is a labyrinth, in a maze so elaborate
We barely get through half of it 'fore it's too late
My niggas is felons from sellin' weight in more than two states
.22 in his waist before he could even shoot straight
Quick to draw on you like Aaron McGruder, nigga who fate?
All of that to say maybe the hood need a new faith
A new story about a boy from not too far where you stay

[Chorus]
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here you go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here you go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here you go



[Intro]
Uh, yea
Let me warm up man, let me warm up man!
I got to warm up man!
Yea, Elite what up! Yea Warm Up
Yea

[Verse]
Look niggas wanna know the formula for success
Sheeitt, but I studied for this test
Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest boy please
Me I'm trynna stretch my treasurer chest, like some double D breast
So a nigga on a quest- no question
So I tell em birds no nesting
Laying in my bed hope to lay a niggas egg, No- you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign, when it's crime
And the gats flyin up in Gotham, watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop em
Watch 'em better leave 'em alone (Malone) like Stockton, when he retired
Shit your shit is fire boy stop
I don't buy it, boycott, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants-ha!
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up
That's cold blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here you can make if from heaven to hell
I'm just a little nigga strait out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blew, with more rhymes due
Nigga you tryning who?
Sheeit, nigga you tryning me, bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Look, it's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
It's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch it's no time to chill nigga! Yep



[Intro]
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, hey
And on the count of three, Blow up, Blow up

[Verse]
Yeah, and that I will, nigga, that I will
I keep a checklist of rappers that I'mma kill
I used to play the bleachers before I had a deal
Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel
Hmm, ill, fantastic
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga, "Jam"nastics
Your style hot now, but they just can't last with
Something like the rap sand-castle
Gone with the tide, I'm here for the seasons
Bend yo' ass over bitch I'm here for a reason
Cold breezin', flow freezin'
This ain't spittin' ho, I'm sneezin'
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them Lowes doors, is what I throw keys in
Man, talk about a come up
Niggas see me in the street they talk about 'The Come Up'
Or talk about 'The Warm Up'
Or "Nigga, when your album drop?"
And why these lil' rappers like to run their mouth alot?
And J. Cole, are you really from the south or not?
I see your jeans, man them thangs, must have cost a lot
Aye do you get a chance to hang out with the boss a lot?
Even them hating niggas like you at the barbershop
Cole.. Yeah, that's my muhfucking name
Nigga couldn't even watch the All Star game
Had to do the whole Valentines Day thang
Gotta play the game, so my lady won't complain
Three or four days, I be back on a plane
Do a couple shows, where the people know my name
Look man, the crowd full of pretty young dames
If you gonna do dirt, then you can't leave a stain, man!
Tiger Woods y'all
He like them white girls, I like them hoods y'all
She got her head straight, she got a good job
She give the best brain, she got them good jaw
I got that good game, that's cause I'm good, y'all
And J. Cole the lil' engine that could, y'all
And yeah I'm coming for the top, like I should, y'all
And bitch I never fall off, knock on wood, y'all
Cole



[Bridge]
I wasn't looking for you
I wasn't searching
I wasn't creeping around
I wasn't lurking
I wasn't sleeping around
I wasn't thirsting
But, I got a thang for you
I got a thang for you

[Verse 1: J Cole]
You on ya job, and it's damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you
Hey, baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make a man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through ya city, I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminding you of Friday
I can take you to DC introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parle, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room, we call this do the hard way, hard way!

[Hook]
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend

Bring em in (x4)
And if they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the grrr! It's just you, me, and them

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl you lookin' like the new Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
A stewardess and yet you flew the leer
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for ya
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catchin' bodies
How I'm stretching you, guess no need to go get pilates
When I'm sliding through ya city, meet me in the lobby
And you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the morning? while you moaning probably
Got you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a hobby
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy
Don't mind me, I put it down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J Cole]
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons
Whisper to ya home girls you love Cole World
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse you know
The type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf footballs
I got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth
Because I'm so clever better than ho-eva
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed, the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (Ahhhh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's 0-11, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you so fed up, and so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header
I won't let up

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
My man Shawn from around the way son been down from day one
Never been known for mistakes but was bound to make one
Her name was Nina, see he was all about the cash flow
Til she came and had this man pussy whipped to the max yo
A true dime piece describin her, brown eyes
Caramel skin, thick thighs, goes beyond speech
But besides looks her mind's lost
Known for kickin cats to the curb, leaving their hearts on the sidewalk
Shawn was one of them, she said she was lovin him
But only fucked him because he had some funds comin in
He couldn't see it though
She was cheating and he didn't even know
He even bought a crib with this schemin ho
In the ride, mad jewels, mad clothes, mad shoes
And to show his commitment he got her name tattooed
I gotta hand it to her, she had the stuff planned out
But watch what happened when her luck ran out

[Hook]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm
[x2]

[Verse 2]
Time passes, Shawn is thinking about wedding rings
But he knows the signs of cheating and doesn't wanna believe them
He disregards them, goes out for diamond ring shopping
Now the big question is when is he gonna pop it
Waiting for the right time
Meanwhile Nina's the same ho
Like a snare drum but bangs way more
For Shawn up to this point shit's going well
Til one day his homeboy hit him on his cell, like
"Yo son you won't believe this, I just seen your chick." ("Where?")
"In the mall with this cat, he was palming her ass
I swear to God son. Need me to run up on him and drop him?"
"Nah, chill I got this, I'll hit you back if it's poppin"
He hung up, I called Nina, "Where you at? What you doing?"
"At the mall with some friends buying new Timbs."
Somethin sounded funny
She was lying for sure
But Shawn had a little plot of his own
Check it

[Hook x2]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm

[Verse 3]
I missed you (Aw)
Missed you so bad I followed you (What, where?)
Followed you all the way to your boyfriend's rendevouz (What?)
Yeah bitch you caught now
So don't even try to give me that shit you thought how it wasn't you who I saw now (No it wasn't)
You trifling ho, I gave my whole life to you yo
And now you basically shove a knife in my throat (It's not like that)
But it's alright though, the same cat you was fucking with then
Is currently laying dead in the trunk of my Benz (Oh God)
Yeah get to crying, in a minute you'll be there beside him
And by the time the cops find you I'll be in the islands (No, I'm sorry)
Visualizin what could have been between me and you
It was just just a dream, you fucked up the thing between us two
So now it's speak your piece before you leave this earth bitch (We can work this out)
I hope that shit was worth it
And now I pray that God is merciless
With this said, goodbye to the reason I lived this life (Shawn)
Pointed the gat to her mouth, long kiss goodnight (No)

[Hook x2]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm



Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrows
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rose
Playing Jigga hits he say good, make more those
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digiornos
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the 'caine
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I've done been a nerd
Just to tutor bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I'm just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got her coming now he might've been the first
So she only fuck with hymn/him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you're black they won't employ ya'
Well nigga I'mma show ya', this that Jesse Jackson
Af-firmative action so master I'm taxing uh
Don't let the cover fool ya', bitch I ain't no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don't gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a Ville nigga 'til the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know what I paid for this shit? bitch, you got damn right!



[Verse 1]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus]
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Verse 2]
Listen
I got a story for ya, when I was seventeen
I had a name, was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nuttin' new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin'
Going nowhere, I figured, "Fuck it, there's a couple hoes here"
I might as well sign up and climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse, spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage, I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like I dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga, DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat fast, the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak, that is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger that killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again, I begged my mom for braces, then I had a

[Chorus]
Crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile

[Verse 3]
Growing up was just a young knucklehead running wild
Momma youngest, e'erybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile, snaggletooth nigga for a while
Liftin' up my pillow, tooth fairy never came around
Damn, we was po', but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily, look and wonder how my teeth'll grow
They came slow and out of line, I couldn't comprehend
The significance at the time, this crooked smile
Was just another sign saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah, remember Brandy? Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga, Sosa, I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear, J's drop
He got a fresh new pair, and there I was with hand-me-downs
Turn into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention

[Chorus]
With this crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Outro]
"Crooked Smile". You know what it is. This is for those that's—that's not picture perfect, but we still worth the picture, you know? As I sit here and sip this Corona. Ayy, shout out to Brandy, man. I—I still got love for ya. I'll never forget, we was in the fifth grade, maybe it was later than that, but remember we was at the [?] we had the orchestra thing and you told—you told a white girl, you told her to tell me that if I went and got some braces that you would go out with a nigga [?] shit. Ah, those were the days. I still got love for ya. You know shit like that made a nigga tough



[Intro: J Cole]
LA, NC, NY
The Chi, yea, hey, yea

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I wake up, hop out the shower spray cologne on while im dressing
They hollering about recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, Im live and breathing so to me that there’s a blessing
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no “F” in
Stepping out today, I got leave the crib
Momma stressing , I pray
That ain't no body gon’ pull the weapon out and spray
Cuz I don’t got no strap
And ever since we hit the depression niggas don't know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya’ll feel the glare I got to go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her
Im fronting “Whats your name?”
She told me “boy you know me don’t play no games-
Now look they say you blowing up hey is it true, fired up?”
I say, “ Girl they wasn’t kidding like they tubes tied up”

[Hook]
I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me whats work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world
Its just me and my favorite girl, now all around they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay so word is spreading
That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle cuz I know they used to say Jermaine
So who changed?
Whats in name though, when niggas can't hang though-your shoe strings
Your flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me?- Im just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real
Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!
This is where they shooting sideways
Boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we high to get away
Now come here ladies see we trynna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon mix it with this Goose, don’t throw it up

[Hook]

[Intro]
2-6, Fayettenam
Carolina, Southeast shit
It's a Carolina thing, from the 'Ville to the QC
All my niggas on Bragg, Bunce Road, to The Murk, Greensboro, Bonnie Doone
Eutaw, Winston, Cliffdale, Durham
Cole World

[Verse 1]
Visions of home, the streets that I roam, it’s been awhile
Raise me like the father I never had, I’m still your child
And though I’ve grown in ways that you’ve never known
I’ve ventured into the world, I’ve moved out all on my own
I’m doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone
Seen shit you wouldn’t believe, I write em down in these poems
And put them out for the world, I know you listening too
Heard you saying shit about me I hope the shit isn’t true
Man look at the shit I came from, this narrow point of view
How you hatin’ on a nigga that wanted it more than you?
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too
And just because I ride with you, I scrap with them niggas too
Came back for them niggas too, ain’t no trappin nigga, it’s true
Yet they play me on repeat because I rap for them niggas too
See I started with nothing but passion and then I blew
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view

[Bridge]
Visions of home, visions of home
Visions of home, visions of home

[Verse 2]
Yeah, visions of home, this is my zone
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song
This for my cousin Ricky damn nigga it’s been too long
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin’ but to each his own
Gotta feed yo’ self, smoke a little weed just to ease yourself
Fuck the whole world, I don’t need your help
You’re the reason why momma had those rocks
All my niggas never even had no pops
Remember that? Ya remember that?
If ya don’t, double back
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street
But I’m still where the trouble at, where the trouble at?
That’s ‘cause my folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long, long
My folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long
Visions of home



[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
We out here moving, J. Cole is here
This has happened before
When the mics are set up like this
You know something's gonna happen

[Break: J. Cole]
Is it on me?
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
You see us, baby
Funk Flex, J. Cole
Who you mad at, me or yourself

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before "Work Out" I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
HOT 97, baby!!!

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Look
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?

[Break: J. Cole]
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever



[Intro: J. Cole]
Sometimes you rip straight through
(I told you how we was gon’ do it)
And sometimes you just love rappin’ this shit so much you just
(Drama I told you how we was gon’ do it)
You just like “fuck it” let me get that shit again
God, please forgive us

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis, he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga, back on my therapist shit
Moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where the scarecrows at
No brains on them niggas but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam, I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag
Beware of the days when the first go last
And the last go first, damn the past sure hurt
That’s why I hit the Henny in this flask
With my foot pressed heavy on this gas
Life is like a Brillo pad
Sometimes I sit and wish I had the life that Willow had
Said I walk around mad ‘cause I never see my dad
And you wonder why my motherfuckin’ brother’s so bad
And I was in the third grade first time I skipped class
Whoa!
Switch topics, look, my bitch tropic
Stack so thick to fit need six pockets
Smash whole cliques, so sick I get nauseous
Quick as pickpockets, slick like Rick Fox’s hair
Diamond chain, yeah the Roc is here
You lean back like a rocking chair
You niggas not prepared, no preparation
This is dedication
Slit your fuckin’ throat and blame it on my medication
Illuminati meeting, showed up late and met a Mason
Who saw me and assured me that there was no better nation
For, crooks and thieves, looks deceive
They throw The Book at niggas with no books to read
See, there I go, every time I try to stunt
Can’t help but kick the real shit
Man, why I even front?
Maybe ‘cause that’s all you little niggas ever want
But I’mma change the game
See you in a couple months, boy

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Hopefully this here shows y’all somethin’
Dedication
What’s ours, and what’s yours
You see the playing field was never really that even
We just let you play the game but you dropped the ball
Cole World
Born sinner
All the way
Drama
You’re welcome



[Intro]
Yeah...
Take ya'll back... to them school days, yeah
Fayettenam, what up, man?

[Verse 1]
We came a long way from stick and move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape
All late to class with fake passes
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Dame Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak
It's all good, I'll probably have a new ex by next week
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that
But what I wouldn't give to go back

[Hook]
Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea I sit and wish

[Verse 2]
Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh
Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low
Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flo'
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts
Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'
But some of my niggas will probably never make it
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor
Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up
Momma cut the light on, "Time to get up, "
Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out
At the time I thought this shit was so whack
But what I wouldn't give to go back
Yea, hey

[Hook]
Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea I sit and wish

[Verse 3]
I'm a little grown, but still reminisce
Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?
Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss
After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim
You forgot your school I.d.? Fuck, nigga, you ain't getting in
In the hallways acting like some hoodlums
See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones
Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say
Twenty people on the phone cause everybody did three-way
Man we played them girls for the fools, but
Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools
Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick
She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn
Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone
I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone
Pardon me ya'll I'm just flipping through some Kodaks
Sitting, wishing I could go back

[Hook]
Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yea I sit and wish

[Outro]
Yeah, this shit is dedicated to all my niggas man
R.J., Mike Shaw, Jim Brown, yea, B. Nasty, Big Joe
Smitty, What's good? Yea
Terry Sanford High School, E. Smith,..
Class of 2003, that's me
I know y'all remember this



Just got off the phone with my nigga Smitty
Shit too real back home boi..
For real..

[J Cole]
This for my nigga Ced, hold ya head
I know shit rough, but nigga we don't give up
We don't get mad, nigga, we just get tough
We just get right, nigga, we don't get left
Fuck what they said, cause what we learned coming up
You can't teach that shit. Life deal a nigga blows
But we eat that shit
This one here's for my brother, we gon beat that shit now
I say my prayers, I got too many people in my head right now
So many that's in jail or they're dead right now
One time for my nigga Craig right now
He in the feds - damn, the times change
And these stupid niggas talking about "crime pays"
You can keep that shit: I just made a million
Call me when you reached that shit
Ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight
And the young boy from a show down in Hampton
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer
Ain't know what to say, I just froze
Little too deep, I suppose..
But after a year of review, I figured out it wasn't me, it was you nigga
Congratulations..



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?

[Outro]
Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up



[Intro]
He gonna have the nerve to fucking tell me niggas from the south can’t spit?
Bitch I’ll smack your dumb ass
(Fayettenam what up? Carolina what up?)
Stupid ass mother fuckers (New York, what up? Queens)
I'mma quit talking shit and about show y’all
I told y’all niggas that I’m getting my bread and going home
I'mma show you all stupid ass motherfuckers (Coming soon, nigga)
Dumb ass niggas

[Verse 1]
The heir to the throne
South nigga bred to the bone
But haters say he fled from his home (please)
Now picture that, I was 18 with million dollar dreams (yeah)
Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akeem
But ain’t looking for no queen, (nah)
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup)
City on my back, I just lift my wings, I’m fly
You niggas on my dick, why lie?
Thought them niggas from the south couldn’t spit, violá
I’m here. humble out of respect, not fear
So please be clear, nigga please beware
I’m a motherfucking monster, B.S. me? (naw)
No, my hand game like fucking PSP!
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon
My dick do the damn thing, honey it’s cumming soon
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (yea)
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave
Rest In Peace, ya’ll boys living too fast
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash
Ville niggas don’t play
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won’t spray?
Mid-day when it’s sunny, they kill niggas broad day
On some old new jack shit
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run

[Hook]
Ha ha ah
I’m the man, hahaha, yea hey
I’m the man
I’m the man, (I told ya’ll niggas)
I’m the man

[Verse 2]
Yea, uh
They say I act like I’m the man, cuz motherfucka I am
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams
Damn boy I'm so flamboyant with the ensemble
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo
And I’m the man, now understand a nigga bossin’, (yea)
Scheming on that drop top CL but it’s costing (yea)
Long term plans for the fam, we’ll be golfing
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless i’m flossing (woo)
In the streets niggas peaceful until you force em'
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss ‘em
Goddamn you niggas got handled
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for ‘em
I know who did it, but you think I’m finna squeal on him?
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him
That’s word, nigga observe my genius
E&J sipping got a nigga straight leaning
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking, (haha)
I told y’all I’m the man, what the fuck ya’ll niggas thinking?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yea
First and foremost, Fayettenam what’s good?
Carolina, what up? Bull city, Raleigh, Charlotte, Salem
Greensboro, Wilmington, nigga
Everywhere dog, I’m repping from long distance, man
I told y’all boy, I’m bout to get this money and come home right quick
Y’all niggas still see me tho, you think I’m still there; you ain’t even know I’m gone
Back so much, nigga
I hear you all little niggas talking, nigga
Prince of the city, nigga
Prince of the south, nigga, holla at me
Ya know? Heir to the throne, bitch



[J.Cole]

(Cole World)

[Verse 1]
Now you can choose the easy or hard way
Cole took the long way
A loser car-ley I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jay’s lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC A 'n' T, where I found that TNA
Ain’t seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasn’t nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They waitin' on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappin' in diapers
To rappin' in cyphers
Ta doing more numbers
Then all them fuckin' lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you 'bout to get
Take a bite rock wit it
And I love a bad bitch with confidence
Yo smile nice yo style right
And girl you got some mean thighs
So this right he is mean time
In between time

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Kirko bangz]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Only if you got that sip type
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Outro]
H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup
I got this drink in my cup
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea



[Hook]
Uh, yeah
I said it won’t be long (no)
‘fore we out here baby
Gotta get you up out here baby
Said it won’t be long
‘fore we out here baby
We up out here baby

[J. Cole Verse 1]
I say a prayer and look up in the sky
Thank God even though a nigga headed to this tired day job
Will my eyes stay wide still I know I’m gonna blow
This is music for my niggas cause I know you want more
Cause that old shit fake but this new shit real
J. Cole not Jay but this that Blueprint feel
Hey Cole is you crazy that's some big boots to fill
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well
Seen heaven, seen hell, seen niggas get killed
Knew every detail still never would tell
Scared of the repercussion, scared of them people bussin'
Bullets be hittin’ nigga’s you swear they could be percussion
Niggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing
No law, but became a man on my own
Showed my momma I could stand on my own

[Hook]

[J. Cole Verse 2]
Dear mama, your son hurting
Living in this cold World where niggas shun virgins
And praise hoes
As days go by shawty 19 years old
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly
Tell me why mamma do you cry
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise
Mamma I know it hurts
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him
So whats the options for him
A young nigga from the hood without a pops at home
Surrounded by no good
And soon no good becomes so good quick
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich
Killing your hood with the same shit Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with
And it’s still in your hood shit
I’m feeling no good mamma
I’m sick of my soul
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope
I just hope and I pray
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way
And mamma I can fly you out this cold world
This cold life, it’s all wrong
There’s no right
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light
Just grab onto me, trust me hold tight!

[Hook]
[End]



[Verse]
Yeah, ain’t nuttin' to it but to do it, nigga that's true
A quarter milli and a Buick, nigga guess who?
It came to me like the dream that I once had
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you
Clearly, now hear me
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Life make a nigga wanna yell out
Change for that fame, how some niggas turn sell out
Too old for my mama crib, I'm tryin to get the hell out
Stayin' out these cells but we working on that bailout
Help out, please. Sure is hard livin without cheese
Ain't shit in my pocket only these house keys
They pray for a nigga but yet they doubt me
That's why I'm out getting higher than balconies
But no I won't jump, being broke is childish and boy I'm grown up
My money runnin' late tho so boy I won't front
When my paper finally make you should know I'm gonna stunt
So, hard

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My God, my life is such turmoil
Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me don't let my guard down
I gotta get it my nigga

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Never believe what they say
Man, I gotta get paid
Dawg it's so damn amazing
How I'mma shock the World
I'mma shock the World
Hell naw I ain't lying
Yea, I gotta get mine
Dawg it’s about time
So I'mma shock the world
So I'mma shock the world

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar, system hopin' I soak up
Enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was closer to my dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said you owe us
Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and then a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
And you could see it even when I'm Sleep
My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson
Or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin' on his grind
This the life of a Compton nigga
I know the vanities of the world like the promise niggas
That's why we crooked, in yo bushes where you find us nigga
You better scramble before you fold like an omelet nigga
This ain't insomnic nigga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me
So when I catch a fade they know to put more than one on me
Fear no evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up
Niggas tuck like a baby in fetal, position
If you listen you can hear the city needs you
That's what my mind said
But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a black Beatle
Until my number is called and someone yell bingo
A shadow in the dark, park the coupe
Then recoup with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar



[Intro]
Yeah, this is the... warm up

[Verse 1]
Okay, I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up, had a hole up in my pocket, now it's sewed up
They feinin' for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it, better load up, I hang my coat up
Aye, I'm gon' be here for a while so I smile, haters
I'm on that green like a flower, like an alligator
Now or later, I'm serving niggas; I'm a sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how I cater, dog what you afraid of? Nothing
They talking gangsta without no data, they fronting
Jackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting
I wish a nigga would say something
I'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back
Piggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat
And I'mma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at
And I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques
Shoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Yea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick
They say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit
And I tote my horns. A star when I was born
My name ain't James, my word is bond
Yea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99
Damn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past
You're listening to the future
The flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool
I said I got a girl, she told me, "Me too! "
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it

[Break]

Yea and this is only "The Warm Up" yea



[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Maine on fire, my empire be higher
Than an octave on Mariah, you niggas should worship sire
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars
I was David promising the world that I'mma serve Goliath
Then I swam with sharks, made it to the land and parked
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as satan's worst desires
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo
Get my head out the window
20k in my pocket as im feeling the wind blow
And I ain't have a wallet since Nintendo, comprendo
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo
I used to wanna save the world, now all I do is spend dough
Till I snap back like Hov hat
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that

[Hook]
Maine on fire
Top down bitch i ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Maine on fire
Every week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots many bottles pop
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

[Verse 2]
We collect a hundred thou
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now
I was such a cunning child
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you
The one your mama glad you hung around
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor, nigga
But its just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas
We just let the paper blind us
While vaginas chase behind us
Take notes make money don't make jokes
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats
Real shit but if the world really bout to end
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again

Huh

[Hook]












[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 1]
Hey, oh no, not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick?
If so, I take her on a voyage
I like 'em long-legged, mega thick
Work it out, you know, employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit?
Cause I keep clogging up the toilet
Coley Cole, fresh as a 4-week old
Not a scratch on me, hoes ask for me
Niggas ask about me, silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the real, this nigga give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label give you the deal
You remind them of me, let's see, how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will?
Ill

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 2]
Enough of that bullshit cake rap
With your childlike scriptures
I'm busting off, nigga, take that
Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood say "We fucking with you Cole, see?
And we're gonna ride right with ya
Yeah, we know you got college degrees
But we got priors like Richard"
And here we are, raps just like CPR
Nigga turn on your TV, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like E.T., completely we be from Mars
Damn he got bars, as if he's speaking of CB4
Need a barrage of freaky broads to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minajs, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods, and yes
Her ass clap and so that's a round of applause, I guess

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?



[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, look how I came up
Yeah, ayy, look how I came up, nigga
Ayy, look

[Verse]
Momma I came up
Cold as hell in New York but I flame up
Straight up out that dirty type of shit you cannot clean up
A dollar and a dream the only things I had to bring up
Now any nigga out there gunning for me gotta aim up
Say what, niggas ask me what the Ville be like
Just tell em that it's real, hoping that they me feel me, right
I'm so bright I close my eyes and I can still see light
I'm so live you motherfuckers gotta kill me twice
Man, I promise I'm murdering classics, paying my homage
The fifteenth of the month and I'm just now paying Mohammed
Said the rent's due on the first, but he don't know the shit
I been through and it hurts, can't wait to blow
Yeah, I think about heaven sometimes, can't wait to go
If it's real will I even get in, I ain't fo' sure
'Cause I've been sinning
Getting bent it's been a minute since I been
Up in a church
Only time is when my friend up in a hearse
Lord, I'm praying for me my Momma
I just went up in her purse
Not to steal
All I saw was some bills and not a dollar
In sight
It’s time she lived a more desirable life
I'm chasing money
And dreams only God got the means to take em from me
I scheme while I'm riding through Queens
I ain't no dummy
A Fayettenam repper 'til the day that I'm gone
Nigga get your weight up all the way up if you hating on me
Cause boy I might pray but ain't no preying on me
I'm hot like Satan just laying on me
So when you get to hell you can say you know me
I said I might pray but ain't no preying on me
So when you get to hell, you can say you know me



[Verse 1]
The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip
Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one
Ain't nobody else I’d rather be, not even Oprah’s son
Momma’s youngest gettin' paper like the oldest one
We livin' better, guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggas in hoopty
But we still bag hoes and them
These niggas give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we dovin' them
Ass fat so when pinch ‘em like a Doberman
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What’s your name
Where ya from
Ya got a dream
I’ll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey and don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got

[Refrain]
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
And don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

[Verse 2]
There’s so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I’m blessed nigga, I’m blessed
When I’m all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn ‘em into poems, they worship, I’m the best
And though I’m takin' long
They fuck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleepin'
I put you niggas to rest
The only one sayin' shit is like a nigga got tourettes
Unimpressed with you niggas
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey, dont stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it



[Intro]
Who dat who dat?

[Verse 1 - SD]
Back up on my 1, 2, 3 metaphors
I'm rhyming with CD, you would think I'm in stores
And y'all know me, I'm D-O-P-E
Screaming skins all day, no MTV
I see a girl giving out blows like a prize fighter
I'm on top of the words: call me a highlighter
Oral sex in the morning: that's a head start
Words like bullets, yeah I'm shopping at a Lead Mart
State of the Tar Heel, fuck how y'all feel
Young but I'm good, I got that fuckin John Wall feel
While y'all pissed off, I sit and sip Cristal
Hornet's nest flow, I assist like Chris Paul
Flow like a quick river, lines like a stick figure
So many drinks, I'll probably borrow someone else's liver
And I'm warming up just like a fireplace
I know I'm an acquired taste, go ahead and try to hate
But I'm just a brainiac who don't know where his brain be at
I'm smoking Huckleberry so I guess I'm Mark Twaining that
They told me I was insane, in fact
I'm tryna get my train on track
So you should probably counteract
The fact that you attacked the Datt

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Who dat who dat? You know what you been waiting for
I mean, the game was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshit - listen, I ain't hating, no
Now a brother, hot enough to fuck with one of satan's hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning
Feeling god would never listen
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Man, just look at how I elevated
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated
That means my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Just try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so the fiends keep on yelling back

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Childish Gambino]
I won't steal your girl? Test me
I stay Childish, watch me breast-feed
Grandfather ran numbers a criminal in Harlem
The only thing he used to make was trouble and my father
Father had me, said "Stay away from cocaine!"
Blood stained gangster, my swag screams dope game
I talk real nigga, this is what you ask for
I shit green like vegetarian assholes
Louder than Wayne's pants at the VMA's
Stick to what you good at nigga! Oh, everything?!
Niggas want me everywhere, I'm yelling out "Sorry!"
There's only one of me like white girls with black Barbies
Niggas mad that I ain't do shit too
I got a fly Asian bitch, that's a Shih Tzu
Throwing out your jazz man, but you don't look like Uncle Phil
Fucking girls from TV shows, my DVR is on the pill
Shake it on Youtube, yeah that's a VEVO ho
Black guy with a white voice, Cleveland Show
I don't know, all I wanted was different things
Hope these hood niggas don't blow me off when they're listening
All I do is wear what white guys wore in the '50's
And for some reason these white people think that it's interesting
Too many girls, that's still not enough for me
I love pussy like that old lady up the street
Everything I spit is compilated and best of
Black nerds run shit, go and ask Questlove
I'mma hit it twice, retail
I got a package like a gansta, G-mail
Google and a penis reference, same sentence, goody goody!
I love my dick so much they let a nigga host the Woodies
Got a whole barbershop like, "Oh man, this shit is tight!"
Solid shit.. one wipe..



[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It’s ya nigga, deep thinker, big drinker
Late night, with ya wife in ya crib sneaker
When you out of town, and you not around
Turn your ass over like a nigga stepped out of bounds
Crowd around young’n
I got ammo and a lot of rounds coming
Up in the streets where you not allowed, runnin’
Got the songs bitches ride around hummin’
And the niggas stay thumpin’
And the hater’s hate pumpin’
Got the 808′s bumpin’
So the trunks stay thumpin’
And the nigga get high only on occasion and
My mind too wild
Damn thought weed supposed to calm you down
But I’m so high I could palm two clouds
Boy look, these niggas quote my lines like the Lord’s book
You niggas less rhymes more hooks
More bucks but less love
You hear them drums, Questlove
No Roots, I’m so truth
I used to rock sidelines like a coach suit
Had to look at all them loafers, yeah them boat shoes
Now I’m in the game but I won't boast to you dummy
Remember niggas had short jokes for my money
Toast to the honeys, money and the liquor
And bitch I don’t sound like any other nigga
With my finger on the trigger
I burn rappers like Henny on the liver
Grant death wishes like a genie I’m a killer
Lord giveth and he taketh like an Indian giver
Hard to keep jimmy in zipper
When you got them bad Aunt Vivians with ya
Remy and weed, I got em on Pluto
I prefer Henny but the hoes like Nuvo

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Check, every time a nigga roll
Old school whips and it’s sitting on vogues
Hoes on me when I enter the door
If a nigga wanna trip, good grip on the chrome
Empty out a clip from the fifth then I’m gone
Twist up a spliff, get a fifth of Patron
Hate a chick who just talk shit on the phone
Baby I’m tryna stick, give ya dicks to ya dome, shit
If I was you nigga I would hate him
Hot August nights I’m out there in Vegas
Stuntin' til time, had that patience
Now it’s big faces, fly vacations
Alias Shawn Stacks
Miss shows, never call back
Blowin’ Dro sippin' tall cats
On the low had to crawl back
Niggas wonder if it’s all raps
Or it’s all facts

[Verse 3: Omen]
As I step in the door like Fe fi foe
With the heat like flow and the beat typo
Better rewrite yo, get your rhyming straight
Get murked plus 8 like Jon and Kate
I mean it’s time for the face off
Hit the corner like an 8 ball
Man I concentrate like Adolf
No time for a hater, get a day job
Me on the mind you ain't even on the radar
Love her brain but I never been a fiend for her silly ways
So I’m tryna get the cream til I’m silly paid
Couldn’t put her on the team, every week another reason
To scheme like Billy Mays
Gotta grind gotta focus
Gotta shine through the minds of the blind, lot of hopeless
Never confined to the rhymes that I’ve chosen
Omen, a sign of the times, gotta quote this



[Intro]
Let me try this
Uh, Yeah
Money coming soon
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
Omen what up nigga?
Yea niggaaaa, yea, uh

[Verse 1]
Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?(true)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that! (haha)
Like fuck it I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks spend dough on mad shit for stuntin,'(yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid. (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things, (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin'
But them whites ain't. (hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation,"(yea)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating,)
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em. (yea)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention, (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition, (ahaha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition, (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't into doing, they into wishin,'

Yeah
Uh
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln



[Verse]
I bet they never seen him coming, like a blind bitch you fucking from behind
It's the mother fucking time, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like Lebron
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks
Flip, flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Half black other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a Cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me "Nigga stizz-op
You know you is not", wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip hop gassed up like a quick stop
They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot
Even if you squatted over volcanoes niggas your shit not
I'm raw, but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legend
Praise God but I give not to the reverends
Looking up to the heavens like
"Where did all my blessings go?" You chase a dream
But then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch, here's an episode, professional
Set to blow any minute now, many women smile
Look the lights and the action, and the cameras be calling
You niggas got to log in, bitch, you fantasy balling
I snuck up like I planned to be, this ain’t random, we called it
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that Twitter shit
Thought I get a deal and head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal I probably can't afford benefits
Medical, dental shit, left but I always came
Back like a rent-a-whip, dirty ass game
Dog, I could run a kennel with all these bitch niggas
Who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me, I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on them
Start talking that beef shit, I turn to kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yea! And I'll still keep going, keep flowing



[Hook]
Is the whole world gunnin for me
Or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothin but time
One day youre gonna set me free
But first you got to let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look mama I’m flying

To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
I’ll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, no, I’ll never ever land

[Verse 1 - J Cole]
Check my fortune cookie, it say Cole World
Could that mean it's meant to be?
So much drive a nigga could've been a chauffeur
This life is fuckin with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they're a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemy
My good girl say they want to know the inner me
My bad girl saying "fuck all that, enter me"
Double shots, Hennessy, bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut somethin, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them motherfuckas sign off
I got them on my dick, they’ll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off
I don’t know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
I’m sortin through this
Organized confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is soundin like a movie you can watch forever
I got to make it to the top, its either now or never
These other niggas can't adapt because they're not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter?
Cole World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And so sick they can’t fix this with modern medicine
We at your door and she's got to let us in
It’s what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now I’m what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as I’m speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I got to catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like I’m the underdog, I’m on already
Got a few niggas we about to prove wrong, yall already already



[Intro]
Ayy, yeah
That new Rihanna shit
That new Rihanna shit
Look

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Verse 1]
I guess they know that I'll cut a bitch
Boy, I'm already paid, getting money for the fuck of it
I'm on some other shit
So if you fly, what am I, do that make me the mothership?
Beam me up ho, they wanna see a nigga down
Take his crown, we be up doe, yeah we be up ho!
Now hit the ground, bow down to the sound
Good God

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Verse 2]
I guess they know that I'll cut a ho
Yeah I cleaned up good but I'm still out the gutter though
Don't forget this shit
You gotta problem? Then meet me outside if you with the shit
I've seen where the players sit
A couple racks gone just to see 'Bron hit the layup, shit
I be on some nigga shit
But bitch, I'm way past nigga rich
Good God

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way

[Verse 3]
Cole World, used to stay off his dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old-ass Laker
But I ain't come to talk about all that paper
That's what they talk about when they ain't got shit to say
Can't understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know they sayin' same shit, nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cuz on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows, hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish n' chips
Why I do a lot of shows, I'm the shit that's it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never sent you to the hoes, word to Cliff and Chris
If I fuck six bitches I got six assists

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way

That new Rihanna shit bump
That new Rihanna shit bump



[Intro]
Yeah, uh
Uh, yea
Yea, uh
Fayettenam, nigga
Hahaah uh
Carolina, nigga
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Uh, uh, uh
Nothing but sweat, tears
Just another perspective
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play where killers hung at and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that get gun clap for sneakers
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Who am I trusting?
No time to think about illegal when your stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busting
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
Cause, uh, it wasn't set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)

[Hook]
The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it gets better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)

[Verse 2]
Yea, uh
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto bird circling
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursing them, (fuck)
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We young, black, some strapped
Them whites got they lunch pack for school, we had our guns packed
And all a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
You kill a nigga over beef and cheddar even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest soon
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas still cursin em
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!

[Hook]
The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it get better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that

[Outro]
Nobodies feelings getting hurt, nobody getting mad



[Hook]
More liquor when we ride
Toast niggas, we alive
Golddiggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me? I’m in the front seat, driving like I’m 1 deep
If you want to come see, you know where I’m at
Go-getters on tha rise, toast niggas we've arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big thangs on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Get brains from a dime, how you love that?

[Verse 1]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now coming
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground running
I ain't never been the one for fourth down punting
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown hunting
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lockpick just to lock shit back
I want "Money, Power, Respect" since The Lox said that
Better stay up on ya toes, this is not tic tac
Yeah, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Balling like a Laker, you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peating
And I’m knee-deep in the game
It's quick sand and I keep sinking
The label heat seeking, nigga ain't sign me
What the fuck was he thinking?
They say I killed the game, that was only preseason

[Bridge]
I’m heavy
Lil' nigga I’m heavy
I’m so heavy, I’m feeling heavy
Carolina I’m heavy
In New York I’m heavy
Out in LA I’m heavy
I’m so heavy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No album to my name and I’m already hot
You can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling yours be seated
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in tha game bitch and you can retweet it
Email that shit, make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I'll be in the airport damn near barefoot
Security hollering out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I dont even be weeded
No point drinking I can’t even be faded
Real recognise real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late now it’s happy belated

[Outro]
I'm heavy
Nigga I'm heavy
Hey, I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga, in New York I'm heavy
Queens, I'm feeling heavy
Fayet-nam nigga, I'm so heavy
I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga I'm heavy



[Hook - J Cole]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it

[Verse 1 - J Cole]
This is The Ville, home of the fast-lifers
Where we get high and don't come down, we gas prices
Man, I wonder how hard to live my past life was
Cause this one hard, I could show you my scars
I ain't crying tho..
They say that pity's for the next man
Or that girl getting beat down by her ex-man
Hey, hold your head, mama
I know you wish that nigga dead, mama
If I can find a way to kill him, I won't have man drama
Damn mama, tell me who you love
This one is for the boy that sees his mama on drugs
If feel your pain, boy.. just know that I been through the same, boy
That lady needs you more than ever
Don't be ashamed boy
Cause when it rained, boy, that was your umbrella
The one that changed your pissy sheets when you was a young fella
And now she in the bedroom on her knees
Staring at the sky, screaming "Lord please!"
Tell me now:

[Hook - J Cole]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it

[Verse 2 - Omen]
Soon as you cling on, my mind's saying "be gone!"
I leave em with wrinkled foreheads, they now Klingons
Confused, cause friendship's abuse and I'm sorry for it
My life performance been trifling, sometimes I fight my conscience
Was never given spades, but I always had the heart
Always misplaying the hand that was dealt the joker cards
What I was spending like, lonely low energy
Performance slow clinically, rolling over we finna be
Don't pity me ever, when them haters answering
Mindset of a victor, no victim, I'm just a champion
Money come in slow, God, intervene
Spirit's never broken, I'm just focused, don't pity me
No no no, you see this pain put a strain on my whole life
I seen the rain, seen my dreams turn to long nights
But all I ask is don't pity me, no!
Don't pity me, no!

[Hook - J Cole]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it

[Verse 3 - Voli]
I freestyle life, can barely write the rent
Yearly income can barely keep this music life in check
Call up mama, hate to borrow money, but Christmas near
Hey you know what? How about we make each other gifts this year..
Friends are calling me up, asking me if I'm signed yet
Who I'm working with? Am I making dollar signs yet?
Disappoint them, within their voices - do they pity me?
Disbelief - I'mma stay drilling like them city streets
But ah, it seems like every day is rainy weather
Can barely fit my pain and pride the same umbrella
But he don't care, he don't care, it's hard to keep em dry
No more caterpillar, now you see him change: peeping Tom
This life would flash before your eyes
And get your mash before your ride turns to ash
No more drive, no more gas, before you cry, get your last
Before you die, life your past with no regrets
Broken necks, no looking back man



Damn, broke as a bad joke... but still I laugh though
Frontin' trynna have hope, it's sad though
I'm tired of being broke as shit
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6
Ay man I just graduated, good old college degree
Shit, my niggas drug dealing see more dollars than me
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thang
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like "you a lame-
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man you insane"
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga 'bout to be though
So give me one year then play this back like TiVo
Cause boy I'm finna blow - I'm a mothafucking torpedo
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquitoe
Uh, I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit
Feel like a goddamn kid, man I'm Pac and Big (What up?)
"Up" is something that I can't give
Won't see me disappear like the old Ant Viv'
Cause even on a slow jam I'm so damn sick
Man I even spread a virus to a program-quick
I gotta focus on my flow and get some dough, man, shit
No dollars got me acting like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and to my ex-lady
Yea we've been complicating things with the sex lately
Maybe I'm being selfish - but, naw, I can't help it
Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtics - Jersey
Regardless of where God lead us
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina
But I'm through living in the past Lord
No more thinking rewind and more fast forward
Less rearview mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizing cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my momma a whip, nigga, and she ain't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle, nigga...

I'd like to welcome ya'll to
My life, my life, my life, my life, in the sunshine...



[Intro]
(Coast to Coast Instrumentals)
I don't know what the hell that is
Should have just called Puff for the fucking instrumental
Fuck it, no time for that boy!
Cole World

[Verse 1]
They say we living in troubled times
Aye, do you see the trouble signs?
Aye, lifes a bitch, and I'm cuffing mines
My dough in flipmode, what up to Busta Rhymes
I used to never see green, I was colorblind
Now I get my hustle on
Pay dues like a hair salon
My way like a Usher song
Higher power where these verses from
You niggas hoes, put your purses on
Church, get your worship on
Born alone, work alone, die alone
Hot fire like Dylan
Bitches get their dial on
Fake niggas get dial tones
I ain't no Viacom nigga
I'm a fire arm, nigga
Look how I alarm niggas
Watch my dope pile on
'Til it's like a mile long
Niggas couldn't fill my shoes
Couldn't even try 'em on
Showed your lil' ass look
That's how you take it
Two-facing niggas, couldn't tie my shoe laces, boy!

[Verse 2]
That was the warm up, this is the blow up
Now if you ain't talking no bread boy, ain't no need to show up
Man they say I'm repping the Ville too much, but fuck it, so what?
When my niggas carrying toys like they don't wanna grow up
When my sisters drinking like fishes and won't even throw up
Let's po' up, get to' up, know the police gon' show up
I slow up
Some niggas ain't got no luck
Some niggas can't get no love
Some of 'em can't get no bucks
So tell me what do a nigga do if he can't get a job?
My brother got him an interview, but he can't get a ride
What's up God?
No this ain't no Wu-Tang shit
This is my lil' fire drill, just some routine shit
Just to shoot fiends with
And hold 'em off a lil' longer
Every verse I write I swear I'm only getting stronger
Can you ponder?
Imagine what my shit gon' sound like
If I told you that The Warm Up was just a sound bite
Damn right, believe I put it down right
And I'll be sure to tell you lil' niggas what that crown like
I showed you love, I brought you through
I gave you pounds right?
Aye, in my face, you knew your place
And so you smile right?
So why I'm here, and now you talking like a little girl?
You sound like Whitley, nigga
Me? I'm from a different world
Your shit is garbage
If I drop you, I'm a litterbug
Busy getting money
I ain't fucking with that Twitter, girl
Fuck what they say, wishing me harm and sorrow
They here today, bet they be gone tomorrow
They catching Z's on me, aye we gon' call 'em Zorro
I'll let you sleep today, but it's on tomorrow
Yeah, I said it's on tomorrow
I'm coming for the game
And I ain't talking loan or borrow
Pray for the days I get cash, checks and never weary
This the last stretch, I'm a half step from legendary



[Verse 1]
I'm on The Come Up
Chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga, finna' rise and shine like the sun up
My mind on that paper, I ain't trying to wife the slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't trying to wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up
Uh, don't shed a tear if a nigga might get done up
But, just say a prayer if a nigga might confront us
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the 'Ville? You need to get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, Cobain a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flame, baking soda and water
And if you feel that then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggas like a nigga was still a baby
Carolina nigga shout-out to the 'Ville that raised me
So many hoes whipped, you would've thought we still in slavery
And niggas still sleepin they feelin lazy
Uh, a killer maybe, you make me I will
Cheat me on my scrilla, I send you to meet Dilla
From them NC streets where the beef they deliver
And the clip is on E cause your chest got a fill up
While a nigga like me is just getting head like a pillow
Bread like gorillas getting bred
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed
Fuck what a nigga said, man, I'm Fayettenam bombing
Cause hatred is flattery you bitch niggas is charming
Who the fuck you harmin'? Boy, ya'll niggas is charmin'
And I'm armed and waiting for a target
You fucking with the best like Carmen
Aw shit, pardon a nigga for departing
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden
A nigga finna blow while you niggas is false alarmin'
And just think, man, I was raised on ramen -- chicken noodle soup
Now I'm filet mignon-in'
I promised my momma I was coming to make this money
And I swear I'm going to kill the nigga that try to take it from me

[Outro]
Yeah, that's real talk, nigga
It's J. Cole, nigga
Therapist whatever the fuck you wanna call him -- it don't matter
You know, I'll make y'all niggas understand man
I know you can't believe yourself right now
You thinkin' this niggas from the south -- hahaha -- he can't spit -- how the fuck is he so good?
Open your eyes mothafucka, can you see? Niggas on top
Yup. We on top



[Verse 1]
Aye baby tell me have you ever seen a nigga chasin' dreams
Leavin' everything he love behind to make this cream
Kisses his momma on the cheek, say, don't worry I'll be back
I gotta get you out this shit, I'm a hurry, I'll speed back
You see, that's the type of shit the boy be thinkin' when he dreamin'
And he don't pay no mind to them niggas that's disagreein'
Sayin', nigga, is you crazy
Them same ones that's talkin' be the same ones not doin' shit
Aye, nigga is you lazy
Or is you scared to follow dreams
I know you gotta have one
The opportunities be in yo' face
You gotta grab one nigga
But while you're bullshittin'
I'll be woodgrippin' gettin' wealthy
On the road to riches, God help me
I'll holla at ya'll niggas when I see you, wouldn't wanna be you
Cause you fear what I don't, see this here is what I want
So I'm a get it poppin', I'm rockin' despite the obstacles
Look, my nigga what you call impossible is possible

[Refrain]
Aye, tell my niggas to keep they heads up
We made it too damn far just to give it up
And we way too strong
This is a song for the Ville
Yeah, yeah
And baby don't cry, you know I'm comin' back
I did it for the city, gotta get up on the map
And I know we gon' shine
This is a song for the Ville, yeah

[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressin', I know it's temporary
Starin' at my granny obituary
She almost made it to eighty before they buried
Damn, can't even tell you I'm sure I'll to make it to 30
Cause you never know, sometimes life takes a turn for the worst
Is you holdin' on to will, or did you let it go
Heaven knows I'm tryna hold on
So every night I pray and hope my life is prolonged
The journey seemed so long but hold up
Don't take me up
I got big dreams nigga, ya'll can't wake me up
Life's a bitch but death don't break me up, I got too much to live for
It seems too many niggas die with way too much potential
Gotta get up out this trap even if I got to scrap
I'll lay a nigga down flat before I'll let him hold me back
Ya see I ain't afraid of obstacles
But what you niggas call impossible is possible
Yeah, so aye

[Refrain]

Aye, some niggas take they life for granted, wastin' time
Time is money my nigga, I cannot waste a dime
Or a minute, too much business to handle to be sleepin'
Too much spinach to eat for niggas beefin'
So I'm out here trick or treatin', can my niggas comprehend
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, motherfucker let me in
Stop hatin' that's a sin, why these niggas so sinful
I guess they hate to love a nigga, yes it's that simple
As I ride through the city, feelin' lucky to be breathin'
I know a couple peers that didn't make it to the season, pour it out
See I believe that things happen for a reason, no doubt
Strange times, as I watch these niggas throw they gang signs, and they strapped
Crips or Blood, nigga we all black
From the same city, the same schools we was taught at
Aye fuck the drawbacks and obstacles
Man what them teachers call impossible is possible nigga, yeah

[Refrain]



[Intro]
Yea, haha, yea, uh, yea
Real niggas can relate yea
Haha and them 'Ville niggas can relate man
Yea, yea uh

[Verse 1]
I see you looking at me hard shawty, what it's gonna be?
But you right next to your man, don't let him run up on me
'Cause I see him tryna grill, better take his ass home
Before I lay his ass out, then I take ya ass home
I even gon' front man a nigga tryna cut
I ain't tryna take his place, I just want to hit you up
When that nigga ain't around I just want to pick you up
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up
Then I give you a massage, get you wet, get you up
Then I give you what you want, if it's clean I lick it up
Now you can do me, if it's right my shit is up
Face down on your stomach, take that ass and lift it up

When you in the bed alone why ya man run the street
All you got to do is dial, let the phone ring twice
Baby girl I love your style, I won't even think twice
I ain't even gonna front, man a nigga tryna beat
I ain't tryna wife you up, though you is a dime piece
I just love the way you ride like a certified freak
How you throw it right back, got a niggas thighs weak
So just hit me when you want it, you know how to find me
Got no times for no games, you know how the grind be
But-I'm a make the time if you bout' it dial me

[Intro]
Yeah, Hey, Warmup
Hey yeah
J. Cole, cause I got it yea
Hey warm up, yea hey uh yea
Cause I got it

[Verse 1]
I remember me and my niggas goin' hard on that BlackPlanet shit
Was finna go to college, need a BlackPlanet chick
While you was playin' hard like a BlackPlanet Crip
Talk that shit in real life I had to backhand a bitch
Remember back in '99 my favorite rap Canibus
Bomm Sheltuh was the shit, Nervous Reck and the clique
Put the battery in my back, gamme' the gat and the clip
Now these hoes want a nigga phone number and a dick
'Memba back in '98 that's when I first planned this shit
Watch when I hit the streets these new niggas can't exist
When ya'll was wearin' rap diapers I was tearin' down cyphers
This ain't no overnight I put in time like a life
'Memba back in middle school they used to think that I was hyper
Now I throw the Ritalin in my flow, get 'em hyper
Watch for vipers, that girl is a snake
He gon' wife her, shit
You know powder blue suit, white Nike her
Hey she that nigga leftovers
You the microwave
The bitch done seen more clubs than Tiger, (aye)
Get a driver plate, while he drive away
Yea you was almost fly but your flight delayed
A little late boy
Me and my niggas been eatin' off little plates boy
And yeah I'm hungry so trust me don't feel safe boy
This is Carolina's finest
I'm high without the marijuana, honest, I promise

[Hook]
Yeah, Fayettenam
Yea, you know that I got it
Yea you know man
I'm a sure shot right now homie, I got it

[Verse 2]
Ay 1996, my own room now, I'm hangin' posters up
Holes up in the wall my stepfather said I ain't supposed to
But I'm hoop dreamin', hangin up pictures of my idols
Jordan was like Jesus, SLAM was like the Bible
I used to read it twice and cut the pictures out
Had the Jordan free throw dunk tongue stickin' out
Focused tryna' figure out, should I leave it here or move it there
Even hung them shits on the ceiling
I had to use a chair
Cause I was only like eleven, ain't even had no pubic hair
Told my mama when I make the league I promise you a crib
And I meant it, was ill wit the pill
Real skinny nigga, you couldn't tell me I wasn't a little Penny nigga
Pictures of Reggie Miller, even David Robinson
Kobe with the half-fro Stackhouse and Iverson
Was all over, reflectin' my life, boy, you heard me
Top it off I throw on my Carolina jersey, fo' real

[Hook]
Nigga, I thought I was going To Carolina Nigga (I got it)
I coulda swore I was gunna be a Tarheel, Nigga, Dean Smith Nigga, You know?
It didn't take long though,Figured I'm not balling my nigga

[Verse 3]
Look I'm 13 now ain't shit the same
Yea nigga still hoopin' but the shit done changed
I got a new love, addicted to rhymin' it's like a new drug
Plus a nigga sick with it
I'm fuckin' whole crews up
And all hell, I started studying my idols
Pac was like Jesus, The Source was the Bible
I used to read it twice and cut the pictures out
I know my Mama wonderin', what the fuck is this about
Cause all that basketball shit on my wall was gone
Replaced it with pictures of some rappers with firearms
And plus a couple posters of bitches posing in thongs,﻿
You niggas was mowing lawns I was in here writing songs PUT ME ON
I just wanna be the best for real
I wasn't doing it for no money or no fuckin' girls
Back then I knew I was the nicest nigga in the Ville
Right now I feel like I'm the illest nigga in the world
The World world word

[Verse 1]
I got dreams of gleaming wings and Beamers
Cream so obscene
Ain't gotta clean my sneakers no mo'
A closet full of Polo
A pocket full of mo' dough
I'm knocking in the fo' door
Never stopping for the popo
I can't forget to send my momma to the Acapulco
You laugh what, can't a nigga dream big
A swimming pool, big screen, mint-green Benz
Me and Christina Milian with sixteen kids
Yeah, I joke but a nigga mean biz'
Lemme tell you how it is, nigga
I got this feeling man, a nigga finna hit the ceiling fan
Fayettevillain killing, fishing for that scrilla, reelin' in
I'm leaning
That mean I'm chilling
I'm feeling like Gilligan
Nigga what is this a barbecue?
So why the fuck you grilling then

[Verse 2]
If I'm back in the 'Ville, haters smack in they grills
Ladies like 'em; got that '80s Michael Jackson appeal
Homie curiosity, all these cats getting killed
Niggas caps gettin' peeled, for that cash niggas
Will run up on yo' ass in that mask flash and the steel
Niggas laugh when they steal
I just brag cause I'm real
Motherfucker I'm the shit
I pass gas when I feel
Shit is trash bag, it's all about the last laugh
Mad I got yo' girl turned over like a bad pass
She know I rap, so I ain't even have to bag that
Cash that? Probably not how I design rhymes
The dick got 'em singin'
I could get yo' dime signed
A Don Juan type armed with a strong pipe
I even put it on dykes
I'm smashing like it's Prom Night, bitch

[Verse 3]
You niggas must've got your marijuana laced
I know some magicians make you disappear without a trace
Out-of-state speedin' through New York with Carolina plates
I'm the God mother fucker, and how dare y'all try to hate
You'll never shine like me, you could wear your hottest Bapes
I'ma show y'all how to cake
I can tell your Prada's fake
I understand you think fly
But nigga you ain't got a cape
I understand you think you gangsta
Nigga you ain't shot a thing
Them niggas bring it to you point-blank range, ain't gotta aim
Yeah, you see some players shooting, but this shit is not a game
Badda boom, badda bang
Lot of goons, lot of lames
Old groupie-ass niggas like the clan
Tryna hang, yeah
By the way, since ninety-seven I been nice
I'm finna get it crackin' like fat niggas on thin ice, wooh



[Chorus]
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The C.R.E.A.M. is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with

[J. Cole - Verse 1]
Yo, Tasha, a fox but, been round the block cause niggas jock her
The wannabe model she dating mobsters
Been involved with street kids to kingpins
Got a thing for the bad boys
Thats how she meets him, see him is cat named "Black"
Real name Jack James, stacks change
Real big in the crack game
She’s seen that Range and she’s seen that chain
The bling made the dame wanna give up her last name
She was wit, but he was pimp like, just like Ike was
Treated her like it was the Fight Club
Hit her with rights, blood drippin’ on white rug
By the end of the night, they would kiss and she was iced up
Long as he kept her iced up, she piped down
Hit her off with a little pipe to mic bounce
Down south where a nigga wouldn’t return for days or weeks
She was too afraid to cheat
So you ain't even gotta ask
As long as she got a Prada bag
Or an Armani exchange skirt showing a lot of ass
She’s good, living the life, she’s ballin’
Too bad she picked the wrong nigga to get involved with
See the nigga black had problems and enemies
And snake niggas is friends only pretend to be
And cats is out for his head, he caught in some shit
Just watch how Tasha gets tossed in the mix

[Chorus]
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The C.R.E.A.M. is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with

[J. Cole - Verse 2]
Now Black owed money and when it comes to this money, trust me
You can’t tip toe with nobody cause
Niggas will do insane things to get they cream
Won’t even speak, let the bullets explain things
Thats how it is, paybacks a bitch, right?
Especially if you didn’t pay back niggas is sick like
Run up in your crib like “bitch where’s the bread at?”
“You got a week to get it, dont got it, you’ll regret it”
Funny I said it cause Jack’s in the same exact predicament
Got a foot in the grave and still digging it
Owe some niggas money with no intentions of giving it
Them niggas is sending warnings, he isn’t listening
Tomorrow morning they buss in his front door
And a swarm of muthafuckers with guns drawn coming at
On the hunt for Black, Tasha gets smacked
But Jack’s gone a whole week before he gets back but
Niggas is through waiting, they been too patient already
They ain't recieved a fucking penny
So they called a nigga up
Told him if he doesnt get the dough
And give it up n the next 6 hours, his bitch is fucked
But, hold up!
The nigga Black answers with “So What!”
“I gives a fuck, shoot the ho up, still won’t show up”
Hung the phone up, toss it back and she knew
Sorry baby girl, this is what cheddar can do!
(2 silenced gun shots)



[Intro]
J. Cole
Haha uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, Yo
Bear with a nigga man
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?
I'll still kill it nigga
Show y'all niggas how it do
Real Quick

[Verse 1]
Uh You know what they say;
The window to the soul is in the eyes
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blinds
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the Super Soakers
I got 'em so wet
Fuck that Moet, I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking
Nervous? nigga, please
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, its like a nigga be baking
Watch so cold, it's like the shit will need blankets
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones
Hit and run, bigger funds
But still can't forget to pour liquor
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny
So I do what's best for me
I know you fake niggas well, ain't no test to me
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe for that
So nigga chill or the tec will speak, "Blaaat!"
Them niggas will put you chest to feet
I'm talking reckless
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted
Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us
Looking for model divas that barely speak English
Fuck 'em while we rich, cuz when we broke, they gonna leave us
We earn stripes, looking like zebras
Y'all looking like Adidas
We do it for the streets, cuz they need us
Got beef? Come meet us
Ok I thought so
Y'all niggas are so mad cuz I floss so bad on bitches
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso
Make her stomach feel the fossil
Now she yelling out God so much thought I had her singing gospel
Shit, shout out to my apostles
Ya know me
Nicest nigga in the south
Yea you can quote me!

[Outro]
Wooo Shit!
Haha
Ooooh Shit, mother fucker!
Hahaha
Oohh Shit
And I'm sick bitch, holla at me!
You know!
Fuck boy!!



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
The game need balance, the game need balance
Woke up this morning to the rumors of niggas wilding
Picture me hating on a young nigga with talent
Album flop, but it's cool, he caked out on his allowance
I was out in Vegas, Kicks was the latest
Bitch was the baddest, her head was the greatest
Only one thing that I ask of you haters
You can't diss a nigga if you got him on your playlist
From straight A's to A-list, Only niggas with AK's can play this
My Jordan's thirteen like eighth grade, You niggas debaters
But you ignoring my pay raise
I made it from 8 dollars an hour, that's 400 a week
To 100 grand a show, that's 400 a week
Ice and wrist, It's Cole summer to keep
Life's a bitch, Just don't cum in the sheets



[Intro]
Yeah Yeah, uh Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Carolina, nigga
Fayettenam, nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is for them street niggas to them deep niggas
Them politics, them geek niggas
To them freak bitches that swallow dick, it's real
Or them sheep niggas in Prada shit and still
Even them bleak niggas without a cent could feel
I never sleep nigga, I gotta get them mills
I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the ville
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill
Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third
My shit in every street, like the curb
So bitches wanna meet cause I'm deep with my words
So them niggas wanna peep like a perv
But peep game
Before they start saying "He changed"
A real nigga can never forget where he came
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train
I throw it up!
Yeah

[Hook]
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up
Yeah, Chi town throw it up (yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
As you niggas smoking more kush
South niggas run you niggas, ask George Bush
Ask Bill Clinton, a nigga Will Smithin'
My jeans a 'lil less baggy, money still fittin.'
The streets a lil less rowdy, but they still kickin'
Them Randy Johnson O.G. niggas still pitchin'
And yeah, I know she got a man, but I'm still hittin'
So when he be up in that shit, he be like 'This feels different, "
No shit, throw dick like the veteran I am
I got that vitamin D, it's like medicine to them
I got her climaxing like it's never finna end
That's why she fucking me a lot better than her man
She try a new trick, she so wet a nigga swam
Like a salmon in this bitch, my dick drowning in that shit
They love a fly nigga on that frisbee shit
Plus a nigga get Gs like them Disney flicks
I throw it up!
Yea

[Hook]
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up
Yeah, Chi town throw it up (yeah)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Real niggas want the money, so that's where my aim is
Ho niggas love the attention, wanna be famous
Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)
But that's the price when you nice with it
And them ladies gonna like cause you light-skinned
I take advantage of the situation
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania
They catch feelings and I switch next
"I made it clear baby, just sex
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed! "
Even them white girls tryna be my princess
But I only fuck with sisters like incest
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press
I sense death in the air, but it's nothing for me
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that chick
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch
You better hit up homocide, I just killed that shit, boy!

[Outro]
Throw it up nigga!
Throw Throw it, Throw it up!
Yeah!



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed
Never met death, well, at least not yet
Off to the place where they rest under flowers
Niggas get wetter, like sex in the shower
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?
I know the world is going to come to an ending
Before it does can finish up my sinning?
I see the devil grinning, as if he was winning
This is the bottom of the ninth inning
I'm coming back like light skinned
What a sad sight, looking at my gas light
Like "Damn man, I just threw 10 in"
Look five dollars won't get you what it use too
And look, love don't mean what it use too
And everybody and their mommas on youtube
Is it just me, or is this unusual?
Don't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll
So let me slow down, to the beat ya'll
Put the remote down, move your feet dawg
One time for the niggas holding heat ya'll
Keep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt
See me, I rather cut catch her body give birth
If you were the last nigga walking on earth
Turn yourself and clap your hands like this was church

[Hook: J. Cole]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I say money make the girls go down
They say money make the world go 'round
So my broke niggas, ain't it a shame
If Bill Gates made it rain
Then world goin' drown
Can I get a dollar?
Shawty got a low Impala
Made that ass drop, hydrola', holla!
Know she got a man, and I don't understand
Why he don't grab that bitch by the collar
Follow, look uh
I need my women a little hood
Living in a world where bad means good
That explains why the bad hoes attract 'em
That explains why the bad rappers go platinum
Or gold these days, go DJ
If the world stops spinning like a old DJ
Keep playing, I need a little more time
Pre paying, just a few more dimes
We slaying, keep praying, hoping
2012? You gotta be joking!
Ain't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign
But +The Whole World+ done lost they minds
Look, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville
This is not a test, this is not a drill
This is all real so before we all kill
Let me get one more feel. Baby!

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Lil Cole]
Yeah, hey
Duck motherfuckers, run for your lives motherfucker
It's Lil Cole nigga. hahaha
The world is coming to an end nigga (It's coming to an end motherfucker, haha)
It's coming to an end trust me
I see it all revelation motherfuckers, all that shit
It's Lil Cole, you know I'm going in straight in to heaven nigga, holla at me

[Bridge x2]
Earthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes
You meaner than Katrina baby I gotta know your name
Before this thing is over this might be the last song
For the man upstairs put the lights on and shut this party down

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like



[Intro]
Yea Yea, uh
It's Carolina, nigga
Yeah
Ay
Fayettenam
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Listen, alive and still kickin nigga
I survived the ville
But a lot will not, so they wield Glocks and Bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill
Money hungry, tryna find a meal
Can't stay inside and chill
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas
Lying like they on the pill
Preachers say we blessed
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel gates
My mind is still- racing, I'm tryna kill- snakes
Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
Yeah

Yo, Coming home, y'all
Listen
At any given time, got the city on my mind
The city on my mind
The city on my mind
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
At any given time, Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine
I'm tryna go for mine

Hey
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show
Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose
Money goes, the money come
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks
The Carolina way
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say
Cause in Carolina- we thorough
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G-boro
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yea
Yo, coming home nigga!

[Verse 2: Deacon]
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like
Ooh!
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'
Blew game and I do my thing
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring
Oh no!
Riding with my niggas for the weekend
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
Ooh!



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know you're just doing your job, no mean to disrespect ya
But we been going through this thing since way back
I told ya when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby (yeah, if you only knew)
I got bigger problems baby
So while ya talk about the money that I owe like it's as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothin' to me
Cause right now I got my lil boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could ya please stop fuckin' wit me?
Listen here I ain't lookin' for no tears, but my brother got a year and my moma keep smokin' that shit
On top of that I'm broke, please put that in your notes for the next one to call me up talkin' that shit

[Hook: B.o.B]
So life don't pass me by, cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by
Cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Mr. Policeman
Am I wrong, ain't you supposed to keep the peace, man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh na, I get it, I get it, I get it)
Or cause I'm black, hmm, maybe?
Tell me why my hands start sweating and I hold my breathe every time you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pull me over, ya frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me, what do you see?
Thug niggas, drug-dealers its a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mothafuckin' college degree

[Hook: B.o.B]
So life don't pass me by, cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by
Cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
My middle finger to the law, bustin' off, tryin' to touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'mma fuckin' try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, we don't make the news
Instead they talk about some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fuckin' a these white hoes
Anchorman stop snitchin'
Cut to commercial, he be textin' all his side bitches
Hey ma-goodness, how ironic
I'm tryed for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your Honor, is you kidding, how you sit above me?
Are you perfect mothafucka? How you finna to judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is Bad Boys, they be just like Puff
They hate their jobs and their days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us

[Hook: B.o.B]
So life don't pass me by, cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by
Cause sometimes it'll leave ya stuck, don't ask me why (why)
Gotta keep this train-a-movin', no time to cry (cry)
So lonely days I say goodbye (bye)
Gotta live for today so life it won't pass me by



[Verse 1]
Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain’t no mystery why there picking me for
I’ve been hot since ’97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I’m skinny, didn’t eat so I’m hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it’s funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn’t get on
One time for my city bitch I’m putting it on
Like a condom when I’m with your girl, ballin’ like it’s intramural
Back in middle school, hoopin’ to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminisce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn’t nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn’t make it past flirting
Now I’m taking baths with their naked ass jerkin
"Make It Last Forever" playing in the background
You can take it as whatever I was laying that down
She gon' hate my ass forever, I ain't bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them text'es, spillin all your stresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast’es
I never disrespected, I’m clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don’t wanna fuck him, now they wanna f-ckin’ like him
And hope he fucking wife em

[Break]
Yeah, nuttin’ like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin’ jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can’t impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh apparently, some of y’all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don’t care to see
Don’t make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your new favorite rapper embarrassed, see
I’m the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don’t wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I’m dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs. Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y’all gotta shed me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me, nigga
Yeah, yeh



[Verse 1]
Yeah, hey!
Hey, I'm just a Carolina nigga goin' hard for the 'Ville
I ain't seen six figures but I feel like a mill'
Cause I'm fresh up off the deal, will I chill? Never that!
I'm the hottest nigga out and you could tell the devil that
Got that crack! Went from pebble to that Roc, pedal that
So much bass, I mean niggas can't tell where the treble at
On the track, niggas can't keep up, they look, they trailin' back
Now these bustas couldn't catch up even if Id pedal back
Won't lose, bet on that! or be in debt forever
Plus whatever Jigga say, I'm hot
That's like the pot called kettle black
Now these industry niggas like damn, "Jay said all that? "
Same niggas could've signed me, now they gon regret all that
Bet on that! Bitch, this my beat, look how I get on that shit
I'm on it like I own it cus I sewn it
Needle and thread, hip-hop heads know them drums express youself
Aye look, I tried to school these niggas, they need extra help
I mean they just don't get the message dawg, no text could help
And now I'm on some 'fuck you niggas', go molest yourself
I'm tryna ball til I fall, catch myself, then ball again
Fall to the floor, dust myself, do it all again
Pardon him, sick nigga, never been a bitch nigga
Spit it for them ones like me who never been a rich nigga
Had the dream to make a team and get up off the bench nigga
You fuckin' with me, ya odds is slimma then a stick figure
Get bigga nigga

[Hook]
Hey, blood, sweat and tears, I paid my price
Hey, so come and get this good game
Aye you should come and get this good game
Hey, hey
I pray for days and nights I gave my life
Hey, so you can come and get this good game
Think you should come and get this good game
Hey heeyy

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm just a down south nigga, lil' east coast flow
From the concrete jungle where the trees don't grow
From the 'Ville, where the motherfuckin' streets so cold
Nigga I could show you streets where police won't go
We just tryna get a piece, my nigga we so po'
Why you lookin' at him, wonderin' why he sold dope
Or why she smoke crack? Or why he tote gats?
Gotta stay up on your toes cus if your feet both flat
A nigga heat gon' clap, your heartbeat go flat
The Lord giveth and he taketh, well he repo'ed that
They don't quiver, they don't shake, man they just reload gats
So much beef for a nigga to have a feast on that
Now a nigga like myself ain't had to keep no gat
But nowadays mo'fuckers is weak, won't scrap
So them OG's tell a nigga, "Please, roll strapped"
It's fucked up a nigga man it be's like that
It be's like that (Hey) and it be's like that (Hey)
Them boys from the 'Ville and yeah it be's like that

[Hook]



[Intro]
Uh yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

[Hook]
What am I here for?
I'm a man so I cannot let them tears fall
But understand trynna get my head clear ya'll
This shit is on my mind
Asking for the lord to show me all my signs
Show me something
Cause I'm trynna find something
I'm lost can you show me something
I'm lost can you show me something

[Verse 1]
I sit and reminisce on them niggas no longer here
And how I used to hit the mall and ya was always there
I sit and think how I didn't grow up with my father there
No need to cry cause it only made me stronger yea
I watched my brother get in trouble with the law and yea
That shit cut me like I was sitting in a barber chair
Cause I don't want to see them locked up in them bars in there
And I don't want to see him stretched out in a coffin yea
I'm wishing I can move my momma out so far from here
I know that she deserve much better and she worked hard as hell
That's why you never see me settle cause they want us here
I'm trynna side step the devil but he heartless yea
But just know that I'm a rebel and yo it's almost here
I'm talking bout the revolution I am Paul Revere
So dry your eyes momma please you can pause them tears
Cause I promise I'm gon get us outta here
I'm gon get us outta here

[Hook]
What am I here for?
I'm a man so I cannot let them tears fall?
But understand trynna get my head clear ya'll this shit is on my mind
Asking for the lord to show me all my signs
Show me something
Cause I'm trynna find something
I'm lost can u show me something
I'm lost can you show me something

[Verse 2]
I swear I'm praying for my niggas when I say grace
I know them niggas don't care who they hit they spray strays
But lord please protect my family cause if they graze
Niggas is loading up that ammi and them A-K's
I know it's wrong and that revenge is all in your hands
But last night I heard they robbed and killed an old man
Now if they cold enough to take a life that's innocent
I know that they could give a fuck whether I live and shit
And so I'm asking you if you can hold me down lord
Be my umbrella-ella-ella in this downpour
I know you never ever ever let me drown or
Won't let that devil ever ever win this round naw
And though I stray for you, you know that my heart is good
And I know I ain't exactly living how I probly should
And I'm a try to act better like it's Hollywood
Niggas congratulate me I just tell them God is good
God is good

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yea, huh, yea my niggas drug dealing in the trap
I'm tellin you wake up nigga it's a trap
You set up and to them young mothers fed up
Just keep your head up
Don't let up
You fall you get up
You make your bed up that you sleep in
Fake rappers ain't practicing what dey preaching
Hey tell you hit the trap while they relaxing on the beach and
I'm here to spit the facts
A nigga backflipped off the deep end
I smell this shit for what it is
Not kells but I love the kids
And so I make the song to let em know that they important
Cause them racist teachers couldn't give a fuck bout wat they score is
So they try to get them hands up on them Grants like Horace
Now slanging for you knoe it cops is knocking they got warrants
Damn!, uh, and how he running for it
Damn!, yea and now the cops is running for him damn!
And now he finally slowing down
Hands behind your head, lay down on the ground, nigga

[Hook]



I'm drivin', nigga as soon as I get the text we all in the car like, "Ahh, yeah nigga, we out here nigga, yeah nigga!!" So we goin' crazy, we goin' crazy as fuck, we like super excited. Dog, ten seconds later, all I see in the back and hear is "woop woop," blue lights right behind me, the fuckin' undercover car, of all things. So I'm like fuck. I knew right away what it was. Dawg, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New York, I was drivin' dirty, my license was no good. Dawg, how 'bout the moment I found out I was gon' get the deal a fuckin' cop got behind me and I already knew what it was. I handled it so like, I handled it the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin', bitch like, ah know what I'm sayin'? I'm in there dog, spendin' the night in jail realizin', like, these niggas have no clue, bitch I'm 'bout to sign this shit (laughs). That was the easiest night in jail a nigga could ever do, son

Live from the city of dreams
You see I wrote and bag this dope in hopes of prettier things
If hope floats I took the boat up to the city of Queens
But phony niggas showed me quick this ain't the city of scenes
Hey! Fish out of water from the city of the dreamers
When young niggas feinding for them big body beamers
They told us we can have the world if I can get a deal
Maybe I could show the Ville that it's real

I put this on everything, I love
This is, my sweat and uhh my blood
(Who's world is this) You know it's mine
Boy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind
(Who's world is this) I'm gon ball
And uhh I'm gon shine and uhh I won't fall
(Who's world is this) I thought I told you this is my world baby
(It's mine, it's mine, it's mine)

Hey, straight out the Ville and I made it, hope you feeling my latest
Ayy what I spit on these pages highly anticipated, contagious
So when I spit it you gonna get it
Slightly different from these rappers who just spit but don't live it, see
I ain't no flashy nigga so don't expect me to floss
These niggas out here rappin with their fucking fingers crossed
I was a dreamer then I came up with a plan
Where I land I put it all on gods hands

I put this on everything, I love
This is, my sweat and uhh my blood
(Who's world is this) You know it's mine
Boy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind
(Who's world is this) I'm gon ball
And uhh I'm gon shine and uhh I won't fall
(Who's world is this) I thought I told you this is my world baby

And I feel like I got a loong way to go
And still I got a loong way to go
Feel like I got a loong way to go



[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do
Uhh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

[Hook]
Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha
Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha
Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[J. Cole]
I'm tryna get with ya girl, I ain't even going stunt
Miss Fat booty, man I seen it from the front
I mean that shit was pumped, had me fiending from the jump
And that ass was right, shit would make a fag look twice
So I approach like “shawty , whats good with cha?”
Nigga was hopin’ to go back to the hood with ya
And yeah I see them other niggas tryna look at cha
Wouldn’t slang the thing right even if they could get ya
Me I’m from the Ville where we learn how to mack well
And you gon’ yell when I hit it from the back well
Take you to the crib and throw on a little Maxwell
Grab a condom know cause, shit, I don’t know you that well
Haa, was fucking with that
Far from hater but see dem brothers was wack
So don’t you worry bout them mean muggin’ girl
I’m tougher than that
And niggas mad cause this light skinned brotha is back
I’m sayin’ though

[Hook & Interlude]

[J. Cole]
Stripes on the Polo
On the late night, fucking your wife on the low low
My pipe like a pogo stick, no homo
No ice but I’m cold though
Cologne on my nuts in case she might wanna go low
I’m from the Ville where niggas fight for the dolo
So think twice or take the same advice from the fo’fo’
Me running to PoPo and muthaf-ckin’ no go
A Carolina nigga, I’m the muthaf-ckin logo
Shit, fly as hell on my ozone shit
Disrespect me nigga you could get your cornroll split
And that goes for you too, I’m on my Bono shit
Niggas got no delivery thats that Digiorno shit
I got porno chicks callin’, I still neglect them nigga
I’m about my money like a bill collector
For you slow niggas I put it more in laymans
If you ain't talkin’ money its a foreign language
But uh, shawty can I get wit cha

[Hook]

What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain

[Verse]

The city fucked up, even thug niggas getting robbed
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station
Filling out them applications, but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Paychecks spent on necklaces
Downpayments on them lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft, with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimists
Cause ain't no holding me back
The lil' nigga had big dreams, to do big things
But in this game, everything ain't what this shit seems
Try hard, to climb up to the flag-pole
Just to find out that your heroes is some assholes

[Hook] (x2)

But ain't no holding me back
I'mma get mine, believe that
Aye what's sunshine with no rain
Aye what's joy without the pain
Man I'm still gon' do my thang



[Verse 1]
Runnin' from cops, for hundreds of blocks
Like Short Dawg before he stumbled
And dropped
Gun in my crotch and its unloaded
I just toat it for fun hoping that one day
They catch me on camera like Gunplay
Gunbutting motherfuckers that's one way
To sell a album
Need all the help I can get
Cause on this shelf that I sit, its real lonely
My fans do they still want me?
They waitin', I am fightin' satan
He think I am his lil homie
These stories are metaphors
They hold a deeper message for those who fed up
Hoping you had my life instead of yours
They say the grass is always greener
The pussy's always cleaner on the other side
Until you mow the lawn with gonorrhea
And you realize you had it better
Way before the cheddar came
Looking back I wanted your respect and never fame
But you know the saying right Jermaine
Careful what you ask for
Cause even when you was mad poor
At least laughed more
Never thought I'd still be proving myself on my sophomore
I understand its been a year and a half since my last tour
But things have changed since I last seen the ring
But the one who seem to claim that he the king got a glass jaw
And I'mma break this shit
Cole World no handkerchief

[Interlude: (Charlamagne Tha God)]
Two classics....
Ahhh fuck, fuck me I was about to go off
(Well at least you wasn't reading off a blackberry
You know I was about to ask you about wondering)

[Verse 2]
Two classics and I am Kobe Bryant on some Laker shit
Fighting to make the playoffs
Writing and taking no day offs
I'm on fire like money hungry company lay offs
No pink slips if loose lips sink ships
Then God dammit ahhhh fuck these niggas Titanics
I am joking, only provoking
In hopes to go number one again
Hoping some rappers disses me just to make this shit fun again
It's no fair
Pac had Mobb Deep and Biggie
And I get left with is Tyrese and Diggy
This is bullshit



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Fast lane, looking bad thang with them brains
From the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I’m high as God
Why is it Lord that I can’t seem to slow the whip down?
The same boy standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don’t follow rules
Carter blues, nigga hold up, y’all still don’t got a clue
Yeah, all the cool niggas from high school that still ain’t doing shit
‘Member when y’all used to fuck niggas till they blue and shit?
Now your ass broke as a joke and them niggas doing it
Funny how the tables turned and life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy ‘less he need a dollar from his baby mama
And y’all still don’t wear a condom, is you stupid nigga?
Falling in love with these hoes, is you Cupid nigga?
You better learn ‘fore you burn boy, see me stay on top of my game, David Stern boy
Did this dirt like worms, now my mom was more concerned with the future
Y’all niggas stuck in neutral, this a city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya, I’m here to get ya higher baby so this here the booster
I’m tryna be the king, this that Martin Luther
Shit is crucial, now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ‘Ville, still pourin' liquor ‘fore my niggas killed

[Verse 2: XV]
Look, it’s too bad that he’s too good
Never giving up but it’s sad that you would
My crew like a couple of clansmen, too hood
And when it came to putting on Kansas, who would?
Vizzy, no trying, couple figures on and I’m sitting on Bryants
Game started buzzing so I’m sitting on hydrants
Nah Joe, I’m highjack, you can call me a Somali pirate
All black wallet, inside Irish, mean it’s all green
Yeah, I’m mean with this fly shit, they buzzing like bees in a high nest
Girls getting on they knees for your highness
And I’m running these streets, no bright vest
Stick to the paper, damn, I’m a fly catch
I’m tryna live more, die less and if you tryna get yours, holla X, XV
You should OD off of this rhyme ‘cause I’mma change minds like cold feet
In store for a meal, groceries but they be like “We don’t normally come out at night mostly”
Go and get your rosaries ‘cause I’m about kill this, no halo like Sony
And if your girl a little horse like a pony, ahem, well of course, start pointing
Fly Boy Club, well of course I’m soaring, always gonna
Always be in the air like Jordan
And they always gonna stare, just ignore ‘em
Now you with the X man, I’mma call you Storm
I’m touring her, under that hood and um it’s foreign up under that hood and um
I feel like a dude this cool should feel so I guess I feel good and um XV, J.Cole, we in

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Busting, I'm going off, sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me, these hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club, you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God but to me, she found Satan
She only getting hotter, what's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said “That's cool nigga but can you buy the Benz?”
She playing niggas like a violin, I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day’s found, this is my playground

[Verse 4: XV]
Look, I’mma spit it from the top of the dome, don’t normally do this
But I’m feeling real cool, I am ruthless, like Eazy-E was, I am toothless
Like that one fiend was, I am killing shit like I never do this
I never do this but I’m gonna spit it straight from the top oh
And I know niggas done heard about Kansas but I’m about to do this motherfucker
I done ran shit since ‘02 and I was like oh and y’all niggas don’t know
I’m about to prove man what everything that I’m doing is about to do a movement
X to the V, who you booing? Look, I don’t even do this normally but I’mma do this
Accordingly, cordially, I am dope, yes dude
I have never wrote this shit down in my head
I have spoke shit you that never ever said
‘Cause I’m dope, y’all niggas dead, fresh, chill nigga, I am gonna get this
X to the V, y’all niggas witness, I’m about to throw ‘em back, ruler this
Y’all niggas doing this, y’all niggas know that I’m moving shit
And if you don’t know it right now, google it, I’m about to be on every blog
Doing shit, I’m about to do this shit like E told me do, look, look, I don’t know

[Verse 5: J.Cole]
What do I gotta do to prove to you I’m not the dude for you to just try to fool with?
Niggas ain’t got a clue bitch, niggas wanna bullshit
Don’t know that my crew thinking that these cute bitches we normally knocking boots with
Too slick to grip, my nigga should stop that
That verse was so old that I done forgot that
But now I come off the top with the hot raps
Niggas know you better stop that
Coming through, got the Glock cocked back
Nigga I ain’t even got one
Nigga, I’m aiming at your face with the shotgun
Lyrically, spiritually
Niggas tryna mirror me but I’m vampire and I’m so damn higher than the average nigga
Can you get witcha ya? I just signed with Jigga, nigga how high you figure?
Damn, I’m slipping up on my words but my verbs so sick that I never slip
Niggas know uh-uh, please save me XV

[Verse 6: XV]
They be like Vizzy on some other shit, on his MCDs ‘cause they loving it
Pockets fat like the Klumps in it, my flow is something sick, no asking
Proactive couldn’t stop bumping it, nowadays I be on some other shit
Ladies think I’m gone kinda like my upper lip, wrong
Like a broken condom, pause, ‘cause Hoff go raw
It’s something you really shouldn’t be fucking with
Came through whipping, paint still dripping
They say like Sheneneh, oh no you didn’t
Know that one saying when your palm start itching?
Well mine do some much, I had to start to wear mittens
And you think that I’m kidding, if I don’t slow down
They gon’ think that I’m driven, if I don’t go down, she gon’ think I hate fishing
Chill for a minute and I was like listen, Vizzy, gettin’, gettin’, gettin’
Y’all motherfuckers know I’m about to spit it straight up off the top of the dome again
How this nigga doing that? He be going in, I don’t even know shit
I be just blowing shit, I don’t even smoke and shit, how you know this?
By enrolling it, I don’t even know I got a backpack on
If you see me, take a flick of me and you niggas gonna blow the shit
‘Cause you were pointing at me like he gonna blow and shit
And them niggas be knowing it, if I be doing this shit all around the world and shit
All around the globe with it, man y’all niggas spit it in, I just get it in
Flow out here and manager from Switzerland, nigga from Kansas
And y’all niggas whipping it, how you motherfuckers doing it?



Fuck it
Ay
Do or Die, new arrival
Holla at my niggas
You survive you's alive, yo
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto
Money coming soon, the newest model
Your crew is hollow
The type of niggas gobble dick, chew and swallow
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts" uh
More sluts once the money blows up
But them hoes stop if the dough drops
I won't stop though, a chip off the ole' block
I'm from a city where niggas hold blocks
Leave you looking like old socks, damn
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us
The boys is rotten, I know they want us
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus
You kill a nigga, get promoted
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas
So much I just go nuts
Niggas telling me slow up
Never that
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at
Y'all don't hear me
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks, "
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo
They got streets in the city police won't even go
Peep it though, uh
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh
Niggas know my style though, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though
Have your daddy looking for you
This ain't Finding Nemo though
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

[Verse 2: J. Cole]

Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth
Now, if you was the last man walking on Earth
Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church
Hey…and clap for him…



[Verse 1]
Aye nigga I'm the best man
As if my best friend was getting married
Even with my eyes closed I'm something like a visionary
Paint you a perfect picture, nigga this is pictionary
Man they goin' have to put my picture in the dictionary
Right next to real then put your picture right next to fictionary
Claiming that you trill but you want bitches, all you niggas scary
Don't try to hide from it, oh boy we see you
Claim you goin' ride, oh no we don't believe you
Help wanted, classified, you need more people
Hating mind, I'm greater sign, hey we are no equal
My life is like a movie you like 3 or 4 previews
This the city where they glad to see your soul leave you
You're body laid back like neil so evil
Cole world baby 3 below zero
Getcha life snatched and your vehicle repo
I bring it to you live you gon' see it no TiVo

[Hook]
We on (nigga)
We on (cole world)
We on (cole world nigga)
We on
We on

[Verse 2]
Look man I'm tryna count money like a CFO you see us ho
Doing shows with hoes speaking languages that we don't know
Look here man, if love is blind then these bitches can't see no mo'
They fucking with the boy like a pedophile
If she won't go then we goin' roll cause J. Cole got a mean old flow
I looked up to some niggas but they ain't fuckin with me no more
Chip on my shoulder like I just left the casino oh
Nigga I been broke so don't hate me cause you don't see no dough
Hip-Hop was like Santa Claus cause no body believed no more
And then I came around, now nigga watch me paint the town
A lil black, a lil brown, a lil white, we a mess
This is Carolina repping you can check-in, be our guest
Me I'm blessed, shout to Khaled while I'm howlin' we da best
All these corny rap niggas tryna be my BFF
Nigga please, go head with that old bullshit you rhymin'
See this that good music, so we ain't got shit in common nigga

[Hook]



Nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that don shit
Dom Pérignon shit
Not gon' cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling
Bout as sweet as a jumper on a gay Ray Allen
I’m bout fucking hoes like Ray J wilding
Killing niggas like KKK violence
I guess it why they pay homage
Momma I’ma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace



[Verse 1]
Hey
Yeah, uh
Yeah
Lost in the world like Siddhartha while I author these quotes
Cutting hoes like a varsity coach
Caught fire no Larceny, please you gotta pardon these boasts
A lot of niggas pray to god that he choke
Never see the album drop Fall off and be broke
Reminiscing on the hard times, so often he'd hoped to slip his foot in the door
Promise when I made it I’d write my hooks for the poor
But now I'm hella Faded and got my foot to the floor while I'm pushing this Porsche
Seem to be more concerned with how I look in the Source
Staring in the mirror just to see a look of remorse
Take a look at my chain, look at what I've became!

[Selah Sue]
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say this' my song for you, my friend
And you can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no oh yeah
So listen to the sound of my voice
Your brothers sending all my love
Is giving me no choice no no no
Listen to the sound of the point, ha!
Raggamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handeling a choice and I know, that

[Hook]
Dear raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end
What you ever gonna gonna do I dunno
Dear raggamuffin shall not fall down

What is a good sense under ya ground yes

[Verse 2: Selah Sue]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, that old me that you knew well is still in me Somewhere
Deep down there
Hiding in the corner is a nigga who cared
Believed he could change the world, and he did
Now he sits alone Used to write poems
But that's gone it's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair, and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stay, or will I ride

[Hook]
Dear raggamuffin is one of the band
What you see is what you really need in the end
What you ever gonna gonna do I dunno
(rap, rap, rap)
Dear raggamuffin shall not fall down
Cause he has the wisdom of a not fool around
What is a good sense under ya ground yeah

No, no, no, yeah



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that’s flattering but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y’all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, ask me if I gained weight, I said nah
My pockets got fatter, that’s all
Money was an issue but now that that’s solved, I ball, I ball
Like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantel
Dawg my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me
How that feel? Very happy (very happy)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Cole World, Boy, check the degree’s
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze
That’s why I blew up on you sucka’s all thats left is debris
One soldier’s all that’s left is fatigues
Act like you know me boy, I’m Kobe
How the fuck you gon step in my league
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling?
‘Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen
I’m ’bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin’
Killin’ niggas like K K K violence
I guess it’s why they pay homage
Momma I’mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..
Whatever man

[Beat Change]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin’
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin’
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin’
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown huntin’
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin’ like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peatin’
And I’m knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin’
The label heat seekin’, nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin’
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

[Break]
I’m heavy
I’m heavy
Man these niggas get exlusives
Hey, hey

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Man, I’m already hot, you can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your’s “be seated”
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin’ out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinkin’ I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fuckin’ bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just happy he made it
My money was running late now, now it’s happy belated
I’m heavy, nigga I’m heavy



[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Verse 1]
Feel like I lived for this moment
I see it in their eyes, them other guys don't want it
My style they can crown it, but can't dethrone it
I was aiming for the top and now I I I'm on it
What a powerful performance
I was in my zone, send flowers for opponents
Tell 'em "Get well soon"
Cause I ain't in the mood
So if you read that word backwards then it should spell 'doom'
I'm on fire, y'all can inhale fumes, as I zoom by ya
As you thinking, 'Who's higher?'
Fueled by a desire you should admire
That's why I'm what they aspire to be 'fore they retire
A livin' legend, with God givin' blessings
And game so cold they probably watching this in Heaven
Expecting the incredible, so baby watch me do that
And make the Angels say 'Lord, how he do that?'

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Verse 2]
A champion's mentality
And so I'm scoring, ignoring the fact you're fouling me
And one, where I go you can't come
I was schooling your father boy, that make you my grandson
I've been around the block twice, now my shot nice
No referee but best believe out here I got stripes
Now that they finally consider me a legit scorer
Would you believe I started off as a bench-warmer?
Have me feelin' like Master Splinter
Now the haters and commentators say 'there's a winner'
Hey, hard work pay off, now I don't take a day off
I rest not, I guess that's why your best shot? Way off
These are the things that dreams are made of
The sweep, no time for sleep, when you're elite
If what you reap is what you sow, then what was you expecting?
Expect to come in second
While I become a legend

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Outro]
Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here
I guess I'll see you when you get here

Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here
I guess I'll see you when you get here

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply



Recently there’s been a trend that includes rappers saying something offensive, only to be attacked for it in the media and pressured to apologize. I have to be completely honest and say there’s a part of me that resents that. I view rap similar to how I view comedy. It’s going to ruffle feathers at times. It’s going to go “too far”. I do not believe that an apology is needed every time someone is offended, especially when that apology is really only for the sake of saving an endorsement or cleaning up bad press.

With that said, this is not the case today. This letter is sincere.
This apology IS necessary.

In a recent verse on the song “Jodeci Freestyle”, I said something
highly offensive to people with Autism. Last week, when I first saw a comment from someone outraged about the lyric, I realized right away that what I said was wrong. I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant enough say something so hurtful. What makes the crime worse is that I should have known better.

To the entire Autism community who expressed outrage, I’m moved and inspired by your passion, and I’m amazed at how strong you are as a unit. I have now read stories online from parents about their struggles and triumphs with raising an Autistic child and I admire how incredibly strong you have to be to do so. It’s touching. It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real shame. You have every right to be angry.

To anyone suffering from Autism, either mildly or severely, I am sorry. I’m bound to make mistakes in my life, but in my heart I just want to spread Love.

I want to educate myself more on Autism, and I’ll gladly own my mistake and serve as an example to today’s generation that there’s nothing cool about mean-spirited comments about someone with Autism. People with this disorder and their loved ones have to go through so much already, the last thing they need is to hear something as ignorant as what I said. I understand.

To the parents who are fighting through the frustrations that must
come with raising a child with severe autism, finding strength and
patience that they never knew they had; to the college student with Asperger’s Syndrome; to all those overcoming Autism. You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere apology.

Much Love

-Cole

[Verse 1]
Bustin, I'm going off
Sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp
Like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me
These hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God, but to me she found Satan
She only getting hotter
What's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said: "That's cool nigga
But can you buy the Benz? "
She playin’ niggas like a violin
I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day's found
This is my playground

[Hook]
This is a playground
But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound
Hey now, hey, this is a playground
But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would you lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound
Hey now, hey this is a playground

[Verse 2]
This is a playground, merry-go-round
Like a dream for a nigga
But I swing on a nigga if he push me
I'm makin' moves like the Rutgers
These ain't no monkey bars motherfucker, not a sucker
But these labels throw me deals like the prosecution
Want to underpay me and fuck me like its prostitution
I write that constitution, you know, that classic shit
How you going to own my masters
And you ain't mastered shit?
Give them my ass to kiss, my lawyer laughed at this
Said they was on some bullshit when they drafted this
Like MJ, so I wagged a finger like Dikembe
Until you niggas talking proper paper, no comprende
And now the deals got mills like Wendy's
And got these labels doing bids like inmates
Hoping my pen lays my name down
Until that day's found, this is my playground

[Refrain]

Top, top top, top of the world!

Uh!
I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)

[A.L.]
Uh!
First off, uh, rest in peace Track Willie
Ridin' with me cus, back then nobody pulled for me (Whoo!)
Now I sit back reclined and shine it's all fine
Cus the flow merit status was before my time
I remember daydreamin' when I bust like the semen
Of a heater, said the truth and nobody believed him (Uh uh)
Now the story's fabricated, the public is elated
That somebody from the west considered the next greatest (Who's next)
The Prince (haha), and don't get it twisted (Uh huh)
I spit from the soul but the steez is just gifted
I lived it, talked about him (yeah), ridin' now, we'll walk about it (yeah)
Death of Cornballs like chalk, put the line around it (Haha)
On some D.O.A. shit
No gangsta reality's as real as it gets (Fo' real)
I remember writin' rhymes in the halfway house (Uh huh)
Now I'm sittin' at the top, there's somethin' to talk about

I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)

Uh!
These words go together like a verbal collage
It's murder how the words'll collide
And bring you further from where murderers lie
And maybe you could see a mill, no not no burgers or fries
But give you food for thought, my nigga this is Gerber with rhymes
Servin' up lines for your child like mine, nigga this live
So you think you seen a style like mine, it's a mirage
But I, I'll be obliged like Mary J
Then show you how to strive, when it die like everyday
And nigga stay in court like Perry Mason or Gary Payton
New shoes up on his feet like every week, his mom's interogatin'
Like where you been? Who you been with?
Scared he runnin the streets with them freak and them nitwits
Look up in his face, she see the fatherly resemblence
Read him more than a book
Scared he inherited way more than just looks
But uh, mama I'm on top of the world
Uh! I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world!



[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh-huh

[Verse]

Headed south, dog, my mom ain't seen her son in awhile
Yea, I'll sure is

Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit
Yea, so nigga watch it!
A nigga been in NY tryna get some bigger pockets
You still up in the ville, tryna make it in the trap
I'm finna put us on the map; I told you I was coming back, Cuz
Yeah, so make way, the prince of the city, ain't a street I can't stay
You niggas is hatin,' just be happy I ain't changed
Blunts rolled to the murk, we all want the same thing
And that's- money to feed us, yup
We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet Him yet, haha!
Yea, If I never..
Nigga, man
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga
Cause, uh
Na na na
Now I'mma always come home

Where a nigga was shown
How to scrap, yup
Shown how to mack, yup
Where my niggas sold a whole lot of crack, yup
Juggling them hoes

Momma work to the bone
Putting clothes on my back

Yea, I swear they say, man
Yea, yeah

Yeah, I just touched down man

Oh the Live? I'm in there, nigga



[Intro]
Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse: 1]
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Peedi started
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures (ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04
No disrespect to my favorite player
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich
So I'm slaying niggas, yea

[Hook]
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it

[Verse: 2]
Niggas in the streets, no
Niggas blessed beats
I got that priest flow, heavenly
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock
Just a figure a speech for the Glock
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot (yea)
Like our beats yo, it's hot
Niggas laid out
Caught a fake nigga centerfield it's cause they played out
Watch our boys fade out, niggas tryna hate
If he only knew my dick's in his dame's mouth
Just made out, came out the woodworks
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork
I'm getting real green, y'all niggas playing on some good turf
Fake money, scared money, never make money
And a nigga never fear nothing but God
Fuck a facade
I'm just focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit
Nigga I
Yea

[Hook]

[Verse: 3]
Tell 'em Geppettos my niggas in ghettos with Scarface dreams
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screams
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Sling dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yea it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break
They never wanted us to make it, yea
To my niggas smart enough to be smart enough to take it, nigga!



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Below that Mason Dixon my residence

I'll leave you leakin you lay in pieces
As if the streets a couch and shit
You see me on my bouncin shit
Watch how I put you out this shit
Man I'm makin so much money gotta pay somebody to count this shit
Probably gonna make my accountant sick
Boy I'm higher than a mountain's get

And I can understand why niggas sayin Dom is next

Wait till a nigga blow up, watch who you peep me with
I only want her for tonight man you can keep this bitch
Peep this shit I got my 20's

A new night, a new city

To the kids of America and all these fucking slums
If you want to be King then I suggest you vote for Bun
A real nigga know, when a real nigga's done
If you want to be a King then I suggest you vote for Bun
Like that



No album to my name and I’m already hot
You could say I’m preheated
If money talks, mine telling yours to be seated
Cut my leg off, I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game, bitch
And you can retweet it
E-mail the shit, make sure you Cc it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I be in the airport, damn near barefoot
Security hollering out “Cole, we need it!”
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinking, I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain’t no fucking G, boy
Your style G-rated
Hatred is flattery, glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late, now it’s happy belated

Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix breed, fame, and pain, this it's heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just painting my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told, I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Images, everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, then what they believe
Money short, so this jewelry is like a weave
Here to deceive and hear niggas say, "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
The police wanna stop you, frisk you, wonder, "What he do?"
If a hater snatch a chain I bet it still won't free you
Cause I'll be right back grindin' 'til I cop another
I sit and think 'bout all the shit I could've copped my mother
My partner say, "That's just the game, my nigga"
So I hear my jeweler say, "Here goes your chain, my nigga"



[Verse 1]
Whoever thought a Carolina nigga would've been the greatest
We strong cause the hard times made us into men
Hold up I gotta say that shit again
I said the hard times made us into men
See a man gonna stand with the world as a weight
But the boy gonna break, only so much he could take
See I traveled outta state and I ain't know a soul
Told my momma I'd be back when I had a million sold
Million flows million stories I done told
Shed tears when they cut me from the team couldn't wait till next year
Then I told the best player look
"Though I ain't as tall as y'all niggas
Next year I'mma be better then all ya'll niggas"
Ay this is for the Ville shout to all ya'll niggas
I pray you never pass like them ballhog niggas
And at all cost nigga I'mma shine
They gon' remember my name like it's tatted on they mind
J. Cole J. Cole
Ay, fresher than a day old newborn, bitches blowing kisses
That's the same ho that you on
I knew her back in high-school, but heard she failed college
She blew me like she blew her nail polish
That's knowledge if I ever seen it
Say I'mma call her, but don't ever mean it
See I'm preoccupied, watch how my stock arise
She want the time and that's just something I cannot provide
Cause time is money and I, I ain't no dummy and I
I'm trying get paid, man I gotta stay brave Atlanta
I let your misses sip me, I ain't talking David Banner, ain't a planner
So if it's random then it's naturally
Name a motherfucker out here matching me

[Outro]
Nigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good
Nigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good
Nigga I'm feeling good



[Verse]
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind
A savage over this cabbage
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (no)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs
I'm on my grind, yo
Bonafide hancho
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds
Matter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick
Survival's a bitch
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0
God knows I don't put up no facade, no
No fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob
Keep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh
From the other side, punk-ass nigga
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk
Blast pop while I pump gas
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath
My niggas will ride all day like a fun pass
That's some New York shit
I'm from the south, though
Don't never disrespect me out yo mouth ho
I got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro

J. Cole
[Verse 1]
Got a young chick from the hood, south side
Pops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit she was up against
Little did he know the shit was going to back fire
‘Cause she act quiet, got baptized, sang in the choir
But the thing she desired was a
Older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girl is in heat, it’s deep
She sneaking out, off the leash
On the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out, he kicked her out
She living on her own and it’s vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room
And I’m thinking of the best way to kick her out

[Hook]
‘Cause all she ever talks about is Louie, Louie
All she ever talks about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can’t fuck with her no more
I mean Louie, Louie, all she ever talk about is Louie, Louie
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can’t fuck with her no more

[Verse 2]
I told the bitch somebody stole my Rollie
She talking ‘bout “me too”
I came through with the brand new Louis bag
She talking ‘bout “me too”
LA on my next flight, you guess right, she said “me too”
Now everybody gonna Ms. Me Too
Goddamn, be you
And if that is you, you so shallow
You on a boat that won’t travel
Won’t float and won’t paddle
If I go broke it won’t matter
This stupid ass shit don’t make me
I been poor, won’t break me
You so caught up on material shit
We both know that you can’t even get

[Hook]
I mean my window down
Let me roll my windows up
My plink went down
I just got my little cup
My freaks go down
Nigga I can’t fuck with her no more
Ayo, ayo…

[Verse 3]
Dude got a rich bitch, though
She off the chain, ready to go
Baddest thing, head to toe
Fine line between a rock star and just a ho
But she walked that
Goddamn, girl, she walked that
Big money talk real loud
I mean I can barely talk back
But I, but I got good game, good game
Nothing like them lames you used to
I know the rules gon’ use you
I just want the same shit that you do
Can you keep a secret?
Sometimes, man, your beeper leak it
Nigga told me she evil
I danced with the devil then, please believe it
Please believe it

[Hook]
She take my hip-hop, ayo
She don’t want to fuck with me
Am I big snob? Ayo
She might not fuck with me
Am I a big splotch? Ayo
She don’t want to fuck with me no more



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Let me tell you a little story about my homie Corey
Right now he's locked down serving at least forty
But excuse me, I got ahead of myself, I'm sorry son
This story starts in his youth, he was hardly one
When his pops got knocked for coping rocks
From under cover cops on the corner of his block
And he never got a chance to meet him
Cause the very next year his pops is laying still in the prison cell bleeding from stab wounds, fatal
Bad news Corey's mother and older brother already caught in the struggle
Brother barely ate tryna hustle just to carry weight
The whole family underweight cause they rarely ate
One thing my nigga never got was love
And his whole childhood he was watching drug addicts
His brother supplying it, old mother buying it
You expect a scientist to come from this environment
Get real!, this shits hard enough brought up black
But being poor plus your mums on crack
And your brothers a hustler tryna take you under his wing shit, just a fucking wonder his breathing

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Age five, Corey had dreams to be a cop, but
Age six, his older brother passed the Glock, let him hold it
Plans change, he started his campaign
Age thirteen, little boy doing big man things
And that's what he thought
He was jacking rims from mustangs
Beating down on his class mates for chump change
Running round with the tough gang
The older niggas he sold dope for 'em, they bought clothes for him
However, soon he got older and selling petty dimes turned into some pretty heavy crimes
The shit got to the point where he was stealing rides from his block
Even robbing quick stops
Ladies loved him, he was crazy fucking
Knocking boos daily, pretty soon he had a baby coming
But he didn't claim it, his baby mother was crazy loving him
She said "Baby, let's settle down," he left her hanging
He'd rather be on the streets slanging a wild cat
But god damn i seen it coming a mile back
A drug deal gone bad guns bursting
Now Corey lying in a cell cause he merked him
Whats the moral of the story?, figure it out
So the next time you ask why niggas are wild
You know with out a doubt, don't try and deny the shit
Young black male, a product of his environment

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cause i can't stand to see my people struggling
But what we up against? tough conditions in this life
And they wonder why these niggas all get hype, get high and fist fight
Or why they live like they living, to get ice and cars
No type of jobs, income coming from dicing and robbing niggas in broad daylight
Its hard cause all they know in this life is scars
This mic is all i need to change the globe, re-arrange it and make it so
Niggas ain't in pain no more
Cause they they don't pay no more mind to all youth
Till they got to locking them up and dawg that's the truth yo
Thats the truth yo, that's the truth



BET.com: You got some backlash for anti-gay lyrics and you gave a statement to the Huffington Post. Do you regret using the word “f*****”?

J. Cole: No, not at all. It’s much different than the autism thing, it wasn’t conscious; that was a slip-up, being offensive without intent. The line was to engage the conversation of homophobia in Black culture and in hip hop. I thought it was going to be a way more interesting conversation that came from it. Of course I made the statement, but I thought from that it would spawn better conversations like, “Why are we so homophobic?” Much more than I think any other culture, I don’t want to just compare it to white people, but in terms of jokes that you make — everything’s got to be “pause” or “no homo.” You can't even play basketball without someone saying, “pause.” I’m not innocent of it. I am part of that same culture – but why? That line was supposed to be offensive and confusing, but I was hoping to have more conversations about it.

BET.com: There’s been a lot of conversation about the Trayvon Martin tragedy and what young Black men experience. Do you experience racism?

J. Cole: For sure, absolutely, I just got pulled over on 42nd street in Times Square for what I believe was nothing. They said it was for tints on my front window, which is barely tinted. I really believe it was because I had my hat low. I was driving through Times Square and I just didn’t want to be seen. So I had my hat low and I think I was looking “suspicious” just as a Black man with my brim low, when I was really just trying to cover my face. They came to my window, pulled me over. I feel like if I was a white man driving, they wouldn’t question me about my tints. They told me to roll down my back window; they look in my car as if they’re looking for something. I feel like that was the real thing, they were trying to catch somebody slipping. That just happened three days ago. I almost didn’t even name that because I am so used to that. That’s something that I feel like somebody my age that’s white doesn’t have to go through, especially in New York City. On the other hand, every time I’m on the plane in first class — this is a lesser evil but it still represents their mind state — I promise you, 60 percent of the time somebody asks me what basketball team do I play for or do I rap. [Laughs] I am a rapper, I wish I could tell them something better — that happens all the time and I hate it. I hate that we’re stereotyped and I hate that I’m fitting into the same stereotype.

BET.com: You’ve talked about including dark-skinned women in your music videos versus all light-skinned women. The light-skinned, dark-skinned issue certainly affects women in hip hop; does it affect men in hip hop?

J. Cole: I can’t say it for sure but I just think we’re still in America. We’re still Black Americans. Those mental chains are still in us. That brainwashing that tells us that light skin is better, it’s subconsciously in us, whether we know it or not… still pursuing light skin women. There are some women out there that are like, “I don’t even like light skin men” and that’s fine. But Barack Obama would not be President if he were dark skin. You know what I mean? That’s just the truth. I might not be as successful as I am now if I was dark skin. I’m not saying that for sure, I’m still as talented as I am and Obama is still as smart as he is, but it’s just a sad truth… I don’t even know if this is going to translate well into text and people not hearing what I’m saying, but it’s a sad reality. So I can only naturally assume it’s probably easier for a light skin male rapper than it might be for a dark skin male rapper. It’s all subconscious s***, nobody’s aware — I think that s*** still subconsciously affects us.



[Verse 1]
Allow me to set the scene first
This little nigga no older than seventeen in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walkin' down the mean murk, where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt’ll find a nigga
Even if you tryna' get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smirk, he smiled back
He remembered this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialed back
How niggas do, he kept it movin', couldn’t wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn’t wait to get shown
Straight A’s as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he’d get her out for good
That made him smile
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn’t wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn’t wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon' save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he’s fading out, the favorite child
He’s fading out (the favorite child)



[Verse 1: Nervous Reck]
Big Nerve out of the bullpen with the assist

[Hook]
You got your feelings hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing and I don't care how you feel about it
You got your feelings hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing and I don't care how you feel about it

[Verse 2: Nervous Reck]
Look at the product it's nice
Fuck with fire and ice
Cheated on my girlfriend until my tires got sliced
Just got some x pills we gonna try em tonight
Hang on tight girl you going for the ride of yo life
Everything was fine until she said I wasn't her type
Oh I get it all the time its because that I'm white
She was like "nah I'm used to dudes packin' the pipe
So you can just drop me off if you ain't tappin' me right"
I hysterically laughed girl I ain't scared of yo ass
I don ate more pies than even sara lee has
So when I get done with that you wanna marry me ha
Play in the backyard so I can bury the cash
And I can bury the bone cuz I am heir to the throne
I don't need no help see I can carry my own
No time for tricks bitch curly larry or moe
I hit with a big stick it's only fair that you know

[Hook]
You got your feelings hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing and I don't care how you feel about it
You got your feelings hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing and I don't care how you feel about it

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the story of a young man who left everyone and everything he loved to chase his dream. A lil' nigga from North Carolina, Fayetnam to be exact. Packed up all his shit and moved to the big city of dreams, where he ain't know a mother fuckin' soul, and he ain't have a mother fuckin' thing, just a dollar and a dream.

This mixtape is provided partly in part by, Dreamville Records Straight out the Ville where anything is possible All-terain music, that's Carolina's finest boy and by any means, when ain't shit handed to you, you gotta take it. Without further ado ladies and gentlemen I proudly present to you, J. Cole, The Come Up.



[Intro]
Yeah
It's therapist
The golden child
Yeah
Peep what I'm saying
Yo, yo, check it, yo

[Verse 1]
Yeah you cats is fly but your plane is crashing
You came and passed
My range blasting
I came slashing
Same fashion
That OJ stabbed him
My brain's packed with more lines than caine addicts
These insane raps should stay wrapped in a Straitjacket
You featherweight class bitch
Don't want mine
That's why your whole squad is telling me
"Pick on someone your own size"
I got the whole nine
Ain't perfect but I'm border lining
My album come with a surgeon general's warning on it (Sick)
I spit a born vomit
The hot shit
Even when I die shit
I'll still be the livest
Quit with the nonsense
You hating but you feeling it though
Stepped on stage
Got arrested for stealing the show
Stealing the zone
Never left it
Niggas never contested
On a five star scale you get one less then Texas (Get it)
I got narcoleptics
Why the whote now
When this shit goes down
Niggas barely show up when I show down
I hold ground
Go more rounds than carrousels
And you beating me only happens in fairy tales
You dreaming
My pieces is so dope you feinding
That Cole flow you sink
When I dive off the deep end
I'm head hunting
Heads front
But ain't said nothing
So heads up or spill red blood cause your head is gushing
Bitch what
No STD's
But still a sick fuck
You blast from point blank range and never hit once
I'm heaven sent
From devilish
To Specialist
You niggas couldn't make a good impression of what cements
So throw up the white flag
No need to fight back
Drop your mic
Head to the freezer
And grab the knife pack
Get your lights snatched
I'm cold as the ice cap
Sold my soul to satan
Turned around and stole it right back
I'm jacking dead broke folks cause I'm dirt poorer
I tried to ball but fouled out in the first quarter
Flagrant rhymes
The facts that you proclaiming
They aiming the same phrase as mine
Taking the same frame of mind
I'm out to shine on any track that I'm hopping on
Changing album names
The false alarm
It's not the bomb
The style is off the wall
Kick shit like Bandhan
Therapist is the man
Hands down like a handstand
With a grand flow and my heart had to follow
I'm so ahead of my time I wrote this rhyme tomorrow, what



J. Cole - The Warm Up



[Snippet]
(Let me live, let me live, let me live)
Peak in my life, check if you like just what you see
Though you might disagree with my plight
This shit that I write is just like therapeutic for me
There's no shooters for me
Just some niggas that wanna prove to me they down
I rarely bring 'em 'round, cause they still stuck in their ways
Mindstate still the same
Can't help nobody till they ready to change
But I don't give up, I'll be here waiting for you the day you decide that you'll no longer be a slave to your pride
Until then, keep your head on a swivel
For my niggas that dibble, dabble in street life
Hopin' to get a nibble of American pie, equality
An arrogant lie
Told louder by the people that hold power
Listen, this is a setup
I know you feel the rush that niggas get when dollars switch hands
And you can say you got your bread up
But don't be short sighted
See, it's a war that's goin' on outside
Nigga, you got to know about this shit to fight it
I wanna help you through
I'm on the road to sanity with all humanity behind us
Hope they comin' too
These words I spoke are nothin' new
There's nothin' that I [...]
There's nothin' that you cannot do
The truth is right aside of you
Through troubled waters just canoe
Have faith for something greater than to guide you through
These words are for all, me and you



[Verse]
Crack music, nigga...get smacked music, nigga!
Look, you see them ruby red diamonds on my ice
You can call it what you want shit'll prolly change ya life
If you stole it and you pawned it
You should prolly think twice, well connected so I'm on it
Well connected on yo flight, you niggas be writing sonnets writing sonnets
Like we miss you we miss you
Mama go get the tissue
Them things start blastin, Mark Jackson can't assist you
Life cut short like initials, raps or the pistols
One way or another, I'mma uplift you BLAOW!!
You believe me, then you crazy
All these little niggas out here wanna be me but they lazy
Step ya game up get ya name up
Look how I came up
Remember this bitch in high school I liked said I was lame but
I played it off Deep down I was ashamed
But walking through these hallways, all you got is your name
The boy she liked was g-like and very slang
Whips and fresh clothes and so they doing they thang
I ain't good enough
I ain't hood enough
This older nigga stepped up to me at my locker I said put em up ready to jab at
Much to my surprise that nigga backed back
And went about his way
I threw my notebook in my backpack
Walked home just to get my thoughts goin
It’s a hardcore world if they think you soft porn
Niggas will try to fuck you
And steal, rob, or cut you
And we ain't sellin dope but we still gotta hustle
And this that crack music, nigga thatget smacked music, nigga!



[Intro: J Cole.]
Yeah yeah yeah. Therapist, uh yeah, check it yo. What's the reasons? Yeah, hey, yo listen. Not yet, yeah yeah. Fayettnam forever, listen yo yo yo hey

[Verse 1: J Cole}
I lean back like the incense and relax
Well try to relax, but gotta be ready to react
To anything, many things, anyone
When it comes to drama i done seen plenty dawg ain't even 21
Remember counting pennies up as a bright kid
Now I'm dreaming to put my mother up in a nice crib
But we all on this wild goose chase for big checks
You hate and disrespect, and I ain't even rich yet
Imagine when I'll be there, beware
For these nigga's that so broke, that there's no hope for repair
And prepare for these stares, iced grills don't ever be scared
They breathe air just like you, gotta see clear cause
Money will blind you shit in front of your eyes
You will see it all, until you ain't breathing dawg
Cause then it's too late, i must say, im trying to stay on earth
I pray to god, he told me "Yo you gotta stay alert to stay alive"

[Outro:Bobwire]
Yo you best believe we out here grinding motherfuckers
This ain't no joke, save the party and bullshit for later
Right now we trying to make this paper
Chicago PA, DT, BA, Maryland and DC
Niggas out here trying to hussle and all terrains gonna eat



[Verse 1]
I'm try watch my mouth, I already know what it is
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I thinked about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material things I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villians?
Knowing they killin’
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Verse 2]
C.R.E.A.M get the money, dollar dollar billion
Cash rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
Everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money dollar dollar
Look hey
I'mma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I pay dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though I'm never going back
I said I'm never going back No!

[Verse 3]
Look kid, its raining outside boy
F--- an umbrella, man they banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And f--- policing, they killing brothers what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, boy I’ve been real
Westwood I said I've been real



Cold blooded nigga, hoes love a nigga
She said she only fuck me and no other nigga
Don’t believe her but it’s nice to hear
Never ever thought life was fair
But I’m quite prepared
The boy nice cause he writes sincere
Draw straight from the heart send it right to ears
Think smart, play your part like Tyson here
Nigga I cheated death twice this year
I got the right to wear ice and swear like I never went to college
Or get direct deposits that could never fit in wallets
Clever but I’m ghetto tho I never lived in projects
On a level with the pilots, fuck the devil
This the hottest shit you’ll ever get to ride with
Though you’ll never get beside it
Got it, flow psychotic
Fruits of my labour, ya’ll hoped I rotted
Backpack and mainstream, both how I got it
Nas and Hov at the same damn time
Pac and BIG in the same damn mind
You can have a lot of whips and you can have a lot of chips
And you can have a lot of bitches but you can’t have mine



Straight out the dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don’t make it back
Hey, hey, ugh
Gossip from those that barely knew my name
I guess they figured I changed with this new found fame
Or this new damn chain
I’m in a new damn lane
Now my money taller than Shaq stacked with two Yao Mings
But never mind them haters girl
I won’t bring you round lames
Rather bring you round Hov
Let you meet Bron James
Sit you up in VIP and let you sip Champagne
Watch them jealous hoes peeking
Mad they just can’t hang
If that's the ish you into
This life is funny cause despite the money
Nothing stops the rain from pouring
Life ain't always bright and sunny
Nothing stops the pain, you just ignore it
And keep fighting honey
So much drive, ain't no cop alive can take my license from me
I’m swerving on em, fast lane
Fayettenam lifestyle, foot down on the gas man
Passport tight now, I’m leaving on the last plane
Balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name
I said balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name

J. Cole - Cole World: The Sideline Story




[Verse 1]
Drama is a must
Kinda like a condom when I buss
I'm rotten but I'm polished
I'm a diamond in the rough
From North Cacs
Never could I come off whack
Some of y'all cats is pussys I ain't hung off that
Call your squad get every nigga off the block
Call the cops the SWAT team
All to stop me
I cock these
Y'all niggas is frost cuz you talk a lot
But never strap like a halter top
Y'all are not gangters for God's sake cool it
'For you snooze and pick the wrong nigga to fool with
An you get introduced to two fists, Timbaland boots are mint
And beat to death with a pool stick
I'm through with jokes
I'm through with stupid folks that say they get hanged
Whats the use its hopeless
You fools is smokin
Me loosing focus
It's like a mother fucker drinking juice and chocking
My mood is upset
Your crew is suspect
My unit is some niggas I dare you to fuck with
Plus, I'm the illest as soon as I feel it hittin
You can't fight the feeling revealing mi killah instinct

[Hook]
I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
You willing to die, No
That's why we all gotta live a killer inside yo
Whether it's a tool or I use a knife
If the mood is right concludes your life
I'm bruisin
N I'll take it to any nigga to doubt that
This killa be killed and I ain't even out yet

[Verse 2]
The bigger they come the harder they drop
I give it all that I got
My money couldn't find another artist to rock
Harder I'm cock
Diesel i'm nice
Move like a theif in the night
Sickest Mo'fucker to ever breath on the mic
Is here in the flesh
Sincere when I swear I'm the best
Niggas ain't tryna hear it unless you do it correct
Never losing a step
Never losing respect
You act stupid and step I'll introduce you to death
I'm losing my head
A few screw lose in my neck
I'm not stable
I came real y'all drop fakers
You not able to hang one around your finish
I never draw the line unless you're surrounded in it
Watered down niggas drownin in it
But surrounded by angus
Niggas hold me down and menace
Crash you this major don't take offence please
Blaming your face is a basic instinct

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You [?]some shit fucked
Cuz every word I utter is intent you faggot
Fukin with this is like punching cement
I know your type you bluffin with tough talk
You scared to brawl
Never steppin but your mind is running marathons
It's hopeless, I'm focussed, I won't miss
Any fool wanna oppose get your throat slit
You can't call it I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learn from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit
Throw fists even if your voice is deep
Niggas suffer from arthritis their joints is weak
North Cacs where the mo'fuckin turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo Funny how tables turn in life
Pay your dues earn your stripes
Never be concerned with ice
Cuz check it out
The more money you pay for it
It's just giving even me more reasons to take this shit
The main event, serving niggas
The way y'all run through these herds with these words is disturbing niggas
So leave it alone
I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
Don't need to play games, I'm in a league of my own
It's Therapist niggas
Dismiss you dick kisses
For you to get bigger your shit is slimmer than stick figures
Faggots can't stand how much love I get
But if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm takin over
I got what it takes to make it over the top
You tryna test me then stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feelin the most
Stepped off stage got arrested for stealing the show
Mother fucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah cuz I ain't going out yet, Mo'fucka
It's Therapist I got the killah instinct
Nervous Reck he got the killah instict
F[?] Rich he got the killah instinct
The whole fucking Crash room they got the killah instinct
My man All Mighty he got the killah instinct
My man Dialect he got the killah instinct
The nigga Volatile he got the killah instinct
Omen and Elite them niggas got the killah instinct
It's killah instinct



[Verse 1: Therapist]

Yo you up on some shit fuck
Cuz every word I utter's intent you faggot
Fucking with this is like punching cement
I know your type, you bluffing with tough talk you scared to brawl
Never stepping but your mouth is running marathons
Its hopeless, I'm focused, I won't miss
Any foes want to oppose get your throats slit
You can't call it, I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learnt from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit (get it? Damn)
Know this even if your voice is deep
Niggas sufferin' from arthritis they joints is weak
Know if cats know where the motherfuckin' turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo funny how tables turn and life pays your dues
Earn your stripes, never be concerned with ice cuz check it out
The more money you pay for rent, is just givin' me even more reason to take this shit
The main event, servin' niggas the way y'all run through these herds with these words is distrubin' niggas
So leave it alone, I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
No need to play games I'm in a league of my own
Its therapist niggas, dismiss you dick kissers, for you to get bigger than shits slimmer than stick figures
You faggots can't stand how much love I get, but if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm taking over, I got what it takes to make it over the top you trynna diss me to stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feeling the most stepped on stage got arrested for stealing the show mothafucka

Yo my brain in the forecast, Therapist broadcast Philly to North tax(?) you really don't want that
Therapist and meddafore niggas remeber the name remember tha Game niggas



[Hook]
La la la la laaah
They ain't got nothing on me
Hey hey
La la la la la la la
They ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 1]
The lil engine that could
This lil nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good
Cause homie I’ve been ill
Since Hilfiger was hood (ha-ha remember that? Hilfiger cargoes’)
Won't admit it but if you was a real nigga you would
And now I got your chick nigga
She'll get out the hood
And no I would peck her but she peck on my wood
And she do it so good
I gotta thank her
I got her ass clapping that’s how I congratulate her
She like to roll the dro up in the bed go higher
Pepsi cola Michael Jackson and her head so fire
I love this lil redbone Maya
She be getting louder than a set of Dr Dre head phones try her
If you ever need her
She got a man that don't never see her
And when his phone ring he looking like "this better be her"
This unrelated but I wish I could have met Aaliyah
And when I get to heaven, homie I better see her
But what you think it's really like behind the pearly gates
No murder rates all the bad shit we heard of race
And can we still do the fun shit we did love and if so
Then do you think some angels work in strip clubs
Well if so I be trying to get my dick rubbed
Make it rain filling up their tip cups
Throwing ones...

[Bridge]
Yeah nigga I'm the one
(Hey hey)
Say I’m the one
Yeah boy I'm the one
Hey yeah
Now I'm the one thus meaning no one must try
No two no three no four, no why?
Cause I'm the one
Yeah nigga I'm the one

[Verse 2]
Now every nigga keep talking keep walking
This the Ville where the real killers don’t speak often
But leave you leaking on the concrete police talking
My flow Nieman Marcus
You're so flea market so don't be starting cause Cole retarded
I be shitting on my niggas and my dough be farting
They won’t even say excuse me
Usually the groupies don't amuse me
Just wanna say I rate the tape my paper my loosely(?)
But can I take a lil dip in your Jacuzzi
Now I ain't Biggie but I got you feeling +Juicy+
Ohh she feeling like she never before
I bet she never forget me like an elephant won't
And yeah my name J.Cole I got a hell of a flow
I guarantee I'm gon sell em if you ever been poor
Or if you're trying to be rich
And this economy shhh if anything making money man
It’s probably this
Boy I'm the one...

[Bridge]
[Hook]

[Third Verse]
The lil engine that could
This lil nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good
A couple of yall ain't took a field trip to the hood
Ay me I'm Fresh Prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood Baby!
Ain't sayin names but we not the same
All that money and the fame don’t change the fact that u lame
Might wanna grab you a chain wanna tip up your hat
Might wanna purchase some game homie your shit is so wack!!!
I got my finger on the trigger tell that nigga hold datt
Boy I’m picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I’m young black get to live my life on the run!
Bet ya bottom dollar before I’m done
They say that I’m the one
Yeah nigga I’m the one HA!!

[Bridge]



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Dear Mrs Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job, don't mean to disrespect ya
But we been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby
(Yeah, if you only knew) I got bigger problems baby
Hey
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothing to me
'Cause right now I got my little boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me, listen here
I ain't looking for no tears but my brother got a year
And my mother keep smoking that shit
On top of that I'm broke, please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then I holla

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me
I need to be left
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Mr Policeman
Ayy, am I wrong or ain't you supposed to keep the peace man
I could have swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh no I get it I get it I get it
Or 'cause I'm black? Hmm maybe
Yeah hey tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound
Man i'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frowned on me
With your flashlight tell me what do you see
Thug niggas drug dealers it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mother fucking college degree

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'ma fuckin try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, man, we don't make the news
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods "be fuckin all these white hoes"
Anchorman stop snitchin
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?
Are you perfect motherfucker, how you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone



They say anythings possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can hoe
They try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas ass no bikini man

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, yo, niggas don't want drama (nah)
See they talk proper, but when it comes time to spark
They all tryna catch alzheimers
You all talking no wack shit
You outta get smacked faggot
I seen harder niggas in drag
I'm bigger than that
So test me, don't even ask about it
Do the math and count it
You ain't got half the talent
Niggas laugh and doubt it
But only 'till my cash is sprouted
Put up your best track, I'll run laps around it
Yo, I'm coming for death, you running for life
Fuck a gun or a knife
My numbers is right
Enough of this hype
Let's get to it
Nigga you sick, prove it
Your style's transparent
Mr. Magoo could look through it
And it's true I'm not a thug, but I handle mines
And grammar wise you analyze, I vandalize
Which man standing trying to get branded with death
Falling off stage with a mic stand on your chest
Yo, take a number
Cause all these niggas thinking they can rumble with the rapist
Suffer from some sort of brain disorder
The rain is pouring now
Nigga check the brain storm
Won't stop until my name is embroidered on the gravestone

[Hook: ?]
The therapist boy you like collab
A pair of fist lefty
Mr. do right have's
And there's your [?]
Embarrassment, how bad too delicate for carelessness
You out your element
Syrhenz (×4)
You out your element
Syrhenz (×4)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Loose cannon, when I shoot amateurs
Truth [?]
Ain't a crew standing can do damage
This shit is rock solid
Niggas bark harder than rottweilers
I rock polish, I spit top notch
You rock bottom
Assed out, my raps similar to a crack house
So dope these niggas take two puffs then pass out
Relax now, never back down
When the bells rung, cause I serve beef raw but well done
You can tell hell where I hail from
The reigning champ, main event rhyming
Y'all still in training camp
Fucking with me so you gotta be nice
But you got better odds trying to hit the lottery twice
Nucka, stop the nonsense or get knocked unconscious
The rhymes I'm designing is monstrous
My arsenal bomb shit
Got the haters loving it now
Watch my shit hit the ceiling
'Till it's covered in brown

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
The therapist leading the pack
Type of cat to ball
You call without asking, no bringing it back
I'm made checking
Place your wages and bets
The stakes is raising
If you ain't gotcha money on me, you brain's defecting
Pains ejecting, whenever my name is mentioned
The games is lynching, hang and hitch me
This natural instinct
More than half you faggots against me
Now watch as I turn this beat to minced meat
Case closed, snap souls along with pesos
My entire camp play cold, below the waist blows
Never take no for responses, I'm word boxing
You [?] watch as I flip and take the world hostage

[Bridge: J. Cole]
The therapist niggas
Yo, you out your element
What the fuck niggas thinking 'bout
Yo, check it, yo
You out your element
Yeah niggas, yo you out your element
What the fuck ya'll niggas thinking 'bout

[Hook]

Artwork:





1. J.Cole first off I loved Born Sinner! My question is why did you create the website stream for the album before it even came out?

Cole - so fans didn't feel so bad for listening early
2. What did your homie who was disappointed your first Dead Presidents freestyle think of the second one?

Cole - he was silenced forever. wasn't my homie, knew him through somebody else. but he's on Mute now
3. If there was one thing you could've done differently music-wise, what would it have been?

Cole - sell Friday night lights
4. What is one musician you love that most people would not expect you to listen to?

Cole - Eric Clapton
5. Hearing that you're a big Outkast fan i'll ask you this; ATLiens or Aquemini?

Cole - DAMN. That's tough. But Aquemini
6. Can you speak on your favorite track on Born Sinner?
Can you speak on your production process you took on Born Sinner?

Cole - First answer! Favorite song is too hard to decide. But I will say Runaway is definitely in the running. The verses!
Production process is an easier question to answer for me. I just let it FLOW. Normally I start out by finding drum sounds and patterns that make me move. for instance, Runaway started by flipping a real dirty drum loop, then adding a harder kick on top. Once i get drums that Move me and excite me, I look to add music (samples or something i'm playing) that make the marriage complete
Born sinner plays with a lot of Double time tempo's. Shit like power trip, that moves your head as if it's fast paced. but in reality, its technically a SLOW beat. The breakdown on LAnd of the Snakes another example. Or rich niggas
Thanks for the question
7. What internet sites do you frequent, non-music related?

Cole - can i be honest? without getting killed off by Reddit community. I go to Digg a lot. I know Reddit ethered Digg a while ago, because of the amazing COMMUNITY experience of reddit. But I still rock with them
Don't taze me bro
8. Why wasn't the beat that was used in the first Born Sinner uStream used on the album?

Cole - Didn't like the verses on it! they were hard but sometimes a beat is so good it's overpowering and intimidating. that beat is like that
9. What did you have for lunch today?
Also, what's your favourite music video?
Yo i got another one, what's your favourite kind of booze?

Cole - haven't eaten yet today. you just reminded me that i need to eat
10. Have you received any feedback (positive/negative) about your “Faggot” bars on Villuminati?

Cole - yes. i'm a communications major, studied PR. I knew what I was getting into. The comment I gave to Huffington Post was genuine and the reason why I wrote those bars. The line even makes me uncomfortable, but it's worth it for the sake of the conversation
11.  What was the most meaningful song on Born Sinner?
To me it felt like you poured your heart out and went all in on this album. Love the work. Keep it coming, you're for real, man. Changing the game..

Cole - There is a lot of MEANING on the album. so most meaningful is hard. But I really love the title track "Born Sinner." Because even though there's lots of pitfalls, temptations, dangers, and tribulations on the album, it ends in a hopeful place with "i'm a born sinner, but i'll die BETTER than that" listen to those verses for more clarity. plus i touch on the things that are really important to me. relationship (got her life in my grip), family (she hate the way she raised me but she loved what she raised), friends (if i died today my nigga was it business, was it personal?)
Thank you
12. Kid Cudi self-produced the whole album, Indicud, like you did on Born Sinner. What is you personal opinion on INDICUD?

Cole - I haven't heard INDICUD because I was working on my album. But I'm really mad at myself for not finishing a verse for that album in time. Got in the studio with Cudi and he was cool as shit. Good dude. I never did my verse and the joint was harddd
13. One thing that I think everyone here wants to ask: Can you tell us anything new about your upcoming album with Kendrick Lamar? I really love Born Sinner by the way, can't wait to see where you go next, but I want to emphasize how good what you're doing right now is. And thanks for doing this AMA!

Cole - Thank you. This question will be asked a lot so I'll just answer it here. We have some really good songs in the stash, but haven't had a chance to properly work on a project. An album will come in the future, but probably not this year. I'm just happy for my niggaaa
14. How did it feel when you heard Nas on Let Nas Down Remix?

Cole - Surreal. Today is my first day off in a LONG TIME (other than this. but this isn't WORK) I plan on soaking in that moment tonight and really reflecting on how amazing that is
15. What made you want to work with James Fauntleroy? He is incredible

Cole - This is weird. You asked me a question. And then answered your own question
16. did you have a fan base before you you got signed?

Cole - yes. i called them friends
That was it really. few hundred people had heard The Come Up, and School Daze was popping on my myspace page. No buzz though. Just skeelz
17. Favorite nba team?

Cole - no real team loyalty. just follow players now. Looking for a home. my last favorite team was the KNICKS because Penny Hardaway's last real playing years were there (and i just happened to be in NYC for college). Before that it was the Magic, then the Suns. NEVER FAVORITE A TEAM BECAUSE OF A PLAYER, when he leaves you're gonna be lost in the world
18. So....have you met Jay Electronica? How's he like?
Who's your favorite celebrity that you've met/would like to meet?

Cole - jay electronica has the most phone numbers out of anybody i ever met. He changes his number every 16 hours
19. How did you celebrate the release of born sinner?
Cole world

Cole - got twisted tuesday night with friends and fam in NYC while feeling really grateful and relieved and blessed and happy
20. COLE I HOOKED YOU UP WITH THAT GIANT BORN SINNER PIC BY YOUR NAME, PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE YA BOY'S EXISTENCE

Cole - acknowledged
21. Congratulations on Nas's remix to your joint Cole!
Listening to your songs I often get chills. Songs such as God's Gift, Return of Simba, See it to Believe it and too many songs off of Born Sinner! Has there ever been a song you've heard whether it be from Nas or someone else that has blown your mind and influenced your style greatly?

Cole - Nas- Undying Love Eminem- Stan just mind blowing concepts tons more of course from more than just those rappers
22. Why Did you try and compete with Kanye on the 18th? Wouldn't it make more sense to have your album release on a day with less competition?

Cole - Just followed my instincts. I was confident in the album I had. Didn't know what he had, but didn't care. Wanted to start the conversation. I've had a #1 album before. It's cool. But I wouldn't have been able to live with myself wondering "what if I would have moved my date?"
23. Hi J. Cole. I have a few questions for you but first off I would like to say thank you for taking time out of your day to do an AMA here on HipHopHeads. I've been a big fan of yours ever since my friend at school introduced me to some of your songs last year. I really wanted to come to your Atlanta show a couple of days ago and support you and buy some merchandise but I found out that there was an age limit, and I am only 15
What are your favorite things to do outside of rapping?
What job would you like to have if you didn't rap?
What has been the hardest part of your rapping career so far?
Do you think of yourself as "famous" now that you have had two successful albums?
Are you going to be releasing any winter merchandise for Born Sinner? I would really like to have a hoody with the album art on it and wear it all around my campus
Thanks again for doing this AMA, I am looking foward to future album and mixtape releases

Cole - If I didn't rap I have no clue what I would want to do. Would take a lot of self re-evaluating to figure that out. Too much passion for music to think of something else right now
Hardest part of my rap career so far was finding the balance. How to become a mainstream artist without losing myself. Took a lot of experimenting, trying things, sometimes failing. But I found it
Born Sinner CROWN Hoodies on the way
24. What did yourself and Drake do with all those copies of the album you bought?
What was your first feeling when the album leaked so far in advance?

Cole - I don't even know what happened to those copies. Hopefully they gave them out to the people
My first feeling when the album leaked 12 DAYS IN ADVANCE. was "oh fuck"
25. Thank you for doing this AMA J. Cole, to see my favorite rapper come to my favorite online community is really something special
3 days before Sideline Story dropped I was at your concert in Tampa, and you shouted me out at the end while doing Farewell, I was the white kid wearing a Dreamville shirt, here's a picture of me from that night http://imgur.com/dtNJLZ1 When you have your next concert in Tampa, or the closest other venue, I plan on wearing a shirt that says "Produce with J. Cole or Die Trying" I would really just like to get some advice on producing, it's become something I love to do, and you are amazing at it
Anyways, my question for you is how does it feel to have your idol, Nas, rap over your own song, saying that he is proud of you?
Thank you once again, I've been a fan since The Warm Up, and your music has gotten me through some very hard times. Sorry for fan girling, but I've seen in interviews how you've talked about how much you liked Nas as a kid where it felt like you knew him, and that's exactly how I feel about you. Keep making amazing music, and thank you for helping bring back the real

Cole - thank you. i'm going to do a real tour in the fall
I answered the Nas question. Really just wanted to say thank you for listening. And I just heard we beat Edward Snowden for #1 on Reddit. AND I AIN'T HAVE TO BETRAY THE US GOVERNMENT!!! jk jk jk jk (does anyone still use jk.. felt like a 12 year old girl typing that)
26. What are your favorite shows on TV? (More importantly, do you watch Breaking Bad?) lol

Cole - Newsroom is my favorite show. House of Cards too. Breaking Bad is incredible, I only saw the first 2 episodes and planned on watching every episode of every season to catch up. But never had time. So NO, I don't watch it but wish I could
27. Hey Cole. Born sinner is easily the best album that came out on June 18th and your production and rapping was on point. I got two questions for you
1) Why did you decide to not have any guest features spit a verse on Born sinner?
2) When can we expect your collab album with Kendrick?
Thanks for doing this ama Cole!

Cole - Thank you! By the time I was wrapping up the album, I started doing interviews and getting questions about features. I didn't have any rap features, and I felt pressure to ADD some, but quickly realized that I had already said what I wanted to say on this album. The mentality was "who says you HAVE to have other people rapping on your album?"

2) Don't want to put a date on it
28. If you could, would you have done Born Sinner differently?

Cole - nope




[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life's a bitch, the type of chick who likes to kiss and tell
I'd like to switch this life, I'm talking to the wishing well
Tired of missions failed
Why do they wish us well?
Know when they wish us L's
This is hell, but i won't cry like little girls
No, I just keep on dreamin' on
Got a plot to be the greatest, it's the top I'm scheming on
Like a doctor, I got patience, I know it won't be that long
So when all your voices gone, man, I'll still be singing on
(Like)
Say I'm a loser, OK, what, cause i'm losing one round?
Oh, now I'm losing my way? Cause my reviews are thumbs down?
I pay no mind, cause I know time is life's windex
So in due time, you'll see clearly just who gon' raise that index
Finger, Let's see who falls like Jenga
Who gets the glory, boy meets world, let's see who gets Topenga
Man, when you losing nobody gon' talk to you like strangers
Look mama, I made it, won't you know it
Everybody speak my language, yeah, yeah



[J. Cole/Therapist]
Yo, I swear to the nigga above me
I'm-ma make you motherfuckers love me
Even you chumps
Claiming they gon' fuck me-up
Acting like they strapped with gats
They hug me, what
The black needle
Bullets will never touch me once
I ain't no gangsta
I ain't tryna fake the funk
Don't think you've heard of that
My mama ain't raise no punk
So jump!
And get knocked
Like these rhythms too hot
My fists... I'm giving you shots
I know I'm making these hoes
Resort to playing you
You can't see
My crew gon' watch me stampede
You rookie, period!
Bloodying up your panties
I'm like a man without legs
Niggas can't stand me
I'm crooked
Weak niggas should be dumb and they know it
Cause I'm here in the dark
You hearing your heart
Ayo, you ain't writing
Ya mom fighting with mine
I'm like a Tyson fight in his prime
Writing this rhyme
I'm a legend
It ain't where you at
It's where you headed
You niggas is speeding to the dead end
I'm ready
You wanna stop me?
You'll be working forever
That's like tryna sweep dirt from the desert
I ain't murder for cheddar
My purpose is better than that
You motherfuckers ain't veterans
You better relax
I'm ahead of the pack
So I never get slack
When it comes to backing niggas down
I'm better than Shaq
What?



[Intro]
Yo I don't even know man
Maybe I'm the only one who sees how wack this nigga is
Like the rest of these niggas like this nigga or something you know
Fucking 33 years old trying to get respect nigga
Get a life, feed your family man god damn

[Verse]
Why the fuck would you jump to step to
A motherfucker such as myself nigga i deck you
Lay you out beat the shit out you until you confess to
Being the weakest nigga out homosexual, shit
You jock me and talk shit cause you not me
I'm cocky this faggots riding my dick, a jockey
Try me, nigga your shit's jokes you Cosby
I'm Ali, bitch I'm the king you Rodney (Get it)
How dare you try compare yourself to me
Coming at mines you embarrass yourself
So please ease off my dick, worry bout your own shit
I got the skills to pay the bills bitch you homeless
On this microphone it's no joke I'm focused
So, you provoke get throat choked and toasted
You shit is not hot man, god damn yo
You tied for the wackest nigga alive besides Van Gogh
And you hate, how i get props and u can't
Trying to rap at age 48 it's too late
You think you can fuck around but you wait
You great, son you must but slow as a Screw tape
Whats wrong with you, you all bent of shape
Sobbing like your moms whipped you cause i wouldn't do a song with you
Poor slut, washed up, still rapping
How can I call you a has been, you never have been
The most wanted, most boasts but don't want it
The flows rugged, please know I'm cold blooded
This ho done it about to get his dome crushed in
With these words I'm sick, you ain't even got a nose running
Pussy ass artificial [?]
Trying to brag you some kind of fucking central [?]
But, you don't really think that I'm impressed with that do you
I win your wack ass title and give it back to you
Cause it's nothing you still hitting me given me praise
You face me wait, nigga is your weed laced
You too old for this dawg you's a freed slave
You album and Shyne Po got the same release date
You loosing it, I'm bruising lips with this music shit
You gotta get used to it
And now I'm abusing this fucking stupid trick from Houston
Excuse my french but you's a bitch
You's predictable, you joke that I'm half white (Yeah, yeah)
That's nice still don't change the fact that you rap like
You back on the crack pipe, faggots a sad sight
Fag type, sticking flashlights up your ass pipe
You wanted beef so I'm dishing it out son
Before the bout's beginning I'm predicting the outcome
Step in the ring nigga with or without gloves
You be throwing the towel the beginning of round one
And I ain't got no sympathy for you neither
This battles a time out, I'm getting a breather
You easier than 1, 2, 3 your fucking weak raps
Just like my girlfriend, i know i can beat that

[Outro]
What Nigga?
Your whole sets blown
I fuck around and put you in a rest home
I'm professional, this shit is boot camp
I'm a 100 dollar bill you's a food stamp
Ravenous the faggot, the senior citizen with a bad back
A massive limp from his plastic hip
You never could be as nice
This nigga used to have a rap group with Jesus Christ



It's a Cole world, it's no allergies, I'm sick late
Can't underlain, niggas fowlin' me, I switch Haynes'
Switch flows up like Mike Jordan switch hangs
Which explains, I'm the shit, you the shit stain
I'm the type of nigga fuck the baddest and forget name
Meanwhile, you be flyin' 'em out
Me, I just be tryin' 'em out
They love it when you hard on hoes
But I'm Magna Cum Laude, niggas smart on hoes
Which means I seen her intentions
The same time I seen her dimensions
Automatic, I might be leanin' to switches
Got good cop on for sisters, but I'm meaner than bitches
Fuck yeah, won't even leave with the digits to say it's vicious
I say it's necessary for a young legendary
Nigga try to throw you orders, ain't nobody ever taught us
Father, forgive us for the shit we do to your daughters
Up in VIP, poppin' bottles like it's water
Used to ride to Starter
Pardon, cause a part of me just want to save the world
But I don't want to be a martyr
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Caught between a rock and hypogamy always
What's stoppin' me? They say I'm a hypocrisy and doubt me
For God's sakes, better that than be a mockery
Ah, fate, don't talk to me



[Intro: Spoken]
Know I don’t even know man
Think I’m the only one that sees how whack this nigga is
You know what I’m sayin’?
The rest of these niggas, like these niggas
You know? Something you know?
Fucking 33 years old, tryin’ to get respect, man
Man get a job, feed your family man
Goddamn

[Verse 1:]
Yo, yo
Why the fuck would you jump, to step to a motherfucker such as myself?
Nigga I Tec you, lay you out
Beat the shit out of you, til’ you confess to being the weakest nigga out
And homosexual shit, you jock me, and talk shit ‘cause you not me
I’m cocky, this faggots runnin’ my dick, a jockey
Try me, nigga, your shits jokes, you Cosby, I’m Ali
Bitch, I’m the king you Rodney, you get it?
How dare you try comparing yourself to me?
Coming in my [?] embarrassing yourself
So please, ease off my dick, worry ‘bout your own shit
I got skills to pay the bills, bitch, you homeless
On this microphone, its no joke, I’m focused
So, you provoke and throat choke, then toasted
Your shit is not hot man, goddamn yo
You tied for the whackest nigga alive, besides Van Gogh
And you hate, how I get props and you can’t
Tryna rap at age 48, it’s too late
And you fake, you can fuck around, but you ain’t
You cray, son you must be stole like a school tape
Whats wrong wit’ you? You all been out of shape
Sopping like your moms wit’ you
‘Cause I wouldn’t do a song wit’ you? Poor slut
More stuff, still rapping
How can I call you a has been, you never have been?
The most wanted, most boast, but don’t want it
The flows rugged, so please know I’m cold blooded



5 years ago, we started a journey together. On June 15th, 2009 I released The Warm Up to a few who were waiting patiently for it. Full of my dreams, fears and predictions, it resonated with you right away. Over the next year I watched it grow legs and spread at an unbelievable pace all because you felt it so much. Five years later, I couldn’t be more proud of it’s impact. Thank you.

The Warm Up is a declaration of dedication to Greatness. Told from the perspective of a kid who wants more than what his city has to offer him. The crime. The stagnation. He wants more from the girls he dates. He wants out of Muhammad’s house. He refuses to let anyone tell him he can’t dream. That he won’t make it. He believes in himself. He dedicates his life to his craft, because he’s finally realized that the work that you put in today has a direct and absolute impact on the life you live tomorrow.

You heard the passion, you heard the stories, and you believed in him too. You rooted for him. And your’e still rooting. My thoughts today come from my observations over the past 5 years. I understand now that you’re rooting for him, rooting for me, because you are also rooting for yourself. You realize that this society kills dreams and encourages you to conform. To settle for the block, to join the army, to become a lawyer when you really want to paint, to get comfortable in the projects, to slave away at a 9-5 you hate because it pays decent; to become complacent with safety. The Warm Up says, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”

I think about all the times over the past few years that one of you has said to me, “you’re the reason I went to college,” “yo, The Warm Up got me through some hard times,” “got me through law school,” “med school,” “high school,” “The Warm Up changed my life.”

I imagine that 5 years ago we all wanted more. The Warm Up was just something that put music and words to what we were feeling. As I write this I’m on a plane from Sydney, Australia back to New York City. Music has taken me around the world now, doing shows in places I never thought I would be. I’m grateful.

I’m wondering where you are today. 5 years later. The Warm Up dropped when some of you were upperclassmen in college. I’m hoping that you’ve found a career doing some shit you love, something that makes you happy. Maybe you needed more time to figure it out. Grad School? Or maybe you’re back in your parents crib trying to regroup. Everything will be OK. Don’t stop dreaming.

Some of ya’ll were still in high school. If you went on to college, enjoy it while you got it. If you went straight to the real world, I wish you the best. I hope you found a trade you love, or a job that allows you to support yourself. Happiness is all that matters. If you ain’t happy, adjust please.

Some of you were underclassmen in college, which means you probably just entered the workforce or you’re still trying to get that entry level position. These are the toughest times. You will struggle no doubt, but it will all work out in the end.

No matter where you were 5 years ago, I hope that today you are closer to your dreams. I know that everything hasn’t gone exactly the way you planned, it hasn’t for me either. But our job isn’t to plan. Our job includes 3 responsibilities. 1. To dream. 2. To believe that dream is attainable. And 3. To work hard everyday towards that dream. Let God handle the rest.

As you go throughout this week replaying this project that changed my life and lots of yours too, I want to leave you with this because I feel we all need it. Read this as if these words were yours, because they are.

In 5 years I have come so far. I am grateful to be here today, alive and full of potential. But I am not satisfied. I still want more. I still have dreams, even bigger now than before. I will not settle or conform. I rededicate myself to greatness. I give my time and my passion to my craft, because I realize that the work I put in today affects the life that I live tomorrow. I believe in myself. And to all those that doubt me I say, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”

Chorus:
I Just wanna be free
I ain't got time
I just wanna be free
I ain't got time

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights please

[Hook: J. Cole]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

People tell you think about money
People tell you about what it can buy
I tell you I ain't got time
I just want to be free

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"

[Hook: J. Cole]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

People tell you think about money
People tell you about what it can buy
I tell you I ain't got time
I just want to be free
