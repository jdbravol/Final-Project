[Intro: 50 Cent]
I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions
And they all about us

[Intro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shorty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck
But homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll the weed up!
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', "50, you hot."
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You the faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
"Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up."
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Outro]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither
We in the club all the time, so pop, pop off
Shady, Aftermath

[Interlude: 50 Cent and (Lloyd Banks)]
(Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat
Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker)
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
(50, calm down, he coming)
*9 Gunshots*
(Ahh, ohh, what the fuck)
Ah, son, pull off, pull off)

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme somethin' special happen every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say "Only God can judge me," ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pullin' TEC's on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible it says what goes around comes around
"Hommo" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 2: Eminem]
While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking shed, sharpening my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti
Or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginning
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending!
He'll rip your vocal chords out
And have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em
Then plug them motherfuckers-in-each one of your eye sockets
‘Cause I thought you might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up! You’re gonna end up regretting
You ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinking about just saying
"Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!"
‘Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But everytime I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again (shh, shh, shh, shh)
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3AM in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's never gonna end
Now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
I owe you for this one

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sit and politic with passengers from 9/11
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines
Knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends
They know how to pretend

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you're patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit
They ain't sayin' shit — spray 'em, 50!
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, ‘cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier
You now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

[Hook 2: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50 — man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
‘Cause I'll break your face
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you makin' a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets
With all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94: "We don't love them hoes."
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six
Niggas wearin' flags ‘cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood
And filled up with holes, motherfucker

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 1]
Now, shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies
They pay her, ‘cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country
Think she like me ‘cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid!
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her
When I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
You sayin' it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch
She always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
‘Cause I need four TV's and AMG's for the six
Ho make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

[Outro]
Yeah, in Hollywoood they say
"There's no b'ness like show b'ness."
In the hood they say
"There's no b'ness like hoe b'ness," you know?
They say I talk a little fast
But if you listen a little faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, uh-huh
They don't do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I’m used to the bullshit, it don’t matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So which you want, the cheese or the cheeks
You want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat
I’m havin’ the epiphany you niggas ain’t shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I’m from
I’m a Southside nigga, yeah I’m ‘bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come outline
You ain’t made of what I’m made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch, her shoes come from Bakers
Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?

[Hook: 50 Cent]
We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop
Y’all don’t do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Good pussy for dinner, bomb kush for breakfast
D colored VS stones around my neck bitch
It feels like a nigga dreamin’
Seat back, music bumpin’, niggas leanin’
Bulls eye, that’s what we came for
The bread, now a nigga run the game boy
I should’ve sent the broad to report what’s in the yard
Aloof livin’, I came up so hard
No pain, no gain, it’s embedded in the brain
I’m in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kidd Kidd]
‘Round the world tourin’, the city got boring
Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans
Coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange
Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses
Living life with no worries
My gun got a Zodiac sign, it's a Taurus
Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e
M-Zone Rida Gang end the story
Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry
She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury
Everything you aren't, fly nigga soaring
Purple label Ralph Lauren, kick game like Atari
You so special, bedroom or restroom
Just keep performing, go girl
About to film a movie, guess who's starring



[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We trying to make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'mma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'till I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop

[Interlude: Sonny Digital]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

Aye, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money
Shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shorty wanna fuck with me
Stripping, yeah, the jiggy, nigga

Nigga like me, I be with the shit
Try and stick me I'mma get you hit
Yeah, you know just how I get down
Bad bitches around, they smoking and they drinking
And I'm thinking it can all work out
Seen your bitch back blown out
It's never nothing personal, believe me
I fuck around, your bitch don't wanna leave me
She talking 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town
Not around, she want me to fly in to put it down
It's nothing to a real nigga, had that ass flying in first class
Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothing regular
Turn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass
You know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now

[Intro]
It's 50 a.k.a. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

[Verse 1]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
If D's ran up in my crib you know who droppin' dimes

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

[Verse 2]
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
If you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

[Bridge]
Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

[Verse 3]
'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I gotta eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murk 50, how?
We ridin' round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'



[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We tryna make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'ma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'til I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop

[Interlude: Chris Brown]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Ay, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money, shit changed over money

A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shawty wanna fuck with me
Strippin', yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Later, she gon' hit my line
We ain't gon' waste no time
She suckin' and we fuckin' like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy

We gettin' it on then I'm gone
It's the type of shit that a nigga be on

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Too much on my mind right now

Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Came in the game gettin' money
I fuck with all the bitches gettin' money
But you love playin' games with the corny shit
Messin' with a nigga, only bought it 'cause I want it
You love to see a nigga at the bottom
You tried to come up, you don't keep it on the low
They like a drug, don't like you to call them hoes
I'm tryna break a booty down like 36 O's
I think I love a big fat A-O-D, make that bitch cum for free
Look at mommy shake it, I'ma call her, she gon' hit my line, fall in love every time
But if I don't pay, she gon' leave me, never had a real reason, all I get is bits and pieces
And I believe it, I ain't think this shit was easy, who am I now?

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Lookin' for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now

Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Know I'm the man, hoe I'm the man
Think she ain't special, watch how she change for a nigga, oh naw
They not on my level, that's why I look at you different, yeah, yeah



[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Hook]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over, again and again

[Verse 1]
When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'mma break it down iller
See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Roley, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by 26, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the Mac will



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, uh huh
So seductive

[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working, baby, no problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh huh)

[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Olivia]
Girl, what we do, what we do
And where we do, and where we do
The things we do, things we do
Are just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
‘Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gonna sip that heavy bubble, man, every bottle is gone

[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa



[Intro]
Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape
(I've waited I've waited, time went by
What I'll do is cry silly, silly)

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend,
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)

Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 1]
First we get to talkin, then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)

Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend
(Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend



[Sample: Maze]
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

[Intro]
Yea, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in "New Jack," I holla "Cancel that bitch!"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiending
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[Hook]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man

[Hook]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumping, shotgun dumping
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupe switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty "BS" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, "Look at Niggaraci" - hello

[Hook]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)



[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

[Verse 1]
I apply pressure to pussies that stunting I pop
Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop 9's
Tell niggas get they money right, ‘cause I got mine
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump – is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone

[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm down for the action, he smart wit' his mouth so smack him
You holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin'
‘Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking what happened
Oh no, look who clapped 'em with the .44
20 inch rims sitting on Low-pro’s
Eastside, Westside, niggas know, yo, I’m loco
Even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit – we get it popping in the hood
G-Unit – motherfucker, what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act
I had a sip of too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the MAC, thinking it's all rap, 'til that ass get clapped and Doc say, "It's a wrap" (It's a wrap, nigga!)

[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

[Verse 3]
I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go 'head, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, ya heard me?
When streetlights come on niggas blast the 9's
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's ups and downs so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma who always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the drop-out who made more money than these teachers
Roofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it, fuck it!

[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby
[Spoken Outro]



[Intro Skit]
Man 1 : Aye, you want some of this shit?
Man 2 :  Naw, I don't want that shit
Man 1 :  I don't give a fuck. I don't play that shit, and I'm finna' buss a cap in a nigga
Man 2 : Man, shut the fuck up! Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga's crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. Imma get in the other car. Aight
Car revs up
Gunshots

[Hook]
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'mma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

[Verse 1]
Keep thinking I'm candy 'till ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying "Lord, Jesus help me" cause they ass leaking
When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood
Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
Cause I get tired of looking for ya, spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me

[Hook]
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out

The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'mma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

[Verse 2]
My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride 'till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rain
Oh, you a pro at playing battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains

[Hook]
If there's beef cock it and dump it

I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

[Bridge]
After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me
If you don't wanna get shot I suggest you don't go testing me
All the wrong I've done the Lord still keep on blessing me
Fin'nin to run rap cause Dr. Dre got the recipe

[Outro]
Yeah, uh ha, aye Dre
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
Cause my windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga
Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga
Cause my motherfuckin hat is bulletproof, nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fucking concussion
Better that then a hole in the head right, nigga?



[Intro]
Ohh!
The top feel so much better than the bottom
So much better

[Hook]
Ja, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Jada, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Joe, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nas, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1]
Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Hook]
Ja, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Jada, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Joe, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nas, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 2]
Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, "Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang."
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

[Hook]
Ja, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Jada, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Joe, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nas, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by



[Hook]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

[Verse 1]
Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must cease existing, little nigga, now listen
Your mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase them
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha ha, pussy

[Hook]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

[Verse 2]
"The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around"
That's Ja's little punk ass thinking out loud
Southside 'til I die, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child
Them niggas dead, they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back better than ever on top of my game
Even them country boys saying "50 we feeling you, mane"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy

[Hook]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

[Verse 3]
I ain’t gonna' tell nobody you pussy
I ain’t gonna' tell nobody you getting extorted
I've been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "The 50 Cent Show"
This is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down cause you fear for your life
But you heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, nigga
(They not gon' like you)
I know, I know

[Outro]
Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja
Okay? Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put their hands on Jeffrey
Okay, first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pink belt
Okay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery
Okay, cause see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?
Okay, I though so
Cause you know that I know karate, and I will see him
And I will Jet Li his ass, hitaaaah!



[Intro]
G-Unit, we in here
We can get the drama popping, we don't care
It's going down cause I'm around
50 Cent, you know how I gets down

[Hook]
What up, blood?
What up, cuz?
What up, blood?
What up, gangsta?
What up, blood?
What up, cuz?
What up, blood?
What up, gangsta?

[Verse 1]
They say I walk around like I got an S on my chest
Nah, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You getting money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it, the Mac I blast it
D's come we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood

[Hook]
What up, blood?
What up, cuz?
What up, blood?
What up, gangsta?
What up, blood?
What up, cuz?
What up, blood?
What up, gangsta?

[Bridge]
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around

[Verse 2]
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas

[Hook]
What up, blood?
What up, cuz?
What up, blood?
What up, gangsta?
What up, blood?
What up, cuz?
What up, blood?
What up, gangsta?

[Bridge]
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bomb cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause

[Hook]

[Outro]
Shady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit
Rap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over



[Chorus: 50 Cent & Chris Brown]
Ayo, quit Captain Savin', serenadin' them hoes

Hey hoe, get back to twerkin', back to workin'
Get back to strippin', they back to tippin'

Quit fuckin' around, not playin' around, bitch, shit is for real
Quick makin' a stack, back makin' some mill, I mean, get us a deal
Bitch, fix us a meal, tell me how does it feel?
On the social network when they said a nigga really ain't got no chill

[Pre-Chorus: 50 Cent & Chris Brown]
He think he fuckin' my bitch, nigga, that bitch for rent

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
P.I.M.P, who the shotta them

Tag yo shit, we goin' up on the Instagram
Higher than a ceilin' fan, I'm whippin' bricks in the kitchen
I'm flyin' shit out the window like I was Peter Pan
I handle my own shit, I own shit
Alone shit, middle finger to the middle man
Anybody that can get it when they want it
Finger fuckin' bitches, she gon tell me when she cummin'

That's my OG, if a nigga trippin', get to bustin'
Mo money mean mo problems
If your nigga got the money, we gon' rob him
Boy, I'm simply, a P.I.M.P
And I'ma let it go 'til the clip go empty

[Pre-Chorus: 50 Cent & Chris Brown]
He think he fuckin' my bitch, nigga, that bitch for rent
He know how to treat a hoe, I mean all that money spent
She say you a sweetheart, a sweetheart
Things tend to go a little different round here, we pimpin' nigga

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I'm gettin' big money, started goin' hard, keep a nigga from hatin'
I’m with a white bitch, nigga Google this shit we interracial datin'
This is a new wave, I'm a new Wraith, my nigga sit on suede
Like I'm Special Ed, but I ain't Special Ed, bitch, I got it made
We here to make the paper, hope you niggas on the same page
You know boy in the hood'll have you runnin' like Ricky from the 12 gauge
You know my bottom bitch, I done told her how to break a nigga 12 ways
A few tricks a day, that there keep the bill collectors away
You hear my name on the street, circulatin', you heard I'm cakin'
These niggas try to compete, perpetratin', what's percolatin'?
I got game for days, ask around, they tell you I put it down
So a hoe feel like I'm right next to her when a nigga way up town

[Pre-Chorus: 50 Cent & Chris Brown]
He think he fuckin' my bitch, nigga, that bitch for rent
He know how to treat a hoe, I mean all that money spent
She say you a sweetheart, a sweetheart
Things tend to go a little different round here, we pimpin' nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Chris Brown]

She report to pimpin', nigga back to trickin'

[Intro]
Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
Cause I don't like y'all anyway
Man, I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?
Even bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
Cause the shit I floss with is saying a lot for me

[Verse 1]
I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me they don't even stash tracks
They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke and sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My picture's painted the words that make a blind man see

[Hook]
Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder your life's on the line

[Bridge]
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
I'm trying to figure out how y'all started me
You gon' make me catch you on the late night
Pop shots with the fifth and slide off in the six

[Verse 2]
I'm not a marksmen while sparking so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga, but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear "he say, she say" shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck with me get shot up
Do it Cali style, drive by and tear ya block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood they be like "Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em"
You heard that shit? "Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em"
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You're just a small player in this game, play your part, son

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car, NASCAR
Truck with a crash bar and TV's in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five with stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't trying
I ain't lying, I sip Dom P til I spit up, keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up
Now if you say my name in your rhyme you better watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars
50, umm... Jay-Z and Nas
Imma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners, and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playing, you get killed like that
Acting like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, what?

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Intro]
Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

[Hook]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up, niggas holla "Roll up!"
And I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money, you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em Girls
Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

[Hook]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Bridge]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high, be high
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high, be high
But I twist that lye, lye lye lye


[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit!"
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

[Hook]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me, who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then Oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga? Go ahead, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so, ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

[Hook]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Outro]
G-Unit, are you ready? G-Unit, are you ready?
G-Unit, are you ready? Nigga, ready or not, here I come, come, come

[Intro: The Madd Rapper & 50 Cent]
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn-style, boy, you know what I'm saying?
R.I.P B.I.G - nigga R.I.P P.A.C - R.I.P
Enough of that shit, it's time to O.D, one time

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
The bottom line is I'm a crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'mma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?
Get your ass down to the nearest ATM''
I have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine
Since these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, "Tell your man"
Mason Betha, haha, come up off that watch now, I mean right now
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB, but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped
What, Jigga just sold like four milli, got something to live for
Don't want a nigga putting four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll manhandle Case like "dope, get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no more, where you getting chips from now?"
I been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah for real son I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gonna catch me, son?

[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'll catch P and Silkk The Shocker right after the Grammy's
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound
Like you give me the cash, you put the hot dog down
I figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before
That's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
My attitude while robbing J.D.? Fuck you, pay me
Had Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down, well, you tell, homie
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave
Catch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up
Fuck the cab, the coroners picking 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga I saw you
He said "Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for ya"
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, "Even my gold teeth?"
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep
One at a time, get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'mma keep sticking niggas until I'm living
I'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens
I'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee
That nigga still eating off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enough, I told him "gimme some more"
Is you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's people

[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Outro: The Madd Rapper]
For real, yo, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas got to get stuck up, that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga or a bitch
It don't matter if you got it and I need it I want it
You know what I'm saying? That's just how it go down
50 Cent ain't fucking around, Trackmasters ain't fucking around
Crazy Cat ain't fucking around, The Madd Rapper ain't fucking around
You know what I'm saying?
So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets
Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus
Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not



[Hook: 50 Cent (Snoop Dogg)]
I'm trying to move 1 brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more
I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks, raw
(I smoke one ounce staring at the caddy on the showroom floor
Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more, boy)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Run tell the Bloods I’m crippin', go tell the Crips I’m Blood
Nigga, I be trippin', bitch, I don't give a fuck
I put the K on niggas, I spray on niggas
Come through 2012 XJ on niggas
I'm an apex predator, nigga, I'm stronger
Shooters on deck, I break bread and they on ya
Niggas said I fell off, oh, you heard I fell off?
Why the fuck would you be repeating that?
Nigga, I'm a rap tycoon, make a 100 mill by June
Now who the fuck said I can't rap, Jay?
I'm in a dope fiend's dream, I got it for 'em raw
I got that morphine memories, I've been breaking the law
I was born a burner, in the stroller with the llama
I'm violent, I kill a nigga, put that on my mama
Nah, nah, don't tell me nothing about none of these niggas
I smoke all these niggas for this bread

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I give a fuck about a fed as I jump up outta bed
5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, yeah
I'm trying to put this shit away on the low
I need a hit a day, think you better get away
From my, oh, my, I got a birdie that'll fly
From Cali to Kingston, back to NY
Snoop's smash the kush, from 5 to 9
Come by and get you some pounds and now you flying high
Run with the metal with my foot to the pedal
G's with the trees and the C's on my level
5-0, you know I go hard, these fools call me Bogart
Head nigga in charge, these niggas soft as DeBarge
But I ain't tripping, I'm just flipping my cheese
Cause if you really want the bomb come and fuck with your G's
I got it, always kill, always will
Had that, sit that, my nigga get that, you hear that?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
5 AM in the kitchen, nigga, I'm coughing
Bag full of white 8 balls, I'm going golfing
Now homie got killed last night, bought him a coffin
Retaliated the same night, made him a dolphin
Guess that's the life of a yay' flipper
Choppers making your ass get naked just like a stripper
Got cameras for the jackers, home invaders, man
Them niggas coming all black like they Raiders fans
All I saw growing up was kilos and gangbanging
Then the homie taught me to whip, gamechanging
Now I'm breaking down birds on the coffee table
Yeah, and half them bitches sold 'fore they off the table
Gotta look, nigga wantin' my half, I’m gonna split it
The type of nigga work that visit like it's a skillet
Less Soda, more water, stretching like it's elastic
Weigh it up in 250's, wrap it up in plastic, yeah

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, you know what it is. It's your cripping cousin, 5-O. Anytime you need that mothafuckin' smoke, you know I got it, cuz. You need 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds? Whatever you need, you know I got it. And if them niggas out there in the NY need it give 'em my connect so I can hook them niggas up with that. Ooh wee, ooh wee! We tryna move this shit, cuz. For real though. I got too much of this shit, homie. Yeah, I'm Bob Marley reincarnated. Jah! Rastafari!



[Hook: Joe]
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation

[Hook: Joe]
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

[Hook: Joe]
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

I'm up early in the mornin', tryna make a move
Come in here with me shorty take your lil' on the school
Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma
I hit her with the llama to get this cake
Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
But she don't know it, damn, OK we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
Put a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home
You was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you
That the nine will jam right in my hand

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
I got his homies screamin' Buck you need to calm down
Niggas be gettin' killed everytime you come around
We ran up in his crib, made his momma kiss the ground
She askin' God, what my baby done did now?
I'm takin' everything, jewellery I want it all
Duct tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waitin' we gon' starve waitin' on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new Jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fuckin' sidewalk
And I'mma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga left
G-Unit soldier I'm thuggin' till my death

[Hook: 50 Cent]

WOO!!! From the midst of the dark barkin it's Bill Gates
From the behind the bodega with two eights
I mean, with intentions of settin yo' ass straight
I mean, yo' ass leakin, bleedin reachin for faith
I mean, you barely breathin, with your soft survivin ass
What happen to your hood vibe with your good ridin ass
What happen to the gangsta that you see on TV

That bitch there a door knob, nigga, we all get a turn
Fuck you catching feelings for? I mean when your ass'll learn?
That pussy community, community

[Verse 1]
While you be all in her DM, nigga
I be all in that BM with her
You be all in your feelings 'bout it
Like "when I see him I'mma kill this nigga"
I'm on three-way like, "you hear this nigga?"
I should take the bitch back and clip the nigga
Pussy make him not pay attention
You punk bitch go with this nigga
I throw bands, bitch, these hoes love me
I fuck a bad bitch 'till she ugly
Put the pussy in recovery
I’m like, "now what you think of me?"
Niggas goin’ out just to talk to these hoes
Blowin’ big bankrolls on clothes
Now they wonder where the money at
Yeah, the motherfucking money that they had from the re-up gone
I don't do no stalkin'
I don't cuff no hoes, tell a bitch keep walkin'
I don't do much talkin'
Right now I'm flossin', I do this often
Gotta flex on a bitch
Tag team, I got next on a bitch (I got next)
I ain't stressing a bitch
But every now and then I blow a check on a bitch

[Hook]
Drop that ho back off in her hood, too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Drop that ho back off at that club, I'm too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Shawty playin', she lame for that
She ain't have to put a nigga name in that
Beefin' over these bitches, not me
Nah, nigga, I ain't came for that
We don't talk to no pillows, nigga
We brought all these bitches with us
You act like you got all the hoes
But all I see is niggas with you
She don't like when you pullin' on her
She like me, I'm pullin' up
I act like I don't want her
You act like you can't get enough
That bitch there like dopeboys
If you got money she goin' for it
I drink that hoe, her head so good
She gon' have you there like, "oh lawd"
All this time you ain't on
I done bought her shit you can't afford
She take pictures with your money
But you tell her she can't do it
All you niggas don't panic
I'm just tryna understand it
I must take these hoes for granted
Or you niggas just so romantic

[Hook]
Drop that ho back off in her hood, too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Drop that ho back off at that club, I'm too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)

NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (When it's on that's who you get, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (That's your motherfucking clique, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (You a motherfucking snitch, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna shine like me (Me)
Rhyme like me (Me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (Me)
They want to do it 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Ayo, you think about shittin' on fifty, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King Davids
I teach niggas sign language, that ain’t deaf, son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at ya car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It’s nothing, I can go after Mase’s fan base
Shell hitted my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like "Fiddy, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

[Hook] x2
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

[Verse 2]
Mama said everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk to him I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy cause I don't fear man
Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
32 karats in the cross, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony Carry, my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me
I'm the one

[Hook] x2
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

[Verse 3]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it’s special y'all
A country boy tell 'ya "I’m fiend to blow"
I’m more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I’m in this for the paper, but I don’t love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know 'em little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won’t you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching, you watching me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me?

[Hook] x2
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

Get a tan, I'm already black, rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a river rat, shit, fuck the chitter chat

You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new though
I got rid of my old bitch, now I got new hoes
First it was the Benzo, now I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari, I'm sorry, I keep blowing up
They call me the cake man, the strawberry shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole clique break dance
Backspin, head spin, flatline, you're dead then
9 shells, Mac-10, "who wanna get it cracking?"
I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh, you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they calling me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they calling me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck, man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like bloaw, you like my style
Ha ha - I'm heading to the bank right now

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah, yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a Teflon Don, boy, I run New York
When I come outta court, yeah, I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid

[Outro]
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (Yeah)
Whoa, hey (I run New York)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)

Money I got, money I got
(Like all the time)
I get money, money I got
(Trying to stop my shine)
I get money, money I got

Money I got, money I got

Yeah, yeah)



[50 Cent]
Yeah, it's 50
One shot, one kill, what's the deal
Yeah, what's the deal

[Hook]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
N ain't playin', when it rains it pours
N get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' changed, n doin' the same ol' shit
Them new hollow tips in them same ol' clips
In the projects, n fuck with the same ol' chicks
For somehow, they still think that they game is so sick
Now from the rip, n know I'm 'bout my grip
I don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I say, "I don't need you bitch"
Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'mma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a n?
She just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some, I say hell naw!
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
To keep yo' mind on yo' money
And don't trust no bitch
Ke Ke hit high notes, when them pigs came
But her ass kinda fat, so n treat' her the same
This is real

[Hook]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
N ain't playin', when it rains it pours
N get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Blood stains on my stoop, when Akbar got shot
When homocide outside, nigga I'm not
This the third time them niggas done circled the block
It's money out now yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale
They say, "tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail"
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And say what's up to the sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of n tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
To Ace to the duece, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull up's in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck

[Hook]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
N ain't playin', when it rains it pours
N get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

(Gun shots, police sirens and helicopters going off
While it thunders and rains)

On the late night, till daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
(Let me talk to you)

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new age, you're like my new craze

The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype, and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
(Let me talk to you)

Thousand for these fucking Margielas (you better watch your step)
Hundred thousand chains on my chest, yeah
Ice on my rings, ice, yeah, you see me shining

Ferrari, Ferrari

Shooter, shooter
Shooter, shooter

[Verse]
I was innocent then, I ain’t do no wrong
She said, “you mommy little man,” I said, “yep, uh huh”
She was everything to me, when she came, I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up
It was welfare or hustlin', they killed her for that
The first shot, bullet wound in my back
I’m fucked up, look at my sneakers, I’m fucked up
Now I’m on my own, mommy gone
Sam said, “you a young boy, why your clothes look so old?
You don’t need fish, little nigga, you need a pole
You need no new kicks, you need an O”
Chop that, bag it, get right back at it
That touched me, it hit me in my heart
I’m a hustler, homie, you was giving me my start
I am what I am, Sabrina’s only baby
Practicing in the mirror, pulling out my .380
Oh man, I fucked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will, see
Seven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look, I’m outta control, my gun go
Off like it’s legal, call the cops, you need to
Give ‘em my description, I ain’t bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn’t last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left, in case niggas try to get me
That’s nine shots, we just call it fifty

[Outro]
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
Mama said, mama said
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
Then in came the landlord, beef, and the stresses
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
Mama said, mama said
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
The dope bought the shit the food stamps couldn’t get us
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
That’s what mama said, that's what mama said

Shyne poppin off his mouth from a cell
He don't want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I'm in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It's an emergency, for Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you, cuz
First thing they say about you is you's a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I'll give you what I got

Get to kissin and touchin a lil' bit

When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man

I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin, party jumpin, I said loud and clear

The working man is a tough guy

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I woke up this morning thinking ’bout the old me
When I was feeling like Miller Lite and Ol' E
But now I ride on some conscious shit
I’m getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I could have a problem with is myself
That’s probably why my only competition is myself
From today to tomorrow
The Doc is just rocking the same drum
Fuck the past, though I ain’t forgot where I came from
I got the club rocking, uh
I got your girl jocking, uh
Me and Fif’ still in this bitch, bitch
We going the distance with you party people come’on

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now, you can get your knees on the church floor, pray it get﻿ better
Or push the dough on the liquor store, see where it get ya
But me, I got to be on top
I said, me I get to be on top
I got the street on lock
I’m on automatic pilot, ain't nobody stopping me
Growing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny
Niggas ride, I don’t hide, I dump to get 'em off of me
I’m a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I’m from the bottom
Soon as I spot ‘em I get to drop ‘em
I got ‘em; the competition, red-dot 'em
It’s dinner time when the 9 come out
It’s off with the chain, off with the ring
Move, bang, off with ya brain

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Marks on the wall
It’s now or never at all
I’m gonna give it my all
Whether I rise or fall

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
True story, I said I’d get rich or die trying
I did it, good luck sucker, trying to stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music, music my first love
We paper chasing -- I’m always coming in first, cuz
I’m built for it, see I’m better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I’m coming to get ya
I got to win, Em watch and Dre watch and my son watching
Fuck that, losing ain't an option
I’m sharp I’m on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
I’m back on my A-game
I’m focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that I’m stronger than an ox now mentally

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

When I'm out in N.Y., boy, it's blunts and Phillies
When I'm out in L.A., boy, it's wraps and Swishers
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]
I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too
My Teflon on, boy, my government issue
I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane

[Hook]
I'm laughing straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold
I'm internationally known, it's the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto'
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general; salute me soldier

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now work it out now, shorty work it out
I wanna see you, break it down
Now back it up now, you know what I'm about
It's like a bank job I'm in and I'm out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out

She moan and groan when I get it, she tell me lick it, I did it

We get to talkin' and touchin', we get to lickin' and stickin'
Now, now you know what we doing, when you're around and we missin'
We go through perfect positions, we get it poppin', now listen
Too much pleasure to measure, she got the power to beat it
Make her wanna give it to me in that major way

[Hook]
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up (x4)

You can smoke a blunt and kick it like Kung Fu
Goin' crazy on this pussy, on your nut too
You done got 3 or 4, I'm tryna nut too
She talk that shit she got a awful mouth
Nigga hit her one time at the waffle house
Right up in the IHOP
But it definitely wasn't my spot
Look at all these bitches, where the bad ones at?
You know I hate a mad ho, where the glad ones at?
I'm tryna dick some women when the club close
Look at Jizzle, got the phantom full of club hoes
Yeah, Jizzle in his baseball cap
'Bout to beat the pussy up, nigga baseball bat

[Hook] (x4)

[T.I.]
Beat that pussy up, jab, jab, right hook
Send her home to her man, let 'em watch The Notebook
Shorty wanna hang, I'm a coat hook
Split that thing down the middle of the roll up
Shown up, Gucci down to the shoe lace
Hundred carats in the chain, no fugaise
Hoes still sweat a nigga on a cool day
Them other sucker niggas fake as April Fool's Day
And a rich nigga gotta pay, that(s) what you say
I got bitches from the bay to the UK
Thick with it, pussy sweet like Kool-Aid
Run abroad, then I let her bust two straight
No suitcase on the PJ runway
Me plus two, thats a G4 three way
I give her man a hard time
He gotta soft six and I gotta hard nine

[Hook] (x4)



[50 Cent]
She loves me, she loves me not
Yeah, she loves me not

[Verse 1]
The fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now you tryin' to leave me, you never live without me
Girl I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back bitch, don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[Verse 2]
Baby you know, on the low, ya sister been eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know soon she be tryin' me
Heard she bi-sexual, she fuck what that girl
But boy, oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing
Kurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this ain't new
I live the lavish life, listen if the mood is right
Me you and ya sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, if you hyper I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, your reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back, no one said lovin' me be easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I love you, I got you bare footed on glass, chasin a dove
That monkey on ya back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to them
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up when you down, then they got nothin' to say
But when you call up, I come runnin', I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down, you crowned, you prom queen
They know bout me behind your back, call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you, no other man can love you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And I see to that, I'mma do whatever it takes

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, Shady
Aftermath
G-UNIT!!

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in you

[Verse 1]
You mistakin' me for somebody that you should be testin'
You should be stressin', I'm finna fuckin' teach you a lesson
Rap 101's in session, Em laced the track that I'm blessin'
Smith & Wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin'
Cappin' 'em, kept in my Benz, hot beginning to end
Watch the 22's spin, my hoes they perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best, don't you get it? Forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in yo' ass, bitch!
If it's not a classic when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered, stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard
When measures get drastic, Glocks made out of plastic
Cock it, aim it, blast it, run nigga, now stash it

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in you

[Bridge]
If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
I'ma drink 'til I get to that bitch
Em and Dre gonna introduce me to the 'burbs
They gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit (Break it down!)

[Verse 2]
Picture a perfect picture, picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me startin' shit, picture me bustin' my gat
Picture police mad, they ain't got a picture of that
Picture me bein' broke, picture me smokin' a stack
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me goin' back
To my momma basement to live, shit, picture that
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target, Jack
Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back
50 Cent, too much Henny, man I'm bent, I'm outta here

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in you

[Outro]
Man, I ain't' goin' to jail, not even to visit a nigga
You wanna holler at me you write me
Matter of fact you gotta send it to Sunset Blvd up in the Mondrian
Ridin' around in one of Dre's Ferrari's, nigga
Oh, matter fact, I might be in Detroit ridin' down 8 Mile Road
You know, in one of Em's joints and shit, ya heard?
I got places to go, man, ya know
Shady Aftermath, we finna start printin' money
Puttin' Em's faces on these motherfuckin' bills, shit
Ain't shit you can do about it



[Intro: Trey Songz]
Somebody pull the fire alarm, girl, where you from?
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke
All they smell is smoke, girl, they smellin' smoke
All they smell is smoke
The way your body roll, I'ma lose control
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke
All they smell is smoke, girl, they smellin' smoke
All they smell is smoke

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feelin' Hoover
She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample
That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin', we smokin'
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin' the word is
Me, I'm a P.I.M.P
I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police comin', you like, put this shit out

[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]
You like smoke and you got me high
You make a nigga want to get down
High
High feelin' like I'm up in a cloud
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high
So high make your love come down
High
One time, have that ass turnt out
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Shawty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to workin' her hips, you know the temperature rise
Oh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin' damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation, pimpin' ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin' crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
Luther said it: a house is not a home without her
I had 'em panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wantin' is temporary 'cause for sure she gon' get it, wassup

[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]
You like smoke and you got me high
You make a nigga want to get down
High
High feelin' like I'm up in a cloud
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high
So high make your love come down
High
One time, have that ass turnt out
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Everybody showin' the love when she at the door
Turn this bitch down, that's fire in the hole
I'm tryina get it and hit it, I don't wanna pass that
Got me addicted, I'm trippin', where the stash at?
Baby, baby, don't you know?
Baby, baby, you're just like smoke

[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]
And you got me high
So high
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high
Ring the alarm it's on
High
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
Ring the alarm it's on
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

[Outro: 50 Cent & Trey Songz]
Ring the alarm it's on
Smoke, you're like smoke
My nigga, wassup?



[Produced by Medi and G Rocka]

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nigga, you pussy, you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here?
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
We ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit
I want the bread, you want the bitch
Come out your mouth slick I'll get you hit
My niggas hungry, they hit a lick
Fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip
We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
I caught a A1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute
Truth be told these niggas is hoes
Once the shit set off, man, anything goes
Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie
If you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
30 something and you ain't never open your mouth yet
Social media is giving cowards an outlet
See him in person, say something, I doubt that
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that
Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
You stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words
Literally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt
Pussy your whole life, you always been a bird
Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
Screw 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves
And I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge
And I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible
Nigga, you vaginal

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Money for bail, money to bail
Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell
FEDs on my coat tail, snitches given court tales
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house
Niggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about
I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out
Bang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'
Stankin' like shipments, over my shillings
Up your security, Rida gang in the building

[Hook]



[Intro]
Ah-ha man! Ayy you know where them niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse 1]
This is not new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day same shit, old mac new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my tec
Go on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with son
'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo' life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse 2]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn - niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's eighty-one one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
YEAH!

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight



[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out My Melody"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 2: The Game]
I told Dre from the gate "I'd carry the heat for ya"
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my dope Nwa gold
I had the whole crowd yellin "Free Yayo!"
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?

[Hook: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
From the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club 'til they coughin on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt and my coat
Now I'm speedin, reminiscin; holdin my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'mma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

[Hook: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 5: Tony Yayo]
I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus, rockin a leases
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life, thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

[Verse 6: Young Buck]
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout I'm born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a worthy check

[Hook: 50 Cent & Young Buck]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, this is insane
Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no suprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I done went legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self and my back, God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out
Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave while you're up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics

[Hook]
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on
Hold on

[Verse 2]
We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds
But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one
Used to do graffiti, now look we major
Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor
Re-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb
This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure coca leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money coming in like we run the streets

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride?
Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride
Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined
We don't want your block, just cop your work from us
Those niggas you call allies can't be trust
That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard 'Ya smacked the shit outta a kid
Now Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again
When it's war, it'll be war to the bitter end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
That sneaky nigga spray that Semi at your momma crib
With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
It's on now, nigga
Welcome to hell
My hood, there's no telling
What they do to you
Across the street from Lucifer, he's only tough who...
Stupid nigga, you be using the blame
When the fif start to flame you'll be losing your brain

[Bridge]
And your boss is a bitch
He snitched on Levar
Junebug's a fucking flunky
I don't trust him, either

[Hook 1 x2]
Eeney meeney miney mo
Catch a piggy by the toe
Click clack pow, officer down

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
On the block , knocking down , taking shit getting real
In the block takin streets , Spin head for the hills
Now you talk that shit , but is you bout it dog
Respect the full rank , you ain't know lil dog

[Hook 2]
Eeney meeney miney mo
If you catch a piggie when you get it let it go
And get on down along the road
Eeney meeney miney mo
Eeney meeney miney mo
Aaaaah Officer down



[Intro: Havoc]
It's the Infamous Mobb, M-O-B-B
We can't be touched nigga, can't you see (G-Unit)

[50 Cent]
You do you man cause me I'm 'gon do my thing, you know I do my thing
I'mma get my drink on and party like it's ok

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, "Oh no"
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

[Verse 2: Havoc]
You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some pop shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I play, I stay I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

[Intro]
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse 1]
Your daddy fucked your mama then fucked your sister
Then climbed in your bed playing with your shitter
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter of fact grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick, you know the one everybody's on
You 'gon make me sing ''Murder Was The Case''
Bullets ricochet *ping ping*, shoot the star off your face
I'm international, I'm never home, mane
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with, mate
Or you 'gon make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on, Game, you will never be my equal
Your homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people
See me I'm what you never 'gon be
I'm in that tax bracket you never 'gon see

[Hook]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse 2]
That nigga Buck like Gator, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pimp C
Man keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs' didn't sell like his CDs'
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on them breezies
Mad cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look I don't give a fuck, nigga, please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, "50, nah, I don't fuck with him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy"
It's funny how they shit on me cause them they need me
See me I'm number one, I'm loading up my gun
I catch ya and you done, you pussy nigga run

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say first comes love then comes marriage
Instead I got Shaniqua in a baby carriage
Then came the cash then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill, she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man, I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, damn even my dad
And I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?
I ain't giving nobody shit, I'mma show them
I gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick
Started screaming Westside and Dre ain't say shit
Now we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me here's the case
''Enemies stay enemies but friends they change
Niggas go crazy over money, my mane''

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up, then cage me
I come back bigger, stronger and angry

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'
Pick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood till EMS
Come pick you up, you know you're fucked when you get on the stretcher
Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me
They lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get, a nine, then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[50 Cent]
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, he bleeding wheezing, breathing he half dead
He must ain't know, but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn

[Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub

[50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

[Hook]



[Hook: 50 Cent]
Don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She's feeding fools fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country; think she like me cause I'm from New York?
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch: hit the track, catch a date, and come pay the kid
Look baby, this is simple, you can't see?
You fuckin' with me you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[50 Cent]
G-G-G-Unit!

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
F-I-F-T-Y C-E-N-T and S-N double O-P
Doggy style in your mouth for the 2003
And y'all know I'm from the DPG

F-I-F-T-Y C-E-N-T and S-N double O-P
We internationally known and locally respected
(And you know you're just a P.I.M.P!)
Now what you know about me?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah bitch, I got my Now and Later gators on
I'm bout to show you how my pimp hand is way strong
Your dead wrong if you think that pimpin' gonna die
12-piece with a hundred hoes by my side
I'm down with that nigga 50 like I'm down with blue
(We love you Snoop Dogg!) Yeah, I love you too
G-U-N-I-Tizzy, fuckin' with me and the D-P-Gizzy
Niggas in New York know how Doggy get down
I got my niggas in Queens, I got my bitches Uptown
I got my business in Manhattan, I ain't fuckin' around
I got some butter pecan Puerto Ricans from the Boogie Down
That's waiting on me to return
So they can snatch these braids out and put my shit in a perm. Word
They love it when I get to crippin'
And spitting this mag-ah-ni-ficent pimpin'

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You need to switch over and ride with a star
It'll get you far
I'm a P-I-M-P G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R
Yeah, I'm young, but I ain't dumb
Got some tricks, but I ain't one
I'm a guerrilla for scrilla, I trip you, you try to run
I let em do as they please, as long as they get my cheese
Even if they gotta freeze, or if it's a hundred degrees
I keep em on their knees, take a look under my sleeve
I ain't gotta give em much, they're happy with Mickey D's, PIMP

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
We keep it pimpin' in the South, you know how it go (dirty!)
We drive old-school, white walls with mink floors
I spin the G-Unit piece, and get em' dizzy
Handcuff her if you love her or you're girl coming with me
When your neck and wrist glow, she already should know
That money make the world go round, so lets get mo'
It's time to show these playas how it should be done
You got pimp potential, you might/could be one, G-UNIT!

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
In Hollywood, they say "there's no business like show business
In the hood, they say, "there's no business like ho business"
They say I talk a lil' fast, but if you listen a lil' faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch!

[Verse 1]
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?
My watch saying hi shorty we can be friends
My whip saying quit playing bitch get in
My earring saying we can hit the mall together
Shorty, it's only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things, y'all niggas, y'all know my style
Your wrist "bling bling", my shit "bling blaow"
My pinky ring talk, it say "Fifty, I'm sick"
That's why these niggas is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits
Flex my man he gon' bump my shit
See I'm a liar, man, I really don't care
I tell them hoes whatever they wanna hear
You tryna play me, Imma blaze ya then
My cross cost more than the crib ya mamma raised ya in

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 2]
New York niggas copy niggas like it's all good
Fuck around ,we crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama
I'm from NY whoady, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, niggas go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, roll out, I'm done
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump
Don't make me hit ya up, these shells will split ya up
I lay you down, the coroners will come and get ya up
See 50 play for keeps and 50 stay with heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real gutta, man; the hood love me, man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bruh man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
CO screaming "Shut the fuck up!" in the bing

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 3]
I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe or Vette, I tear up the highway
Shorty'll tell ya I'm 'bout my dick-game
But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed
These young boys, they done got they own work, man

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same time, yeah

[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah, where I'm from death is always in the air, homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creeping through the hood wearing Teflon
Hit the corners, motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with mac rounds
Ask Prim', nigga, 50 don't back down
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'mma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeh

[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 3: Akon]
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen the mac aiming at your head, mane?
Before you know it life is flashing, reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead, mane
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that
Don't go there, you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so

[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

Lil' Mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!

[Verse 1]
Go, go, go, 50 in the house
Bounce, y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums nigga
I ain't stupid, I say Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves it so erotic
Girl watch, I'm like bounce that ass girl
I get it crunk in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here we'll thump in here ohh!!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club wit the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh!

[Hook]
Lil' Mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!

[Bridge]
Let's party! Everybody stand up
Everybody put your hands up
Let's party! Everybody bounce wit me
Sip champagne and burn a little greenery

[Verse 2]
It's hot! Disco inferno!
Let's go! You're now rocking wit a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fa sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance, all I do it this
It's the same two step wit a lil twist
Listen punk I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' wit a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we fittin' to carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon be up in this bitch till we break daylight

[Hook]
Lil' Mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!

You see me shining, lit up wit diamonds
Cause I stay grindin, uh huh!
Homie you can catch me swooping
Bentley coupin' switching lanes, haha!
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah!
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit!
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay let's go

[Hook]
Lil' Mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!



[Eminem]
Gee wilikers Gatman, they got me surrounded

[50 Cent]
I'm on my way

[Refrain: 50 Cent]
I got a gat, man, if there's a problem I'mma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a Mac, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
They saying Batman, Robin, Cagney and Lacey
It's 50 Cent and Shady, the worst, baby
You put your hands on my peoples I'll react crazy
Put a hole through your front and your back, maybe
But go 'head, you try me
I'll have your ass hooked up to an I.V
I leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I react like an animal and tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art
Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
Hammer cocked back, hollow tip in the chamber, danger
Anger'll change ya, and make you aim and squeeze

[Hook: 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat, man
If there's a problem I'mma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big ass revolver
And a bat, man
Motherfucker, you retarded?
You touch 50 I'll leave you dearly departed

[Verse 2: Eminem]
We're walking away from a beef in which clearly you started
I said we're walking away, did you hear me?
You oughta be thankful that we ain't beefin
We'll disagree and just leave it at (that!)
'Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that (bat!) mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rap it's gonna be, brrat
Retaliation, it'll be like them Muslim Shiia, attacks
Somewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a (pact!)
He's got my back, I got his back (back!)
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
'Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit
Like we're conjoined at the hip, it's just unavoidable
Some of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over
Some of it will just simmer at best if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sitdowns
With no Daves and 'Zinos, there will be no peace discussions with me
There ain't gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fucking with me and I'll gladly quit fucking with you
Just spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentioning me, or the machine of Jimmy Iovine or Dre or 50
Or D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be
Or we'll be (knock knock) with a

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Nigga you get it twisted, you gon' get your wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hussle, I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie, I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, you plot it, you can count me in I'm with it
You cross me you gon' make a cemetary visit
That's gangsta, you know me I talk because I live it
Shell cases drop, when that choppa chop, way up the block
Get hit with copper tops, when the drama pop, hell I'mma pop
And it won't stop, you can run call the cops
This ain't new, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you, I want it
It's not a game; perfect aim; you feel the flame up against your brain
Man it's so hot I make you wish it'd rain

I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Some say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First Z got murked then Roy got murked
And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?
I smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood they identify niggas by their cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I'll send Yayo to dump 30 shots on your block
You should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done
I'll make you wet niggas if you 'round me son

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I come through the hood I don't stop to rap to niggas
Get close enough to smack then I'll clap ya nigga
Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with Mac's to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call: "Fifty what up?"
"They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up"
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo'
The shells from Twin's fo'-fo' blew the hinge off her door
Without that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?
Man, social service finna come and take them kids

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you a case act
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens
But when we come home that don't mean we going to fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear them whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood niggas running 'round acting crazy
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his and it might be yours
Because them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers
You can have them on their back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit
Because I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit

Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch

Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it

When time pass and I'm not around, niggas saying I'm out of town
Probably moving them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing
My closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit
Sell the shit you get high with, these niggas on my dick
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing
That's your bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram
I'm just from the past, I done been all in that ass
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Don't be worry 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug
Don't be worry 'bout my bitch pimping, she get money out that club
Don't be worry 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eating
You talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch, you must be tweaking
Don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about
Keeping it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'mma air it out
Why you worry 'bout my money, nigga? Bitch, you think I'm broke?
The Fed worry 'bout what I'm doing, think I'm selling dope
I may be and I may not, go to jail I may rot
I ain't never gon' snitch, nigga, never been no bitch nigga
I got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggas got question marks
Talking down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout what they talking 'bout
Don't tell me what that bitch done said
I'm done with her, you can go with her
I'm leaving here with another bitch
Don't worry 'bout how they look at me
My diamonds on, damn, look at me
These pussy nigga be shooked at me
Wanna judge and throw the book at me
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Had time to talk to my legal team
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Ain't shit they could do to me
Still rocking, still rolling
We holding, bill folding, you know it
When I start to ball out money start to fall out
Throw it up, it fall out the sky
Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
That's what I call my lifestyle

G-Unit, UTP
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
G-Unit, UTP, G-Unit, UTP
G-Unit, UTP, 50 Cent
Get 'em Buck, man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
50 Cent, that's my name, man I ain't fucking playing
I move on you with that Mac, mane
Come off that watch and chain 'fore I blow out your brains
Shells hit your chest, go out your back, mane
See me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long
Then niggas get laid out
Niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringing them thangs out
Then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
Dumping clips off at their whole clique, mane
When witnesses around they know how we get down
So when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane
My soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that
I'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit that's the gang
Come through here stunting you get popped at

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I came in this game knowing niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
Your niggas can't run cause I'm behind ya
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line, bro
Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire, bro
Right now we smacking 'em with platinum
And they hate it cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for
I represent it cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished
Juvenile, they can't stop us and I admit it I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfucking chopper

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
My twenty-inches spinning, you always see me grinning
And you hear niggas call me grimy
They hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me
When I come back around, man, I'mma back 'em down
I run up busting that TEC, mane
If you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run
My advice is you hit the deck, mane
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane
Cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
And we'll come checking through your set, mane
Man, you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't paying no fucking debt, mane
Cause you's a middle man, what don't you understand?
You's a fucking fake ass connect, mane

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

Nigga every law and every rule I break

Everyday I get birthday cake
There's a hundred racks there in that safe
Hundred grams there on that plate
I ain't thinkin' 'bout catchin' no case
Nigga my safe house super safe
I zip Giuseppe's, I don't tie no lace
Tom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga, run and tell, I'm fly as hell
Big Bentley, Mulsanne, no LP, just two songs
A-side, B-side, Ryder gang, bitch, that's right
From N.O. to N.Y, I got shooters bitch, don't act cute and shit
We was born broke, no silver spoon
My niggas strapped, they super goons
These niggas here kinda soft
We get the bread, then fuck it off
Get more money, then fuck it off
Make your bitch wan' suck me off
We ain't had shit, we learned to ball
Them ghetto bitches they love us all

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shorty bounce it and she clap that
Slide down the pole, she's a super ho

You niggas know how this 'sposed to go
I'm in the club with niggas, I clap that
That P90 I pack that
Your fuckin' head, I crack that
You wan' test me? Don't test me
Look, lover boy what're you trippin' for?
Niggas don't even want your ho
My nigga Ill fresh out the pen
You gonna make him go back again
Them bottles coming, we turnt up
Them sparks burnin' now watch us shine
You do this shit once a year
We do this shit all the time
Now captain come and save her
Get her from around this paper
She'll never be the same
I mean like everything will change
She cute blow a little cheese on her
Get her ass shots, throw D's on her
Them shoes more than you think though
My bitch look like my bank roll

I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

[Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rip it quick
And kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get
With them hoods, fatigues; with the boots with trees
Smoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga

[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya'
Get mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., because fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand
Even my P.O., she called me "the Ginger Bread Man"
I catch a new case, and tell her ass: "Catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up, to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper
There's no place like home, New York! New York!
I run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly
Or sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!

Passion, you laughin', I make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shawty, and that's what I'mma get to ya
Yo, I need you to be what I need more than liquor and weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me a reason to breathe
I need you, I'm telling you this so you know what I need
I'll be your part time or full time lover, significant other

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

Can I be your best friend if you promise you'll be mine?
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
They say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now, girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
First we get the talkin, then we get the touchin'
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin'
I kiss like the french then put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just means a different position
In the tub or on the sink, I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love (Ha Ha)

[Verse 2: Olivia]
You said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me
That's why I'm here standin' by your side cause you always come through for me
So many others tried to be where you are but they just wanted to do me
Glad you took your time and now I'm satisfied that's why I want you all to me

[Hook: Olivia]
Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time

Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate, come on

[Verse 4: Olivia]
I'm not afraid to explore my body - oooh, gimme that feelin
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD; baby that sexual healin'
You tried to sing to me; you're never on the key, but you do it just to appease me
I rather spend my time wastin' time with you; oooh wee you make it so easy

[Hook: Olivia]
Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round all the time)
Can I be your best friend, I promise boy you will be mine

I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Nowadays niggas snitchin' so much in the street
That you gotta talk to them like they the police
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
I don't know nothin 'bout settlin no beef in the streets
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
I ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, x, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass

[Hook: Prodigy]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentiary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When the album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin

[Chorus: Spider Loc
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a female holmes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones
We on the internet tryin to get our Email on

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you

I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through
To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise
Oops my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street
I don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep

[Hook: Mase]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 5: Mase]
I don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
There's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto
I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggas wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why them Harlem CB4 niggas just keep comin at me
Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
Could you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do



[Verse 1]
I'm a straight guerilla with it, cold hearted killa with it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it
I make it hot, mothafuckas freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, 32 shot clip in my snorkel
I might smile and say what's up but I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas
I'm on the edge, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap, what you lookin' at pussy
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'mma let her get in
I don't play but I'm a playa 'til the mothafuckin' end

[Hook]
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes
And when I open that do', bitch, get in my car

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you don't know that, uhh, I'm the shit
Now you better watch ya girl mane, I leave with ya bitch
I ain't stuntin' these hoes, man I'm bout my paper
If your bitch really 'bout it, nigga I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her make up
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icey
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey
Spent a life savings in a day, cause she likes me
Committment for me, uhh, nah not likely
Went out Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin'
But then the next week, nah, man it was nothin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie
They blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high
First it's pain when you lust for love, then it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needles in your arm
It's a cold world baby girl, lovin' me is not enough
Find out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus
Man you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me
They suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me
Hundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouths full baby, huh?
My conversation's so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawnin', turnin' over and I'm in the bed

Nigga, (yeah), nigga, you know I don't fuck with them niggas. Them niggas pussy. Sucka ass niggas. I don't like either one (I don't even like 'em). But the other night I'm in the gambling spot. Nigga come up in here - boom - hit the door. "Get the fuck on the floor, bitch, get down on the floor." I turn around like, "what?" Niggas like, "get down!" (When was this?) I'm like, "nigga, I got on white linen."

[Intro]
Fuck it, I mean we gotta kill what we eat, right? It's not a problem, it's really not a problem. Southside

[Verse 1]
Okay, the dope addin' up, the coke addin' up
The smoke addin' up, my pockets are fattened up
I got bitches in my bedroom, nerds on computers
Diamonds 'round my neck, straps for my shooters
I made it, look ma', I made it
I grind so hard to get here I can't be faded
I got lawyers on the line, five different kinds
Five different crimes, same .45
Got a plan to turn to premise, see, a nigga ain't lyin'
Cause they ain't gon' say I did it and I ain't gon' say I did it
And I might go back and forth to court, better bet I get acquitted
Can you dig it? Nigga, can you dig it?
Shit changed, a nigga ain't broke
I had a safe size as a shoe box, it felt like a vault
Now I got real money, that "fuck how you feel" money
That "nigga, you look at me wrong, get killed" money

[Hook]
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
Hop out, hammer out to get at you
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
.45 lettin' off some shit at you
You gon' be put in a body bag
You won't get a chance to fire back

[Verse 2]
I peep my swag in the mirror, I think I got a crush on me
I don't want no wack bitches touchin' me
Tailor-made threads, satin sheets on my bed
Get a bitch sea-sick, waves all on my head
Diamonds in my ear, Baccarat chandelier
Gabbana underwear, I'm so fly it ain't fair
Every day a different dime piece
Rose Gold, a different time piece
Hublot, AP or rollie
Your bitch and your jeweler know me, homie
I'm bulletproof, go 'head, take a shot at me
You be a dead nigga like the last one that got at me
My shirt level three so I ain't got a vest on
My heart like ice, my chest like teflon
I'm a nightmare right here, just me and my knife, nigga
Don't let me find out you ain't 'bout that life, nigga
It's doomsday, I mean goon day
I get the orders, like, "air out the room, Dre"
[Gun shots]

[Hook]
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
Hop out, hammer out to get at you
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
.45 lettin' off some shit at you
You gon' be put in a body bag
You won't get a chance to fire back

[Verse 3]
The mollies had a shorty ass trippin' strippin' in my kitchen
Push my thumb in her ass while I was strokin' her kitten
I be in my own zone, still clutchin' the chrome
Talk state of the art, you will see 'nine to foe
My passport need pages, I'm fuckin' round' out in London
Jetlag from jets, wrist lit baguettes
Trippin' in my charm, look bitch, I'm a don
So shit go how I say it go, fuck if I'm right or wrong
My paper long, bomb kush in the bong
It feels like I'm dreamin' cause a nigga on
I'm so far from a hammy down, I'm out in Miami now
My bitch no  speak no ingles, she fresh off the boat
She give me neck, what you expect? I got connects for the dope
I'm no joke, blow 30k on the coke, stuff ten in the coat
Nigga, front, I'll have a hand full of dreadlocks
Bitch, I hit your ass with a headshot

[Hook]
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
Hop out, hammer out to get at you
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
.45 lettin' off some shit at you
You gon' be put in a body bag
You won't get a chance to fire back



[Verse 1]
Niggas screw they face up at me
On some real shit son they don't want beef
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain't a shell left in my heat
Y'all niggas better lay down, yeah, I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain't gon' make it
You niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
I'm from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you're on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I wanna fuck
Gimme a second I'mma holla, I'mma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

[Hook]
In my hood - niggas got love for me
But I don't go nowhere without my strap
In my hood - a little 'dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don't know how to act
In my hood - niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood - niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood

[Verse 2]
I don't trust a muh'fuckin soul
When the D's come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I'm from it ain't safe to have more than a eighth
Niggas'll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo' case
Co-operate, or Doc'll have to operate
Niggas I'll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggas'll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas are lurking, you'll have to catch 'em and merk 'em
I'm observing in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I'm a hustler, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to eat when it's hot?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that's what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggas where I'm from don't wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain't good to do good in my hood
{*click-clack, BLAM*} You know not to do good now

[Hook]

[Intro]
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
I know you like style
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
Wanna get rich I'll show you how

[Verse 1]
On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn Yayo into dough
The original don dada, nobody bomb harder
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats they say "He so crazy"
The snitches they say "He tried to spray me"
That's what you get for trying to play me
The aftermath and my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try you can't stop it
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coupé cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
[Yayo] "50 you need some help?"
Chill, Yayo I got this
Where I'm from the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers
Man, I ain't give them little niggas no product

[Hook]
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how

[Bridge]
The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like "baby girl, I like them curves"
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'mma bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard

[Verse 2]
From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be trying to G us
Trying to holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging
We family, baby, kissing cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'till the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, ok, go to ya husband

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Em said you gone like my style
Dre said you gone like my style
I said you gone like my style
You gone like how I break it down

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You're not really, really ready
The drama will have ya ass in trauma, boy
You're not really, really ready
My knife flip open and then I gets to poking
You're not really, really ready
Them shells start popping and bodies get to dropping
You're not really, really ready
You think ya ready, ya not
Really really ready



[Hook: 50 Cent]
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'mma use it - yeah

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, yeah
Shoutout to Reverand Floyd Flake
It ain't my fault, Creflo Dollar, TD Jakes
Bishop Eddie L. Long. Easy-L shorty. Ha ha
Wooo! Feels good
Oh yeah, can't forget Bishop Morton
Cause my mama'll kill me, ha ha

[Verse 1]
Rule number one: Don't go against the grain
Rule number two: Give respect where respect due
Rule number three: If you get knocked, play games and say names
The 45 will tear you out the frame
It's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fucking thing
For me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money brings
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got plenty money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin' chopped on chow lines
An old timer schooled me, said: "Don't burn bridges, my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim"
I watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York
Me and shorty stood from a far and had a talk
He said "I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin' he had a lot of nerve"

[Hook]
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler

[Verse 2]
Yo when the Feds come in the game, loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin' feminine
With the Feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke, you get ten, you'll damn near do nine
I hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya' cheese
Try to see three hundred G's before you see 300Z's
Tree top to feel the breeze, coke connect for key's
Yo' bitches sexin' me, take me to ecstacy
Once I nut, I don't want 'em next to me
If it's on, mother fucker, believe I'mma ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood before I swallow my pride
Letters on my sweater read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin' with me from BKNY

[Hook]
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler

[Verse 3]
They say I don't sound like a killer, well how a killer sound?
I bet I grab a 4-pound and back that ass down
See many men live, baby, and many men die
Many men get drunk, puff lye and stay high
Here's a jewel: love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same, friends always change
I learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat
You can get 'em in the face, dog, or down his back
All bullshit aside now, its time to be honest
I fear no man, for death is all that's promised
I got niggas standin' in line waitin' to hear me spit
From '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Ain't nothin' changed in the game, but faces and names
The state, the weight, the date and the jake

[Hook]
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler

[Intro]
Boy you forgot my style

[Verse 1]
Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think ''nigga better you than me''
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, and niggas won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talking like she his main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing

[Outro x2]
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name
It's 50

[Intro]
D-D-Do you, do-do, do you think about me?
"Do you, do you, do you think about me?
Do you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you think about me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about fronting
Think about stunting when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet ski's slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racing through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine
Come on, let's ride

[Hook: Governor]
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, every now and then
(Do you think about me?)
Goddamn girl, we used to be friends
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment
She thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?"
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Governor]
Do you think about me? (Do you think about me?)
I know you think about me
You got to remember all the good times we had
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
I remember when you told me
(I know you think about me)
That I'll always be special to you, darling
You were so special to me, do you think about me?



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ha ha ha! I told niggas not to shoot dice with me
Look at this stack, I got money, I got money!
Ha ha ha..

Aw nigga don't trip, I'll kill you if you fuck with my grip
I won't hesitate to let off a clip
Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick, wet up your whip
Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' get your monkey-ass hit
Runnin your lip, tryin to fuck with my clique
Aw nigga don't trip, in case you didn't know who this is
It's 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit
Aw nigga don't trip

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I come through your hood, stunting in my yellow Lam'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruising, bumping Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinking the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a little house shopping, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But Becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearing fake shines, I'm rocking a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm

[Hook: 50 Cent]
And if you hustle, for me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need, them trees that hard that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggas know my steez, they don't fuck with me son
You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybachs
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playing
I'm up early with the birds, word, putting that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirping, I'm making moves
I got a hundred mil from music, a hundred grand from crack
Gonna see my jeweler so I can blow a stack

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath

[Verse 1]
Ha ha...
Sick with it, boy better get with it, what?
In the club I get it goin, goin, uh
Just movin to the music it's on
And the sounds of 50 and D-R-E
Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right aight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do, hit the dancefloor
And move how you wanna move, later on
We can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want
The fact is I got more than I flaunt, yeah

[Hook: 50 Cent]

Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor jampacked, look

Nigga I said set it off!

System thumpin', dancefloor jumpin'
We 30 deep in this bitch, we stuntin'
That's what you get, you in my hood
I thought you understood - you know me
V.I.P., no ID
Bottles of DP, I do it real B-I-G
Bitches break their neck to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy
I'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drums and the notes
Can you feel it? Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin with the realest

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor jampacked, look

Set it off on yo' left, dog
Set it off on yo' right, dog

Nigga I said set it off!

[50 Cent]
I'm hot boy, I'm burnin up
I do my thang in the club with the burner tucked
'Til the speakers all blown, we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah do that mayne
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
Get to poppin and shakin that thing on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move
But I ain't payin for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I stay with it
Hit the telly play with it in a major way get it

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor jampacked, look

Nigga I said set it off!



[Intro-50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm trying to catch me something
A little jux or somethin

[Hook-50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse 1-50 Cent]
You wanna spray at me go ahead; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new sig and that old 38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching Dre serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek with marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2-50 Cent]
Who's that peeping in my window - WOW, the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming fuck Jake
I'm trying to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at AI peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on the spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low key



[Hook: scratching]
[Pain In Da Ass] "Fuck You" [3x]
[Styles] "I don't give a fuck" [3x]
[Styles] "I don't give a fuck who you are"
[Pain In The Ass] " Fuck You"
[Nas] "Niggas is this and that"
[Big Pun] "I'm even, even better than before"
[Styles] "I don't give a fuck who you are"
[Pain In Da Ass] "Fuck you"
[Nas] "Niggas is this and that, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just the best"

[Verse 50 Cent]
Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy
Or I could feel the world turnin'
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'
Comin' up, I was taught never back down
That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie
Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
There's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggas know, ain't nothing sweet about me
They keep asking me questions, like "50, who shot ya?...
You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah, Tah?"
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
So, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know
A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
LET'S GO!

[Hook (Different Variations)]

[Verse 50 Cent]
Maaaaaaaaan
I told niggas not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics
Since 90, when Nas came out with "Illmatic"
If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Mattola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, son I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggas take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggas ain't gotta like me
My own homie said "50, you done lost yo' mind"
Cause I shootout in a broad day, run and toss my nine

[Hook (Different Variations)]

[Verse 50 Cent]
Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say "50 ain't hot"
When I drop, I'm sell like Eminem and Kid Rock
Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
Jux me, A week later y'all be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This ain't how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks
Have niggas runnin' like "Jesus Comin'"
There's wet pillows in prison, niggas cry in the dark
Cause if they did in the day, niggas would question they heart
So when they come home, the come home
Walking that tough walk, talking that "Rikers Island Bing Talk"
Talk'll get you shot in New York - BBBBLLLLATTTTT
Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I ain't tryin' to do hard time like Pistol Pete

See, niggas uptown understand me in the street
You niggas uptown'll "Stan" me in the street
Ha-ha



[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
So what you sayin', boy? You a shooter, boy? Nigga, we don't care who you shot
Nigga, quit talking money 'round rich niggas, nigga, we don't care what you got
Bitch, I got six niggas that hit niggas, boy, I don't give a fuck
Especially when I'm lit, nigga, real shit, nigga, send a bitch to line you up
Boy, I don't chit-chat when I click clack, I might ask a nigga, "What's up?"
Pull off in an Aston, pull up in a hooptie, then you fuck-niggas getting fucked
Talking 'bout rapid-fire, automatic, brrrrrt, bang
Nigga, hit everybody, I said everybody, laying right there where they stand, nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, you ain't sprayin' nothing, you ain't laying nothing
Nigga, you ain't saying nothing, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
'Til you do something, niggas out here putting that work in
And I'm cool, nigga, like that cup I put my purp in
You ain't 'bout the strap, you ain't 'bout that knife, you ain't 'bout that life
You ain't 'bout that, that gangsta shit, you ain't 'bout that
When it's on we'll have you broad day or night, you ain't 'bout that, right?
You ain't 'bout that life, that gangsta shit, we 'bout that

Got a maniac mind-state, will increase the crime rate
Me and every nigga on my team got a bathroom, bitch, try me
You ain't sayin' nothin', that's Twitter talk, I'm from where real niggas walk
Crackers tried to lynch me, but couldn't get me cause I'm real smart
Heart of a lion, what that mean? I got a big heart
Certified in style, been like that since a lil' boy
Nigga, who you talking to? You know what I'll do to you
Transvestite your bitch-ass, make you work out in a hula hoop
Street king, Boosie, boo, did things that turn you Christian
Let it burn, fuck the consequences, what you saying? I'll burn you
Bitches to the ground with no mercy, I promise you
From Baton Rouge to Cashville, niggas gon' ride for Boos'
So what you saying? Yeah, don't tell me, you don't wan' see my mind twisted
Oh, you pussy talking like these bitches, when I see you that's your issue, nigga

Thick bitch, watch when she stand up, she just bounce, nigga, nigga, nigga
I'm brick money, my nigga nigga, you an ounce, you ain't shit, money
I'm rent money, I get money, a bitch better get what she can get from me
Got tats all on my body, my paperwork coming back clean
Me and Boosie just tryna help B.G. get through his fourteen
I don't want liquor, I just want lean, I caught two bodies on four beams
I gotta slow down (fuck that shit, we home now), well nigga, nigga, nigga
It's going down, point 'em out and I'mma point blank it, point blank
I will have you emptying everything you have in your bank
Bitch, I ain't get no visits, I just done my time, ho
Bought your bitch so many bottles turned into a wino
Stomp a nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga ass out in these Giuseppe's
All my bitches on par, all my niggas got felonies
Don't do that, you ain't 'bout that, you don't sell that, you don't count that
You might grew up being around that, you weren't there where we was gettin' down at
Lil' nigga (lil' nigga, lil' nigga, lil' nigga)

[Produced by Detroit Red & DJ Don Cannon]

[Verse 1]
D's trying to pin a murder on me
In the precinct they saying I done murdered homie
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homie
And everybody know my niggas murder for me
You see homo on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They finna to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the sticking when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm getting sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksucking police got it in for me
They flash their lights, they wanna rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new Bebo's, who gon' be Eddie Byrne?
Huh, we'll find out when niggas let off the rounds
And his partner's screaming officer down

[Hook]
Police get in the way, I'll murder them
I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder them
I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder them
I'll murder them
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder them
You see I told you I'd murder them

[Verse 2]
They saying I'm an accident waiting to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waiting to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies from selling that crack shit
And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
Cause your baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back, and cruise

Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Sooner as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas could tell
A East coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists, write about me leave me confused
Have me feelin like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic - sheeit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move

[Hook - repeat 2X]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it - c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music - let's go, let's go

[50 Cent]
Last year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good
On the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood
Had yo' favorite actress, from yo' favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
And my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit, this is "When Doves Cry"
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homey this is somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women but some niggas is bitch made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen? Your fuckin brain's on drugs
Look ice drippin on my neck, hands grippin on a tec
Fool trippin threw a set, you can get yo' ass wet
Cards messin up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid yo' ass better come correct

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
My momma gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins (uh-huh) I'm still thuggin
Cruisin, rims gleamin like the stones on my wrist
Zonin, guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homey, you hustlin backwards if you chasin a bitch
Stupid - chase the paper they come with the shit
I'm fallin, in love with success
Entrepeneur, conniseur, I maneuver the best
Rollin, Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner have your homies burnin rest in peace candles
As wise men speak I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns
Rappers I make 'em sick, when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In 99 I had a vision and made a decision
Bein broke is against my religion, now I'm caked up - what?

[Hook] - to fade



[Hook: 50 Cent]
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm still a baller, I'm still balling
That's five times I ain't picked up, your bitch still calling
I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit
Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick
We still mob, niggas steal stuff
We still deal after deal, shit is no problem
He still love her, she ain't shit
Get her a pair of Louboutins, she suck a dick
Still real niggas, still will kill
Told the still bitch don't squeal, get your cap peeled
The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips
Copper-tops, get your ass popped, watch a body drop

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
I'm clean as a motherfucker, still getting my hands dirty
Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you looking thirsty
See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers
I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker
Mask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, long ranger
Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing
Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga
Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame
You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper
Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper
I'm gone

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
She on my leg like a little kid
She hump my leg like a horny pit
Pitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet
Now I ain't running after no broads, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green
She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why
Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look
There ain't a bitch more dime than me
The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me
While you

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making

[Verse 4: Styles P]
Ghetto niggas still'll pick a penny up
You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up
Little homie loading a semi up
Catch him all after the club, tell him to ante up
Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way
You owe me, you better pay
Ghost, let the beretta spray
Hood want uncut dope and some better yay
I ain't chasing pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still robbing, still rolling, still need a mask
Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making

Here’s a little info you should know
You don't know what you're in for

[Hook: Mr.Probz]
Get the party rockin’, bottles poppin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
System thumpin’, the club is jumpin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Let’s toast to success and take it a little higher
May tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires
Let your driving ambition offer you new visions
May your gut-instinct help you make good decisions
This is more than Champagne, this is more than just a glass
This is a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever had
Let’s enjoy tonight like tonight’s our last
We can focus on the future and reflect on the past
We done came so far, I mean, look where we are
If they don’t call us by name they call us entrepreneurs
From the block to the board room, the hood to the high life
Skyscraper paper, baby, life in the limelight
Want the best of the best, the top of the top
I mean the baddest bitch, you know, the cream of the crop
We gotta hustle and have it, we better than average
More like the elite, my nigga, we gotta eat

[Hook: Mr.Probz]
Get the party rockin’, bottles poppin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
System thumpin’, the club is jumpin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
What was once a strike against us has become an advantage
Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts
That mastermind, the mental is oh so essential
Product of the environment, they ain't been what we've been through
I’m fond of the phrase “If there’s a will, there’s a way”
‘Cause we come from the parts where only killas could play
Southside, it’s alright, ghetto’s my Alma Mater huh? It’s alright
We could keep the party jumpin’ like this all night
The bottles, just keep ‘em coming, baby, let’s get right
Let’s get it on, play a little Marvin
It’s gettin’ hot in here, homie, this could be a problem
Keni Burke style, let’s keep rising to the top
Let’s do it, do it big and let the fuckin’ haters watch, oh yeah
This is perfect, this a moment to remember
As we proceed on our money getting agenda

[Hook: Mr.Probz]
Get the party rockin’, bottles poppin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
System thumpin’, the club is jumpin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, they tryna buy some Gucci, I'm tryna buy the mall

Young turbo, six speed 9/11

[Non-stop]
(Yo, check me out right here yo)

Yo
Yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan, then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and Berettas
Yeah faggot, if I want it, I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me, or I got to grab it
Don't make a ass out of yourself trying to stop me
I'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, eight levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga
Ugly nigga, I'm the wrong one to provoke
You ratting on niggas is only going to leave you smoked
So the only thing left now, is toasts for these cowards
I got no friends; fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit; 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars; they lay around flowers

[50 Bars of Pleasure by Lloyd Banks]
I got a industry gangstress, that argues, and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch, like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm sliding through the raucous, with Prada on the chuckers
So the spring break hoes home from college want to fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I sic Rottweilers on you fuckers
Cops following to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros
When it come to paper, I blow the soul out a hero
I'mma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides
Every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen
Changing the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy
I know the watch bothering your vision
But reach, and I put a dot on your head
Like it's part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten
Because Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison
I'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
But it ain't a problem getting dressed
Because my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run when we starting a raid
Or leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs
I'm a young pimp, pardon my age
I don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids
Niggas find out what club they at, take them with us
And run trains on them, like a subway map
Your advance is a grey Acura
See these record labels got most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
I'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
Keep your ammo clean, Tech's polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hampers that monitor the floor
By now, you probably heard of me
Fresh out of surgery, flashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy, white T: burgundy
You match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I tote, C-notes from different years
Bezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
You're better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive
You ain't gettin' nuttin', but you french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere
You going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life
And your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you
Something positive, alright:
Well, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;
You ain't going nowhere
Get yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}
Fucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}



[50 Cent talking]
This mic on?
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank you for coming out tonight for the screening of my new film
"I'm Not Rich I'm Still Lyin'"
It's 50 Cent starring as Game, it's autobiographical
I hope you enjoy yourselves

[Verse 1: 50 impersonating Game's voice]
50 callin me crazy
I might be just maybe
I'm gangsta I'm crippin'
The Damu I'm trippin'
Fuck 50, fuck Dre, fuck N.W.A
Man I'm Hurricane Game (Em this nigga changed)
I brought the west back I write the best raps
(But what about Snoop?) Snoop shit ain't all that
And I get bad bitches now I even fucked Mya
(I fucked her 1st Game) 50 you a liar
See that's why I hate you, you think you know me
I'mma tell everybody you shot my homie
I hope the police get you and you go to jail
Feds freeze your accounts so you can't make bail
Hope everybody on G-Unit go to hell
Wit Eminem, Obie, Stat Quo and D-12
So what I was on change of hearts so what I was a stripper
So what I never banged I'm from Compton nigga

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Now horror films they scare me
I watch action films very rarely
When it's comedy or it's drama
It's starrin me no problem

[Verse 2]
Gggggg-Unot I got my own shoe (Game that shit ain't gon' sell)
So, the ad's in the magazine nobody can't tell
(Good luck wit yo next album man I hope it does well)
You tryna be funny, D-Mack got all my money
And Jimmy robbin me, they listenin probably
Me and Fase had a fall out he really not my brother
We got the same father but we got different mothers
Now Suge punked Dre but he don't punk me
I won a Vibe Award this year nobody punch me
(Game you know I wrote that hook for Hate it or Love it)
So what its still on my trophy case I think nothing of it

[Hook]

[Outro:50 talking in is normal voice]
Yeah; it's 50
New album, July 18th
It's called "I Can't Stay Away"
Y'all thought I was gonna let y'all eat?
Naw nigga

Oh! This is too much fun man
Hey... hey nigga I seen yo lil DVD nigga
Is that all you got? I mean newsflash: nobody believes you
Then you say you woke up outta coma 2001
Well yo brother says you never were in a coma
Then you say you were in a gang, Well yo brother says you were never in a gang
Now you can get your records together and you can submit 'em to me
I mean you can send the records you have to me so I can...open...

You gotta send your music to the boss.... that's me the boss
Yeah....it's D-Unit G-Unit that's it that's all
I rule wit a iron fist
Cocksucker

[Intro]
Don't make this complicated
My old school candy painted
I hustle hard
When I come through they like ''oh my God - that nigga clean''

[Hook]
From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz
And move it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes
But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby

[Verse 1]
I come through, I had the hoes like ''who he?''
Seats in the old school Louis
Shoes and the belt buckle Louis
We don't need more details now do we?
Let 'em sag, my swag is True Religion
You gonna need Cartier frames to see my vision
It smells like cream mixed with weed, this is classy and hood
Drama llama time, nigga, what's good?
Domino's, motherfucker, it's time to collect
Stack paper like I'm trying to fix the national debt
I'm just doing what I wanna do, I trip these set
This is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get on my level, bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with
We talk market and distribution and politics
Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the whole block
I sell the chip of a whole rock, 10 dollars a pop
I'm a magnet, the bitch can't help but watch me
Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace, Versace, Versace
Designer threads in every form of fashion
I express myself so the question I'm askin'
Is this flip or the next flip tailor 50 shit?
We ain't promised tomorrow, nigga, go on and get the shit
That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing
In case you ain't notice this a Queens thing

[Hook]

[Outro]
Oh, it's cold out here
It's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded
It's 50
When I come through you see me
In the Suburbans that's bulletproof, bomb proof, leather six, what else?
When I go hard I go hard
When I don't want you to see me I switch it up
I'm in that black on black Porsche Panamera
In the back like ''ooh wee''
We rolling
I hustle, man, it's what I do, man
Wait, niggas gon' try and tell me how to do this?



[Intro - 50 Cent]
Just one night, tonight
It could be three of us
Yeh yeh yeh
Girl, we could get it on
(Where ya' girlfriend)
Girl, we can have a ball
(Bring ya' girlfriend)
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love until the next day
We'll have the rest of our time to celebrate

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Four in the morning girl
Now I don't wanna talk
We've been talking for hours
Now you know I wanna fuck
Look I don't understand what it
Is you don't understand
My watch a hundred grand
My chain a hundred grand
Bitch, I'm a wanted man
I say I run New York
Cause I do what the fuck I wanna do
They know wussup
They say my screws are loose
I say who cares, you know I'm rich
Look I don't have time to blow with a bitch shooting the shit
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pulling down your skirt
When I get the stroking girl you don't know what to say
Quick come quick, girl, I'm gone right away
Yeh, you nasty, girl, you nasty
And I'm into that, so get at me!

[Hook - 50 Cent]
I don't want no good, good, good, good, girl
Me, I want a nasty girl
Come creep with me
Be a freak for me
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love until the next day
We'll have the rest of our time to celebrate

[Verse 2 - Too Short]
I said bitch
I wanna fuck you in the worst way
Hell yeah, I wanna fuck you on the first date
If I don't
I say, fuck you on Thursday
Cause then I won't want you
Watch how fast I dump you
But right now I'm infatuated
You get to hang with me
Girl, you graduated
I take you out for drinks and get you tipsy
Then I pull my dick out and I say kiss me
You're about to laugh ya little panties off
You only get one date
You better grab these balls
They wanna ride in fancy cars
That's what bitches do
They like to rub it then suck it and lick it too
She's a nasty little trap ho slut
But I like that shit, so let's fuck
Bitch!

[Hook - 50 Cent]

[Outro - 50 Cent (+ Too Short)]
Ohhh, ehhhh
It sounds crazy
But tomorrow's not promised
I mean, I mean I wanna do it today
I want it now
I don't wanna wait
Wait for what?
My time's running out
Your time's running out
Come here girl
(Wanna fuck you bitch
I wanna fuck you bitch
You only got
One date
Ain't no tomorrow)



Unh, all I do is this
Stunt when I want, ride new shit
Unh, all I do is this
Unh, niggas new to this

[Verse One]
I’m super-rich like Russell, naw Leor
I’m decked out, my bitch smell like Dior
She spoiled, she want it, she can have that
Your bitch cool, but where her Birkin bag at?
You can tell a lot about a nigga by his bitch
Be my guest, look at mine, I’m the shit
I’m hot, my shit bump coast to coast, don’t it?
I get bread my watch I blew a loaf on it
Get caught staring at that get smoked for it
Fool, my swag unlimited
So fly, ain’t shit I can’t buy
Louboutin kicks, my Louis Vuitton bitch
Fresh off the runway, get your one one-day
Catch me in Milan, tuxedo on
The black James Bond, nigga I’m a Don
I do what I want, when and where I want

[Hook]
Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see
What’s up, you know you wanna party with me
Let’s fuck, we wilding in the place to be
Bitch quit playing
Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see
What’s up, you know you wanna party with me
Let’s fuck, we wilding in the place to be
Nigga quit playing

[Verse Two]
Catch me riding solo, Purple Label Polo
Paparaz’ photo my side bitch in Manolo
It’s all about dough though, my knuckle game like Cotto
Plus I get to shooting, but keep that on the low though
(Hey!) Nigga, I don’t really got to talk about it
Me, I get paper, moves I make major
Shoes I rock – gator, wing tips player
My style so pure, I’m so couture
I’m down by law, certified B-boy
Hold up, wait a minute, money – I’m gonna spend it
Or why the fuck would I hustle hard to get it?
So many flows, the hoes be on the di-dick
And when they pop it and lock it, they know I’m with it
Dame lengua, give tongue while I hit it
She a star, fresh from PR
Give me more, baby give me more

[Hook]

[Hook x4]
I got that animal, animal ambition

[Verse 1]
Why give her love and affection, she just want some bread
I ain't talking or texting, I just want some head
She from a Piru set where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags, but I'm a gangster, bitch
I say ''say no to drugs'' then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips, I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it, nigga, eat a dick
I just call 'em when I want 'em, I don't need a bitch
You see me stunting with my diamonds on, everything proper
Your shit look chrome and your shit look copper
It's turning, homie, that's why you're turning on me
Admit it, I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public, I'm a cancer, man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe, niggas know who I am

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
You say you hustle like a hustle, I be moving the shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we counting the paper it better come back correct
Out in New Orleans, baby, niggas hungry for bread
Come throrugh that 9th ward stuntin' and get shot in your head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me, you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger, I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Yeah, I'm scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit, my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me, I'll be catching a case
New York a concrete jungle where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and you're dead, you'd be very afraid
I don't know how to behave, untamed fresh out the cage

[Hook x8]



[Verse 1]
Nigga, this is not a fictional tale, this shit real
We was sittin' in the Bookings? Charged, direct sale
Third shootout… we was fightin’ for positions
Shell casings out my 9 flyin’ through your mama kitchen
Paper we stack it, pistols we pack it
You fuck around, we’ll blow your heart out the back of your jacket
Bitch, get down or lay down, my work is at Chach' crib
‘Cause he got big, now he lieutenant so he sit there and watch
I swear to God I think I had the same vision that Cat had
Woke up sayin’ “we gon’ turn them corners to Baghdad”
Yeah, we was young, but we had guns, we started juxing niggas
All you hear is Boo-Boo fuckin’ with them Brooklyn niggas
I had supreme schemes, Corley Wall thoughts
Start shootin’, I bet I’ll clear off the ball court
I want it all, that’s just how I fuckin’ feel, boy
Get in the way, you gon' take your trip to Gilmores

[Hook]
I’m dreamin’ of…
My dream of freedom…
Financial freedom

[Verse 2]
Consist of big bags of bread and some coke, nigga
You can get with the program, fam’ll get smoked, nigga
We was a school of sharks - a bunch of young soldiers
Open your head when you’re half dead – you see? I told you
On the island, got that burner, got the flamethrower
A couple niggas got blown, I got my name known
Over the phones, soon as I’m home, the game’s sewn
I got connections – look, bitch, I’m connected
And I ain’t givin’ niggas no passes, so respect it
Or get dealt with, I’ll break you off proper
You ready to die, huh? Too much Big Poppa
Easy – nigga chill or get laid out
I’ll put a hole in you then find out what your gang ‘bout
I do my dirt, I’m hardly ever by my lonely
I got that tech with that cooling system on me
You think you want it, you don't want it with me homie

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We stackin’ paper ‘til we strong then we takin’ over
Grab a gat, bring the crack back with baking soda
Bridge the gap, get slapped, actin’ like you know us
North Pole, nah, Southside produce the colas
We’re the last of our litter, this is what they taught us
We’ve got to kill what we eat, that nigga came up on us
If you ain’t gamblin’, get the fuck out the spot, boy
Shoot an ace off your foot, that’s some shit you should get shot for
Fuck it, when I win I’m a winner – when I lose, I’m a winner
‘Cause to my niggas y’all niggas lookin’ like steak dinner
You screw your face the fuck up, you gon' do what?
The strap big enough in my truck to chew your crew up
Nigga stand down or get manned down
Mack, two clips, 30 rounds plus 30 rounds, flip it around
You gon’ fuck around and get jammed up, blammed up
Hit your spine, a standup nigga can’t even stand up

[Hook]



Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to 2Pac. People either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didn't like what he did. But whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.

My favorite 2Pac album is The Don Killuminati. It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper. That's something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space. Everybody knows that they're going to die. But after you're in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.

2Pac's aggressive records are my favorite. "Hail Mary" is just perfect: "Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted." Most artists now just aren't smart enough to write that, or honest enough to write a line like, "I ain't a killer but don't push me." These days rappers will just tell you, "I'll kill you."

2Pac was like a camera. It's incredible how much he wrote — how much he documented. To me, 'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper. You can always tell when you're hearing 2Pac verse. He wrote those lyrics without any music. Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven — I'm sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music — but 'Pac was just hashing out his life. The thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and that's when things got out of control.

All of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac. The music was all that mattered. That East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef. Now that he's not here, he's bigger than ever. I can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight. Sometimes I put on 2Pac's best songs, followed by Biggie's best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.

Laurence Fishburne told me once that he didn't like 2Pac. He told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didn't like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better. I understood what he meant. But I still gave him a look like he was bugging.



[Hook]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

[Verse 1]
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fucking crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money long
You try to touch me, I pull out, you get your brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on your own
You right there in my zone, welcome to the terrordome
The ice blowing my chain, blood blue in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doing my thang
The semi-auto spray, run if you get away
We'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead

[Hook]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

[Verse 2]
In the hood, hoopty, hat low, niggas don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress
Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once he keep fighting, fuck it just keep cutting 'em
It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get your cap peeled, nigga you know the drill
Brownsville, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food and the hand that feed 'em too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York
Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some Bloods, I'm cool with some Crips
I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em lover boy, we can share a bitch

[Hook]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

[Verse 3]
I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass wanna tussle
AR-15, cooling system makes the shell case muffled
Scope, infrared, run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killa, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggas new Macs and llamas
Got respect for human life, but will accommodate you
One phone call and niggas will exterminate you
No future fucking with me, there's no tomorrow
Niggas'll run up on you tonight and hit you with hollows

[Hook]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)



[Intro]
Yo, you know what I want? I want the beat to drop right now
Niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right? Yeah, you are crazy
I ain't crazy - you are crazy - atleast I don't think I'm crazy
I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot  you hot, but you crazy
Why they wanna? I don't know

[Verse 1]
It's the money that makes shit get ugly
It's the money that makes these hoes love me
It's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me
Man, I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do and see
The felonies from day to day make me say what I say
When I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's
Don't cry for me, smile for me
And if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me
Remember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed
And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
Let my tombstone read "I Tried" and from the start
Everything I wrote was from my heart
So it’s always gon' be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
Sometimes it sounds like I'm playing, but I'm sayin'
This shit is real, it ain't a game

[Hook]
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine


[Verse 2]
First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody, kid
So I get vest up when I get dressed up
In the hood it's messed up, niggas running 'round shooting shit up
If it's Dom that you drinking fill up my cup
If you gossiping about me shut the fuck up
Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
When getting robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
Duke listen, if you move I'mma hurt you
You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
Right now what you need to do is give me the cash
Forget about your boss being mad, just save ya ass
Be a good boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
Alright, run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you, but I really need this cash

[Hook]
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

[Verse 3]
I know we all gonna go, but I'd hate to go fast
Then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
Man listen, if you really really like this shit
Nigga, call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
Call him now before I drop for real cause after I drop
I'mma be chargin' ya'll niggas like forty a pop
To each his own: me? I'd get it while it was cheap
Typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killing to eat
Niggas'll treat you like a egg, when you come to cop you get beat
Give me your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? What a treat
You're a generous guy, take 'em off or die
Man, we hurting 'round here, ain't nobody slinging pies
Look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly
Why you 'round here with this shit anyway? Huh? You high?
See, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye

[Hook]
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine



[Intro]
Man I finna do my thang (get up!)
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there mayne (get up!)
Trust me homie I'm not playin' (get up!)
I have the dance floor off the chain, I said (get up!)
I came to bring you that California love
And a little New York hate, it's all of the above
I'm not playin', I said I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow instructions, I said (get up!)

[Verse 1]
I ball ‘til I fall, stunt 'til I drop
'Em off the showroom floor, not the used car lot
You buy a bottle, I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get into it, I get into it
Everybody can’t do it the way I do it
I make it rain, till the sun come out
A nigga playin', we make the guns come out
Now, my question is who they gon' blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I made the kids want slang
And N.W.A. made the West Coast bang
Nah, it's just music man, it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

[Hook]
I have the savoir-faire
I’m the reason, everybody, here, I said (get up!)
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin'? I really don't care, I said (get up!)
I wanna see, I, I wanna see ya move
And get all into the groove, I say (get up!)
I'm gettin' money man, I really don't care
Let me see you put your ass in the air, I said (get up!)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, lady, you look good, I wanna get to know you better
You look good in them jeans and them red stilettos
You got a Bentley Coupe booty baby, I wanna drive
See it'll tell you what your mileage is when I'm inside
I wanna take you for a spin, you know, round and round
Switch gears till' your love comes down
I take you to the point of no return if you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn, I got money to burn
While they can't get a place, she drop the bomb on me
It's up and down and up and down gracefully
Rick James would've said She a Brick House
But Fifty you should go home and see what that bitch bout
I find out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up, get ya some, I know how to get ya sprung
Tune ya up and use the tongue, under the hood is so good
She said it so good, goddamn I'm so hood, nigga what up?

[Hook]
I have the savoir-faire
I’m the reason, everybody, here, I said (get up!)
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin'? I really don't care, I said (get up!)
I wanna see, I, I wanna see ya move
And get all into the groove, I say (get up!)
I'm gettin' money man, I really don't care
Let me see you put your ass in the air, I said (get up!)

[Outro]
And get into it
You're now rockin' with the Unit, I say (get up!)
And get into it
We gon' show you just how we do it, I said (get up!)
Aftermath
Still Shady Aftermath, I said (get up!)
Aftermath
Still Shady Aftermath



[Snoop Dogg]
Shit ya did it again my nigga

We off and we runnin'
With Fifty and Snoop Dogg and the mackelineum
Keepin' it down playa
Pimps up, you know the rest

[Intro]
From the day you're born 'til the day you die
If you're one of the poor ones you just gotta work hard

[Hook]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Verse 1]
They putting pressure on me, son, now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smoking crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me
Forget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney
Man, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi
Who's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty
Why's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie
Man, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing
I guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
I'm on flight

[Hook]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven

I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Verse 2]
My baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
I'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me
Niggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you "my dad's fucking crazy"
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try
You get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye
I'm on flight

[Hook]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven

I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Verse 3]
My lawyers on retainers every month, I give ‘em stacks
In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
When dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck
So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up
I'm on flight

[Hook]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven

I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

I'm on it
Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around
It's never on safety
I'm on it
Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around it's goin' down
No if's or maybe's
Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's
Niggas gettin' cake made
Fuck with the homies while I got it on me
You'll get your big break, man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You niggas ain't seen shit yet, one false move and I click clack
That oo-wop bitch I spit that, that hard white I flip that
That bad bitch get my dick wet, damn how hot can my shit get?
Boy, get outta line get your ass checked, got 10 mil' my last check
Bitches stay where that cash at, diamonds on me I flash that
That 'Rari pedal I mash that, you pussy niggas I laugh at
That fuck shit that you fuck niggas be doin', man, I'm passed that
Hood nigga down there on Wall Street, my stock run across NASDAQ
Girl face on my time piece, ridin' around with my crimeys
These broke niggas so grimy, I let 'em hold the steel, I tell 'em shoot to kill
I put south side on my back, I ain't talkin' 'bout no tat'
When I'm outta town I hold it down, I mean everywhere I'm at

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I'm on it
Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around
It's never on safety
I'm on it

Niggas gettin' cake made

You'll get your big break, man

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
All my niggas crazy stupid, cuckoo, got a loose screw
I might pew pew with that two-two then small bullets will mob through you
My bitch come from Honolulu with that dope ball in her doo doo
Put it on a train and choo choo and the feds don't have a blues clues
Thumbing over, don't know voodoo but I sure know how to shoot you
If I get caught I don't boo-hoo, I pick up the phone call BooBoo
He gonna bail me out in seconds, please don't let this rap shit fool you
I send shooters to your home, see I don't need no songs to move you
My gorilla goin' ooh-ooh, boy your family could lose you
Put you in a box like new shoes, you's a bitch pull down your tu-tu
When it come to gettin' money all I know is we need bookoo's
Speakin' only in my Ryda Gang, know what we gonna do to you

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around
It's never on safety
I'm on it
Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around it's goin' down
No if's or maybe's
Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's
Niggas gettin' cake made

Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle (Fuck with the winners baby)
Put up your hands for me, baby (Put 'em up)
And do it like we're supposed to
Cause we're gonna win

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Consider this the theme song for victory
The shit you say to yourself when you make history
I'm trying to make it feel like the first time
Like a junkie I'm sort of chasing my first high
I'm focused, I'm disciplined, I'm ready
Mentally on point, sharp as a machete
Hard work, I work hard, I get the job done
There's only one number 1, nigga, I'm number 1
I'm confident, you can call it vain or conceited
Cars, clothes, I need it
Condos, condoms and bad bitches to be with
Run with a winner, baby
Be unconventional, freak me off with friends maybe
You can be my girl, be my fair weather friend
Or you could be my, yeah yeah, be my friend 'til the end

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
Cause we're gonna win

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I got that disease ambition, success is the cure
They wanna win, I gotta win, I sell the shit pure
I got dopeboy bonds, Einstein brains
The heart of a nigga homicidal on the chain gang
I want yachts and drops, I got spots to watch
I wanna see what life is like from the mountain top
Who says sky's the limit? I'm limitless, I just took the pill
Why you think a nigga slow flow so ill?
Be careful, the shit I got is highly contagious
We hustled 'til it had us all locked up in cages
Time gon' fly when niggas been bidding for ages
War stories and wounds, back and forth, a nigga been trading
For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan
We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making
I guess it's all risk versus rewards
A nigga risk it all for the broads
(What's up?)

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
Cause we're gonna win

Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
Cause we're gonna win



[Hook]
I get that dirt, you know that blow and baking soda be the recipe
Fasho I make that .40 Cali' blow, you get the best of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
I know for sure I'll split your mothafuckin’ head, you get to testin' me
You call the cops and I get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'

[Verse 1]
It's hard, yeah, it's hard, this that New York shit
That black glove, wood grip, outline 'em in chalk shit
I don't wanna talk, say a prayer for my enemies
Droptop, ten shots, I'll make your ass a memory
Time to ride, homicide, I'm down with it
I'll wave that chopper, hit your whip and shake the ground with it
Fuck with N dot Bonepart, get your ass blown apart
Hip hop's Napoleon, you know war, you know me then
I'll hunt you like a great dane
Hit you, hit you like a freight train
Run off with your fake chains
I'll give you mothafuckas somethin' to believe in
Knife work your lungs, I'll make it hard to breathe in
Little shit could be a big enough reason
You're dancin' with the wolves, fool, better feed them
I feel for you, you ain't ready for the outcome
Nigga I'll get at you all week with the same gun

[Hook]
I get that dirt, you know that blow and baking soda be the recipe
Fasho I make that .40 Cali' blow, you get the best of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end

You call the cops and I get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'

[Verse 2]
Me I punch every nigga first I had a fight with
Maybe it's genetics, mama made me like this
Cocaine baby, problem child, half crazy
Children of the Corn, I've been warned so long
Big strap for robberies with my little 380
I'll make your little lady miscarry a baby
You leave the scene unseen when I get to trippin'
Pistol whip your head hard enough to blur your vision
What up, comrade, salute, I pull rank, I got bank
Just fucked up work, askin' if we'll use shanks
Every clique I'm in my clique, nigga, I run shit
I put in my own work, run, get who you gon' get
This is how it feels when you squeeze a Smith & Wesson
When talk is not an option, it's a form of expression
You got to go to work on a nigga
The red shit comin' through the shirt on a nigga
My gift to a gravedigger

[Hook]
I get that dirt, you know that blow and baking soda be the recipe
Fasho I make that .40 Cali' blow, you get the best of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
I know for sure I'll split your mothafuckin’ head, you get to testin' me
You call the cops and I get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'



[Verse]
I'm on a hard bench trying to sleep in the holding pen
Man, how the fuck did I get here again?
First thing in a morning, it‘s the fuck shit
They called the case, I got confronted by a tough snitch
You told me do it, don't act like you ain't told me do it
You ain't a shooter, you a shermhead, you fucking loser
I fly the kite, my little man'll cut his sister up
He loves his bitch, you snatch her he'll start switching up
I'm cool, I just wait ‘til my next court date
I better catch amnesia then do this shit at leisure
Surrounded by Bloods, Crips, Kings, and Ñetas
Gemstars open niggas up like Berettas
I'm trying to be easy
But every now and then I gotta put it in, please believe me
You get to looking at me strange, I'm prepared, Jack
A buck fifty, keep the change, you can wear that


[Hook]
This is murder, this is not music
I had your style 10 years ago, I just didn't use it
You niggas forgot how I do it
Well, I do it like there's nothing to it

[Outro]
Yeah, all I'mma do is this, I'mma keep counting money
I don't give a fuck if it make you sick to see a nigga win
I'mma make you watch me win over and over again
You already know what it is with me, motherfucker
This year, goddamn it, you motherfuckers is making me lose count, man
Gotta start this shit over, I'm licking my fingers
I'm getting... I got 100 dollar bills, for real, nigga
All I'mma do is this man, you hear that sound in the background?
I'mma do this shit till my thumb get tired
I'mma take a break when I get past your momma house, nigga
When I count more than your momma house
I'mma take a break, go get a new stack
Hand me that money over there
What we gon' do? All year long
It's back to 50, you already know
Get the money, and shut the fuck up
Watch me do what I'm doing cause niggas can't stop nothing that I'm doing
Nothing I'm doing
Right after you get in the way we gon' start shooting again like it's nothing changed
We went through that whole "Kumbaya my lord - let's be friends by the fire"
Shit, it's over, nigga
Back to the script, you know how this shit go
How much is that?
Oooh, if you could see me right now, I got a alligator on, nigga
You, you think it should go different? See, that's where you go wrong
When you think... Who the fuck asked you to think, nigga?
Now you stick to writing comments and tweeting and your hashtags and
You know what the fuck you do, nigga, let me do what I do

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah... ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank y'all for comin' out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm

[Intro: Robin Thicke]
Girl when I go, where we go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got dough,  plenty baby you can blow with me
And baby I know that money ain't everything
But it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho')
And ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me
Now when I go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

[Verse 1]
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, "baby I apologize"
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha - I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin'
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fan about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggas are stressed, I pass the test
Every time I drop I'm burning hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't looking for commitment, we can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
You ready? Okay let me wind you up
Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These niggas is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he move like that
That's my muh'fuckin toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gon' pop that gat
You don't wanna play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fuckin with my toy soldier
If youse a casualty of war, trust me I got more
You don't want it with my toy soldiers

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience no morals or nothin
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggas hatin on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggas fo' sho' man, hold me down

[Hook]

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker
If you ain't 'bout it I don't want you around, cocksucker
Every word out my mouth is felt; that oo-wop pop
Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt - I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down - and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa, hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Two windows to a man's soul
... fill you with holes
Listen homey.. I'm the man for the job
So if he ain't.. (Yayo, c'mon!)

[Verse Three: Tony Yayo]
I'm in that two-door Phantom and the body's kitted
Waves in my head lookin like tsunami hit it
Niggas scheme, but the infrared beam's on the mack
I'll put green on yo' head like an Oakland A's hat
One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin for his enemies
Ridin gassed up, off double D batteries
His last casualties, is hooked to them IV's
(50 gimme the word) that's when I squeeze (yeah!)
Click-clack, take that, fall back
It's a contract, 50 grand, I'm 50 man

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Yeah! This is the general speakin (yeah)
When I say move (ha ha ha) nigga you better move
Soldier, ha ha
I don't want nobody talkin to none of my niggas
Come around here with that bullshit
Tryin to feed niggas bad information and shit
That's how my toys malfunction



[Sample: Intro]
The Business is entertainment
And what entertain the customers is the sight of blood

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Cam I mean, I was bein nice to him, Ok I'll get him

[50 Cent: Verse 1]
You niggas should worship the ground I walk on
I make mills off the tracks I talk on (It's king-pin)
50 don't call me nigga I don't wanna talk it out
The 40 cal'll hit yo' leg go on and walk it out
I see it clear you tryin to sabotage Jimmy
See what happens when you talk after sippin the Henny?
I'll send Haitian niggas at you yeah sak pase?
Zoe pound niggas they don't play
Buck stabbin niggas on camera and it's ok
Cause my money make my lawyers make the shit go away
Attempted murder, get a year on probation
Cam are you clear what you facin'?
You must ain't hear me, I done told you I'm a boss
I'm eatin good but I ain't chubby like Ricky Ross
Word on the street is, 50's not Jay
And Cam better stay out of his way

[Hook]
Everything's cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the I.C.U. tryin to hold on
Niggas in the waitin room been waitin so long
Till they hear the flatline the doc say he's gone, he's gone (Ha ha, that's fucked up!!!)
When they say he's gone (Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, he dead)

[50 Cent: Verse 2]
Well he knew that could happen fuckin with the kid
This is graveyard music right here ya dig?
This is not competition this is murder
Career endin, mind bendin, Southside ya finished
Now look niggas laughin at Cam down on Lennox
They heard what he did but they don't know why he did it
I have eighty of them boys with black flags, come through with black mags
And have you niggas zipped up in black bags
For a second he was hot now he cold
I apply pressure on niggas until they fold
But never mind me, man that's just how it be
The game got me trained they call me the hustle man
And like fame, my style will live forever
They thought I crossover, cause they don't know no better
I think they think I'm laxed now cause I got the cheddar
Till I return back bustin trust me it's nothin (OHHH!!!!)

[Hook]

[Outro]
DipSet! Cam stay up! I'm not gonna destroy DipSet...
Just gotta make changes, from now on, Jimmy's the boss, of DipSet!!!
And Juelz is the Capo (He's gone) Cam's demoted to soldier...
We like Jimmy better anyway!! Ballin'! Come on man
What's the last Cam joint you liked? Computers computin
Boogity boobity, Hahahahahaha!!!! (He's gone)
Cameron, you better learn how to talk to me!!! OHHHH!!!!



[Hook]
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and gone niggas gon' remember my name, 50

[50 Cent]
Black is flashy like Alpo, gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka 'mind me of nigga that clapped me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you tryna get your ass laid out in Gilmore
He had some soldiers, 'mind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like "What up comrade?"
Grimy niggas, they loved to get gully
Summertime, still had on black gloves and skullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggas from Philly woulda called him an old head
But he a OG, 'mind me of Chaz and Bump, real low key
Sounded like they don't know nothin about drama
His money sent many men through trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on his S-Class
Heard in DC, he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this, a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit, he got knocked
He on lock still controllin the spot from Comstock
Pop pulled up in the CL5, surprised he came
His man just got fucking murked by some lame
Heard he got it in the Range nigga Caine popped one
On his brain over some-thang, took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond mayne
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
"Down down baby," Nelly singin my wrist blingin what?
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise, three loaves for two pies
Son he smokin that shit, I can see it in his eyes
Comin up Wise and locs is close
And locs ride 'round lookin for wires to toast
Benny hopped out the Escalade with a few thorough men
From B-More, they sellin heroin in Maryland
His first batch of diesel, he killed like 4 fiends
His popularity grew, that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother, now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to livin the dream
Seen he pulled up, goddamn, you know his format
Bentley Azure, marble in the door, mink floor mats
Hit the hazards, out the stash box popped two Glocks
Theme song: "All Eyez on Me," 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Ty in the blue GS, stuntin like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max, Haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peeped his style son I know his steelo, he on the d-low
He smile at niggas mumblin fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggas tried to merk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a black Hummer, he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that, let's go

[Intro]
Okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay)
Okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
When they talk about me they say I be tripping (yeah)
What they say about me doesn't make me mad (nah, nah)
I think they hating cause they see me when I'm rolling (yeah)
Man, I can't help it that they really doing bad (nah, nah)
Okay, alright (they sick)
Okay, you're right (I'm rich)
Okay, alright (I grind)
Okay, you're right (for mine)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm in that 760 leaning when I'm stunting
I blow 50 G's, I mean with ease like this is nothing
Please don't interrupt me when I'm talking to my jeweler
He's putting them diamonds all over my Franck Muller
Me I get busy, I put that work in if it's worth it
Come through hit you up, I'll make a crime scene perfect
Niggas talk about me all the time behind my back
They don't talk about me in my face because I'm strapped
See me in the club, I got that Henny and that 'gnac
A couple cups of that and I just don't know how to act
By the second bottle that's when I just get to buzzing
I said I run New York and ain't nobody saying nothing (okay, okay, okay)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
When they talk about me they say I be tripping (yeah)

Okay, alright (they sick)
Okay, you're right (I'm rich)
Okay, alright (I grind)
Okay, you're right (for mine)

[Verse 2]
I blew a hundred G's on my bitches in Miami
They think I'm the sweetest thing invented since candy
Me I catch amnesia when you ask me 'bout the shotty
I don't even know my name, switching lanes in my Bugatti
Nigga, I ain't crazy, bitches like me cause I'm paid
They want me, LeBron, Kobe or Dwyane Wade
When I say I'm balling I'm not talking 'bout a ball
I'm talkin' 'bout Tiffany & Co. stones out the mall
Niggas they can hate all they want, but they know they like this
Me I'm like that painting on the wall, baby I'm priceless
You could come and work me over, baby, on the night shift
Catch me on the night shift, see how freaky I get (okay, okay, okay)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
When they talk about me they say I be tripping (yeah)

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Okay, okay, okay, okay - sho' you right
Okay, okay, okay, okay - you know you right
Okay, alright, okay, alright
Okay, alright, okay, you're right



[Hook]
It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say
Or Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain

[Verse 1]
No more freestyles and verses killing Sticky and Ja
I'm moving on now, I got bigger fish to fry
Since How to Rob, a lot of niggas been namin' names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas actin' like I don't get down or something
Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips 'til we run in your crib
And you gon' ask dumb questions like, "Can I live?"
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me, you're brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Tone and Poke, they better have my bail
But if its over a mil, don't put the crib up dun
Cause if fifty get free nigga, fifty gon' run

[Hook]
It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say
Or Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain

[Verse 2]
Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a poor no more
I ain't gotta steal from the corner store no more
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the floor no more
Bouncers don't try to play me at the dough no more
But when they see me, they say..
"Search him, he might have the nine"
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feeling it, the Benz pulling up on the set
Me jumping out, 30 thou on my neck
And since you said it was nothing to sweat
You was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kicking, Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how, he reacts under pressure
Til Makaveli returns, it's all eyes on me
Til the feds build a case or find files on me

[Hook]
It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say
Or Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain

[Outro]
It's gangsta, 2000 shit
Y'all know what you need to do, get together
Make a "We Are the World" record, faggot ass niggas



[Intro: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
Oh yeah
Look at you, you lil' dirty ass nigga you ain't shit
Ouuh
Bongo By The Way

[Hook: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now
I'm up nigga

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I ever said fuck you nigga I meant to
When you come up how I came up, life's not gentle
See that tear in my mama eye, that meant the rent due
I prayed on it, God didn't say nothing back
Saw that cocaine you had, we turned it to crack
Had a couple grams of diesel, we was just tryna make it
A brown sheepskin on, niggas was tryna' take it
You know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber
Niggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama
Suckers shit niggas get shot over some nah, nah
If niggas want problems I'm sayin' this no problem
I catch 'em on the late night and dearly depart 'em

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Look back
Look where we started from
It's all the beginning
They ain't tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When it's 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when...

[Hook: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now
I'm up nigga

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I remember all the shit you said to me 'cause it hurt me
Then it helped me 'cause then I was down to do the dirt
See the knots in my pockets boy, I go the cash route
I see you with your skinny jeans, punk, with your ass out
And I got all kind of money now
Look what you made me
Got a different type of temper, man a nigga get crazy
My A.P. look like I done dipped it in water, hard
Like me when I done dipped in your daughter (GOD!)
From playin' with Hot Wheels to collecting cars
That shit in the duPont REGISTRY's in my yard
Somehow the bullshit shifted
Now the motherfuckers calling me gifted
And I be like

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Look back
Look where we started from
It's all the beginning
They ain't tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When it's 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when...

[Hook: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing

[Hook]
Shorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off, just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round, stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like, I know just how to break you off

[Verse 1]
Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away, we be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now, that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks
(Oh, it's like that?) Yeah, it's like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosions, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that grip, that ride it nonstop

[Hook]

You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it

My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'mma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still {*phbbt*}
I shouldn't have to say it shorty you should know

I can break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon



[Intro: DJ scratching]
"Niggas bit off Nas shit" - Ghostface Killah
"Admit it, you bit it" - G. Dep
"Niggas bit off Nas shit, niggas, niggas, bit off, Nas shit" - Ghostface Killah
"Admit if, you bit it, bit it" - G. Dep
(Repeat)

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Hook]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

[Hook - Last line cut off]

"Niggas bit off Nas" - Ghostface Killah
"Admit it, you bit it" - G. Dep
"Tell these niggas somethin' God" - Ghostface Killah

[Verse 3 - Nas]
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike
50 Cent with Braveheart-ed, we ride to the grave depart us
You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

[Intro - Once]

[Hook]



[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Summer heat, hot, murder plots, niggas getting shot
Chrome rims for sixes, one wheel, one GSX-R
Throw it up, one hand, wave back at the bitches
I'm silent, right before I snap I'm violent
I call myself the tussle, I'm the boss and the muscle
Boy I feed your ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creeping through the fog, if you scared, get a dog
Get a male, because a bitch'll get you both in the morgue
Now peep the punchlines I'm punching these are knockout flows
I'm cyber pimping, I'm so new wave I got sci-fi hoes
This is next-level mack shit, that's why my money stack quick
12 V's V12 half of them triple black bitch
Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy envy, me
Your blinds blurring your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground, still gritty
Still running cities, Still Em, Dre and Fiddy, fuck with me
I'm an usual suspect when it's a hit
Turn up the volume and hear my voice, yeah it's the shit

[Hook]
Pardon me please, can I speak to you
Feel this is something, I'm compelled to do
Pardon me please, can I speak to you
Feel this is something, I'm compelled to do

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Pistols and bad bitcHes, Hustlers and bad business
Rapping was just a Hobby, tHat Hobby turned to a million
Had tHat oxy for sale, you can get it 50 a pill
Sniff it or let it grill, rap tHe foil you know tHe drill
Money, power, and drugs, my only reason to love
Never played cops and robbers, nigga we played Crips and Bloods
Like to tHe pimps saying wHo the sluts? 211 on Hookers purses
Another double up purcHase, slanging a Hundred meters from cHurcHes
God forgive me, but tHe steal was wortH it
Man I swear I needed some cHange, cHains and golden rings and tHangs
Niggas watcH videos and tHink tHem dudes went from rags to Hardest
For real lokes know tHat type of sHit makes you a target
EitHer tHe pigs or I'mma get you wHile you playing boy
Hunt you like an animal, strapped witH a beam tHat's adderall
50 told me ambition wins wHen your talent ain't working

[Hook]

[Outro: Schoolboy Q]
Floss if you want to I've seen your Home broke nigga

Make wHat you make in like 2 years, less tHan a montH nigga
Figg Side to SoutHside but we up nigga



[Hook - 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches

[Verse 1 - Kidd Kidd]
I'm smoking up my lungs, this liquor drowning my liver
I'm now using these prescriptions, these pancakes now full of syrup
Mayweather all contenders, I eat each rappers for dinner
Put these ratting ass niggas in a sewer, Master Splinter
Sound like my phone is bugged, give a nigga the jitters
I don't give a fuck, tell the pigs to kiss my shitter
Yeah, I'm kind of thinner but Goddamn, you're jeans are slimmer
I don't want you 'round my children, you look like a sex offender
Planet of the Apes, I'm a G-Unit gorilla
All these rappers claim they killas, prolly sue you when you hit 'em
See I'm not what you used to, I ain't soo-woo, I ain't crippin'
I'm a Rider Gang nigga, we gon' get it where we fit it

[Hook - 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Got a new bitch that's so bad, yeah, she don't know what she doin'
And her ass so round and fat, when she touch me, I'm like boooing!
I want head and I want tails, so I don't wanna flip a coin
I don't kiss it, I don't tell, so her close friend she can join
They don't call me from the pens, that's to see how things are goin'
So the money, it still flowing, get a Rider Gang, it's still glowin'
And my neck and my wrist and my ears and my fist, got diamonds all over shit glowin'
And the Lambo ain't got no top, it ain't summer yet but it's hot
You gon' lose the speech when you hit the streets and you see the bitches I got
You better believe it's real from the Philippines to Brazil
Lil Mexican chica, I want you to meet her, people can give it to you pure
100% uncut, now nigga you know wassup

[Hook - 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches

[Verse 3 - Kidd Kidd]
MJG, bitch I got them 8 balls
4 door garage, bitch, I need 8 cars
They want me locked up, they singin' like Akon
Or shot up like a dope head arm
Bitch my life right and you niggas dead wrong
I would take your head on, so you can see me head on
I'm gettin' my air blown, you know what her head on
She got my head gone, shit, I'm 'bout to head home
Pimp zone, that's my destination
Still street, never handed in my resignation
Ding dong, I'm at your doorbell waiting
Who tryna get served, I'm 'bout to do some catering, huh!

[Hook - 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches



[50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm fuckin wit dis
It's that classic shit, that gangsta shit, yeah

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin what if?
Homey I play the block tryin to get my packs off - sayin what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?

[50 Cent]
If I got on some pretty boy shit like Puffy
Niggas in the hood, man they just wouldn't love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
Niggas would think I bump my fuckin head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin to sell like Shady
If I put out bullshit joints like AZ
Every chance niggas get, they'd try and play me
But I move around with a little 380
A nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
I'd see the world different through my dilated pupils
If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
Niggas'll say "50 that ain't gangsta, fuck ya"
Man I'mma just keep doin what I do
Cause niggas can't do me, better than I do, ha ha

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith?
And all the backpack niggas loved me like Mos Def
I'd probably be a cool-ass nigga like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin so cool
What if I was a low-key nigga, just laid back?
Hustle to keep a homey 'round, somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?
Shit I'd give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught
Cause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap nigga you didn't know
You'd be sayin "Damn that kid got a sick flow"
What if I just cruised through your hood on 22's
Bumpin Curtis Mayfield or Marvin, somethin smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha ha

[Hook]



[Hook]
Got my guns and magazines
Ending up in front of me
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Bridge]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
I go to war to my heart stop
Niggas ain't listening
Get the thumping and the dumping at your newborn's christening
Tell your homie tell his homies
He 'gon need more homies
Ain't this a bitch I got the extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck
I dare a nigga to scheme on it
The ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give your ass a permanent nap-- sing you a lullabye
I got money to run, so fuck an alibi

[Bridge]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning or the night, I spot-cha I gotcha
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops asking 'who shot-cha'
As the world turns, (?) will be learned
The hollow tips burnin and I ain't concerned if I ain't hit
Than I ain't hit, so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you fucking with
Come through dump more than a clip
Niggas be on some stupid shit
Till they get hit, ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 3 - Kidd Kidd]
K-I double, shot gun barrel double
I always run a couple and I move 'em on a double
Racks in the duffel
Mac with the muzzle
Makin' circles in you, all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle
Can't stay outta trouble
I got a big gun, mutha-fuckers scuffle
Kidd Kidd, will you ever change?
FUCK NO! Pimp zone, Rida gang, you already fuckin' know

[Hook]
Got my guns and magazines
Ending up in front of me
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Bridge]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

[Verse 4 - Kidd Kidd]
Man these niggas so fake, I call 'em knock off
Light pringles high pop the top off
You ain't hot dog
You the fucking Micky Mouse (aw)
I'm on fire like Louisiana hot sauce
Brand new J's cost a buck fifty niggu
You scuff these I’ll scar your face, buck fifty, nigga
Been fucking with them pigs, you a guinea niggu
And you always begging, you's a ''give me'' nigga
I wear my gun like its trendy niggu
You pussies ain't shit, kitty litter
Uh, see where all that bitching getcha
Right in front of this pistol

[Hook]
Got my guns and magazines
Ending up in front of me
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Bridge]
Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

Hands was free, she on her menstrual

We can have a ball, we can do it all
Moonshine light up the sky at night time
Any time could be the right time
I’m sort of impulsive, I’m kinda explosive
Me, Take a little at a time in doses
Once you’re addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot, I’ll be there with the quickness
Give it to you good, when I’m gone I’m sure you gon miss this

Cause when I trip
A nigga trip (Nigga, fuck your clique, nigga)

You know every beef, I don't need my strap

You finna make me catch a case
Your new bitch my old hoe

Her head game was so-so
That's why I had to let her go, go
I'm blowin' up like I'm supposed to blow
Neck glowin' like it's supposed to glow

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mark Batson]

[Intro]
Dre, niggas think we're bullshitting

[Hook]
Nigga try me, son, he best have the heat on him
Whip him outta his clothes, get to mopping the street with him
Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 1]
Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out
Bushmaster hundred shot, drums'll run out
They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie
Me I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow
They make the hammers ring, they on ya ass now
Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah, niggas'll flip
Six shot semi assault, let it off at your will
Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz
If D's know about the beef, you gon' still get did
It be your tombstone and your fucking grave they dig
Have that ass in the precinct trying to talk to the pigs
I'm like Damien, nigga, when I start getting loose on ya
Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on ya
I make it hard to breathe
I come with your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat
Have you lookin' both ways like you crossing the street

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, niggas send me the wrong message, we gon' fucking kill the messenger
Your whole clique, hollowtips'll tear up the best of ya
This ain't the "Carter" nigga, this is Sparta
It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay' shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash gone
I was born with the tech, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-not's turn into Sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah, it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go 'head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I tell 'em ride on 'em then they ride on 'em
Get the line on 'em and squeeze the .9 on 'em
Headshot, .40-Glock blow his mind on him
It's a hit, not a jux leave the shines on 'em
Now you can watch me, nigga, like the police watch me
I move proper, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
That 430 Spider, carbon fibre
And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The Mack'll fire, mask like Michael Myers
It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop yo' ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
Yeah, it is what it is man
Uh-huh

Sirens flashin' you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', cross full of diamonds he bought grindin'
His first slip off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, askin' niggas if they know what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a lineup last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack
Figure, I'll push it to the limit, take the shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm's fully loaded firearm
First to let off last to run, every time it's on

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
Cause I don't need 'em
Cause they're, never around, when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'

(What? Nigga is there.. is there a motherfuckin problem nigga?)
(Oh, yeah that's what I, I thought so.. pussy!)

[50 Cent]
Niggas be talkin 'bout me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the 80's
Sayin they gon' do me somethin', now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong I let the hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire
I prevents runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on the barbed wire
This shit's crazy, it's just a different day it's the same shit
Hollow-tip partin' yo' head, leave your whole fuckin' brain split
They sick, they see me in that Aston Martin
What's the matter? They can't get that hooptie started
Thought they was grindin', well God damn, where that money at?
Thought you was puffed up, cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter fact, you's a buster
I don't trust ya, I should send niggas to touch ya

[Hook]

(What? Who say they gon' do somethin' to me?)
(Must be out your rabbit-ass mind, fuck around kill one of these niggas)

Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you ain't gon' be moving when this clip is through!

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm the one that bought all them bitches out
Got a G-A-T this MVP don't run his mouth, nigga
You gon' make me fill this clip for you
You gon' make me unload then reload 'em number 2
Nigga, I've been known to get them Oxys off
I believe in God, but cross my heart this nine go off
Nigga, I'm from the Mecca of the Groove
The Hoover Crip, I grew up on Figg I had to dodge them County Blues
Live my life behind the rules
Running from the cops, smash the rocks up under my shoes
Spit out the eighth that once, hid in my face
Bounce spring over the gate, didn't get caught
I guess my escape, nigga was fate
I love the block and all the dogs that kept me safe
Now it's, back to adding, points to the crime rate
Get slumped in your drive way
You gon' make me hurt your boy
You gon' make me put that work in boy
You gon' make me get to murkin' boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Focus on money, I'm in and out ass fast
She loosen up against the wall like a NASCAR crash
Got a bunch of enemies, I count my friends on one hand
Ghetto philosphy, watch me, I got a hundred scams
Like we could make a few dollars, that there a hundred grams
I got a gift, I communicate with the afterlife
Apparently, your bitch ass ain't acting right
Niggas killed your man, you ain't gon' get him back?
What? You is tired out? Why you ain't get around to that?
You wander, I travel, I have a destination
I'll be a street legend new version of Pappy Mason
My style? It'll never die, boy I'm immortal
You shoot me down, I'll get back up and keep coming for you
Man on fire, hitman for hire
Them niggas got happy they thought I was gon' retire
Now they bitch giving me head, I'm the man, a man admires
What's up?

[Hook:]



[Verse 1]
After two bottles of Moet and two bottles of Rose
Don’t dare say nothing to me, you niggas don’t know me
It’s ebony and ivory, the white boy, the black boy
Eminem and Fifty who the fuck slipped me a Mickey
There’s hollow’s in my tongue, Kush smoked in my lung
Codeine in my cup, look I don’t give a fuck
I took X and viagra and now my dick hard
Shining like diamonds floating round my sheppard
Look bitch this is my house, we got 50 fucking rooms here
Butlers, maids and them baccarat chandeliers
Dog named Oprah and a cat named Gayle
Stash in the floor in case I got to make bail

[Hook]
Happy New Year
I got some liquor, got some hoes
Got the music playing come and have fun
Happy New Year
I got some kush got some purple
Got some Dro’ in case you wanna smoke some
Happy New Year

Some Patron, man I know you want some
Happy New Year
I got some porn star bitches in the back
Freakin off you wan come?

[Bridge]
First nigga front I’mma shoot me a chump
I stuff 2 million in my Lambo trunk
Me I do whatever the fuck I want
You must be confused, me I never lose
Fuck me? No, fuck you

[Verse 2]
White people fuck with different drugs
That shit ain't hit the circuit yet
Niggas fuck with dope and coke not vicodin and percocets
Tonight I’m open minded, fuck it I’ll give it a try
What does it matter anyway, gettin’ high’s gettin
How many shots will it take to make a nigga to drop his shit
Like he having convulsions, choking, eyes open
Bong smoking, thats the shit you’ve seen in high times
Stay float underwater that shit look like a grapevine
I started out with one pill, now I’m taking ten a day
Em said I need help, Dre said that shit ok
Next thing you know a nigga sittin’ up in AA
Hi, my name is Curtis Jackson, I’m an addict, gotta have it

[Hook]
Happy New Year
I got some liquor, got some hoes
Got the music playing come and have fun
Happy New Year

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
When they say my time is up
And I am just collecting dust
Don't turn on me, don't turn on me
And when they claim that I'm washed up
Or when my guns begin to rust
I'm warning you, don't turn on me

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
December 9, '97 I told Jay I'm gonna' blow
Failure's not an option, my son's turning one years old
I wrote a verse about the night I just spent in Central bookings
Cause my grandpa coffee pot had cocaine cookin'
Fast forward my grind, 9-8-'99 more eigths more O's
Broken in nickels and dimes
I told niggas I'd make it, they was doubting me then
Picture me zonin' on the park bench pushin' my pit
Who needs enemies, my friends keep shootin' my friends
They takin' hits now, they'll blow your brains out for a Benz
Call me a dreamer, cause I could see myself on top
Word to Sabrina, I'm gettin' my ass off this block

[Hook]

[Interlude]
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Ain't it funny how the niggas I came up with wasn't bumpin' me
Product of the slum, I guess its misery loves company
Told em' i’m a winner , i’d be something to believe in
They was more concerned who was rollin' up the weed did
Jay & Jay didn't work, neither did Columbia
Got shot, got dropped, one hell of a summer huh?
One year recovery feel like a bag of broken bones
Bill collectors come around thats when you know you're on your own
Strap the vest, cock the chrome, they countin' me out, I'mma show em
I fought my way out of mother fuckin' corners before
I'm better under pressure I'm built for it
Been the under dog all my life, I'm still here boy

[Hook]

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Em and Dre gave me a shot and I ran with it
Homie in the cell saying "damn, my man did it"
Get Rich Or Die Trying made it to the top
I'm fightin' off my competition trying not to drop
It seems like no one seen him fuckin' with the kid
All they see was me tryna take off their fuckin' head
They don't see the slap, all they hear is the shot
As soon as somebody hit, I'm sure they'll run to the cops
How am I the bully of the East if I don't start no beef?
I meet aggression with aggression, I learned that on the streets
I see em frontin' on they blogs, sayin' I'm done
Like I ain't got that flow they know be number one

[Hook]

[Interlude]



This is 50

[Hook]

Not to spray this shit
I got enough ammo shots blow I put a hole
In any motherfucker out this bitch

You gon' be strong enough to take this shit
I'm in the hood ridin' 'round with a chrome four pound
Can you see through the limousine tints?
I do dirt, the gat bust, I get to kickin' up dust
'fore the Jakes come around here kid
Niggas get knocked if D's start askin' question
My name end up in all types of shit

For that cake, I get rid of dem bricks

Every time I get a brand new whip

Then I went back and got that six
I'm in a big white Benz on a hot sunny day
I call it the milk truck and shit
I'll have your ho eyeballin' at the light, damn pimpin'
You should take time to check that bitch
Find me ridin' through the hood actin' like it's all good
But I'm looking for a jux and shit
In the middle of the night, you can turn on the light
Find me and my niggas in yo' crib
Nigga holla if there's a problem and yo' niggas got drama
I got burners for sale and shit
Got them MAC's, got them 9's, got them techs full of dime
Hollow-tips and them extra clips

Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
They can't hustle when I'm in this shit
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
You don't listen, you gon' get yo' ass hit

[Outro]
Yeah, nigga cherish me
Like the water you drink

You need me to live

[Hook]
I got a clip for a nigga tryna stunt on me

[Verse 1]
So what you got a Benz? I buy my bitch a Benz
Them niggas you be fucking with, I wouldn't fuck with them

I sell them whole ones, you sell ten dollar rocks, bitch
Man, get your weight up, I said get your weight up
Stay in your place 'fore you get your ass sprayed up
Man, I ain't ever scared, I got all kind of guns
I'm getting plenty bread, I throw the hoes to one
Strip, bitch, you heard me? I said strip, bitch
I'm cold as ice, check the temperature on my wrist, trick
I blew three hundred grand, what kind of watch is that?
I bet you wanna know, stop tryna jack my swag, ho
Gucci, Fendi, Prada and that Louis, now I'm hotter
So it's Tom Ford and Armani, YSL, I'm fly as hell

We're strapped in this motherfucker, now understand
Banana clip, banana split, I be on some gangsta shit
Dump 30 here, dump 30 there, I make it hot up out this bitch
My diamonds bigger, grimy niggas, city slicker, pull the trigger
Line a nigga, it's a stick up, money pick up, dust kick up
Tires screeching when I'm reaching, 50 preach in church, bitch
This is pimping, fuck around and end up in the worst shit
Hollow tip, .40 mag, bloody rags, toe tag
Body bag, killer swag, blood all on my Gucci shit
Now I'm mad in the Jag, same day, this is bad
Fucking fag, look at your ass, why you make me do this shit?
I'm built for this, so I was told
Since mama gone I've been on my own
I'm for real about it, man, fuck how you feel about it
Nigga, we in the streets, that's why we holdin' heat

[Hook]

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggas running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 1]
I know Boo Boo I mean 50 he a grimey nigga
Think he shot my brother I'm a find that nigga
We don't see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he don't wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that chalk gray Land
That nigga robbin' and stealin' everything that he can

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Yeah I know Curtis, he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in his Benz
Niggas from my buildin' always used to ask about him
Like he in and out of town, right? That niggas get down, right?
I used to say, all I know, is the nigga get money
And you standin' in my way, excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 3]
I love 50 Cent, that's my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy
They just like him cause he roll with Dr. Dre and Shady

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggas running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 4]
Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
I can't believe this nigga gettin' all this money
Still actin' like he in the street tellin' niggas they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggas out
That's that bullshit. See what I'm talkin' about?

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 5]
That's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin' sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock or pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car
I taught him what it takes, to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

Nigga you confused (CH'EAH!) - let me choose!

[Kardinal Offishall:]
AYO! - One "Licka Officer" walked the earned stripes, (BOOO!)
Two Licka pigs gon' get shot another night. (BOOO!)
Homicide would love for me to take a ride
But I ain't touch pork unless it's dead on the side
With a fork in it, police can suck my third leg! ('ey!)
Lock my niggas up beca' dem look like the dread. (oh, why?)
In the photo that was pointed out by one of your snitches
That worked at mr.Chows in the back doing dishes
That was upset with seein' all them niggas gettin' money
Coming inside the spot, treat the white folks funny
Flashin' all that paper, 30 deep up in the spot
That's why IRS come through to bum that club. (eeee-eeeeeah!)
We ain't waitin' for the boss man to come with no pig
Cause the crew that you deal with spray, (50: YEAH!) they don't say it. Nigga!

[Hook: 50 Cent (Kardinal Offishall)]
Eeny meany miny moe!

Eeny meany miny moe!
Eeny meany miny moe! (KARDINAL!)
Nigga you confused - let me choose! (EEEEAA!)

[Kardinal Offishall:]
Hey yo, you took one of ours, now we even in the score
We ain't playin that civil rights thing no more!
No more homies holding hands, we are armin' up for action
The revolution is to the guys like Mike Jackson
No more shootin' niggas 41 times. (NOOOOO!)
No more blastin' us after you sniff lines! (NOOOOO!)
No more sellin' coke to me! Cause when I distribute to you
I get my rights read, pig, FUCK YOU!
WITH A BROOMSTICK! - Who this pig think he is?
Bastard only mean to get spit on by our kids. (CH'EAH, KIDS!)
In the area, cause none of us respect the games
And we already know what provoked all the raids
You sold them guns, now they blastin' you sell the bullets
They shoppin' real heavy like a plane propellor. (blat! blat! blat! blat! blat! blat! blat! blat!)
I ain't sayin' kill nobody B's in blue
Keep it up and you get a park named after you!

[Hook: 50 Cent (Kardinal Offishall)]

[50 Cent]
Yeah.. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-UNIT!

[Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
I'm wide awake but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death waits for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through Mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, Papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggas hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustling backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you moving forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third

[50 Cent]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my M-1 shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain"
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin' good
Or cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, lets get it poppin'

G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit!



[Produced by Adam Deitch & Eric Krasno]

[Hook]
Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

[Verse 1]
Fuckboy, you can see it to believe it
Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me, its easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you
I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting
Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass
Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav
Nigga, its not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash
I wave the Uzi at them, I make a movie out them

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You better lose yourself in the moment
Use it, fuck the music, I'mma let it go
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At your hat, your back, your ass crack, your nutsack
Your Cadillac, if you make it to that, I'm hitting that
The 70's was smack, the 80's crack
The 90's was grimy, millennium MACs, man
Clips on the whips I ride in them, bad bitches, I ride in them
Don't worry, I'll get them, gat's jammed or unjammed
God damn safest the safety don't work, squeeze the eagle, it chirps
End up faced down in the dirt more than hurt
Bring the beef where you hang out, bang out, shots ring out
Hit your shoulders trying to blow your brains out
Hit your homies in their legs, bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep your heart beating, then your ass awake

[Hook]



[Hook]
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker [x2]

[Verse 1]
I had a five hundred bags, 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect, this shit last about an hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work
My niggas go bizzurk, when the drought come get murked'
When no money coming in is when the guns come out
Why the d's wanna sit in front of my momma house
You know it's sort of like some shit you seen in a flick
Black nine extended clip as long as my dick
They say I'm grimmey, yeah fuck it I line niggas
I show them where your shit at before they take mine nigga (Hahaha)
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigga
Figure, this is a dog-eat-dog world, man
Ebony enemy today I'm tryin' to duck, I got that hover
I heard it'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop girl)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave up and down you'd be like “I could just kill a man”
I don't fuck with them niggas from her projects
They're on section eight but niggas cars are straight
They ain't out in the day time them niggas roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toaster
I'm in the six four five hard top, not the drop
Leanin', I see them niggas schemin', dream on
Touch me, shit I wish a nigga would
I'll have my niggas deep, I have them light up they whole hood

[Chrous]
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker [x2]

[Verse 2]
They said I fell off, my Benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggas spot start gettin' stuck (shiiiit..)
I say ‘I ain't know none about nothing'
I'm on the low, niggas really know me for stuntin'
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsom, your bitch blowin' me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the misses, damn
I'm starting think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't gotta hold that for me
And slide by my baby momma crib with the mac on me
Man since her cousin in a car crash died
She said ‘don't drink and drive', I say ‘just drink, don't drive'
I had a morphine dream, I got heroine ambitions
That's big money cooking in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate I double up the cake (hey)

I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker [x2]

[Outro]
You'se a purse snatchin' ass nigga man
You'se a petty nigga
I can look at you, I can tell you'se a petty nigga
You'se a car thief
You'se a idibitty nigga, I'm a big city nigga
New York City Nigga



[Produced by Havoc]

[Intro]
Ay, nigga tell 'em where you from
Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what?
Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up

[Hook]
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

[Verse 1]
I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga
Saying I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger
After niggas jumped me bumping my head
Thinking I wish I had a gun, I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife to finna poke me a nigga
Wishing I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy
Now those were the days, when crime really paid
The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way
From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
Robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnapped Drew grandpa kid
Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head
You wonder why I got a gun? So I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids
Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
Yeah, yeah I had a dream
I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
Saying ''damn, dope cost sixty a gram'
I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "give it up kid, before I put one in your wig"
Picture me thirsty, riding 'round foaming out the mouth
Saying "I don't get on, I'mma lay a nigga out"
Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious
I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace
I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny
Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny
Fuck with me, y'all niggas know Boo Boo get busy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggas
Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggas
In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spofford, but never that now
When my name in your mouth you better watch how you talk
I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit
Thats how the eses play, for that SSK
You probably heard through the grapevine, I'm good out in Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruising through them Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West
In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest
And you niggas best be on yo' best behavior
I was bred for this shit, front on me I'mma blaze ya

[Hook]



[Jamie Foxx - singing]
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh

[50 Cent - talking]
Yeah, uh huh, I like the way that feel

[Hook - 50 Cent]
I'll build you, but if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me, you'll be around
Hold me down, I'll build you up

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
Listen, if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
It's the secret, I want the world to know that you're mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon' play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon' stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I'm from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I'll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that's a secret (shhh...)

[Jamie Foxx - Hook]
Baby I build you up
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
Oooohhhooohhh yeah
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure, right now
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
I thinkin' 'bout you thinkin' that you feel the same way
Or is it just my imagination that get runnin' away?
If you ready to ride, girl, c'mon, let's roll
G-5-5 fly, ma, let's go
It's hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my presence
Your smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I'll pick out some shit
One pair at a time 'til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we'll be together probably
For better or worse, like Whitney & Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it's more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
Cause I know with you by my side there's nothing I can't do, yeah

[Jamie Foxx - Hook]
Baby, girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Oooohhhooohhh
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine
Build you up, baby, when you're down
Cuz your smile, like a frown, yes I will
I'm gon build you up baby
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh [repeat 8x]



You think you know me? (Officer Ricky)
Nigga, You don't know me! (Officer Ricky)
50... ayo! C-O!

I put a razor thru ya face, I put a nine on my waist
I cock the shotty just in case, I pump nothin' but bass
I put a pint of blood in the whip, a pint of blood on the ground
Bullets, bullets get to ricochetin bouncing all around
That body all case cold I got her white wit it
If they ask me I think niggas from basely did it
I'm a southside nigga, we take on all comers
The first shot pop, we get to warrin all summer
These niggas ain't hard I get on em on some different shit
Different strap, different clip, I blow the door off your whip
The cop fucked fox, sucked the cunt on the bimbo
Faggot must've thought he knock me out like Kimbo
With gondorea lips, his breath stronger than endo
Fat fuck playing Wii Fit Nintendo
Have another tattoo, here's another tattoo
Run into my goons soon, have new bullet wounds

Officer Rickyyyy, radio for backup
See ya ass anywhere you know I'm gon act up
You want play with me, when I don't want play?
Have my niggas whip the skin off your ass in broad day
Screaming boss, nigga you ain't a boss
Pussy nigga ya lost , listen officer Ross
I tell you straight suck a dick
You tryna come with subliminals
Cuz your ass the police
My niggas is criminals
It's like every other word out your mouth bout a bird
Like you sling cocaine, this shit is absurd
You's a rapper, you's a motherfuckin rapper
It's a wrap, your career is fuckin wrapped up

My enemy's enemies are my friends
And my semis they like Siamese twins
See em up close, you won't see shit again
Like every fairytale, boy your life has to end
Try me, get blown away way way
Go 'head try me, get blown away way way
Try me get blown away way way
Go head try me, get blown away way way

(We the best!)
Yeah, you the best, you the cocksucking best
Go 'head faggot, depp throat it, feel it in your chest
I'm not friendly, I'm anti-social
Go 'head try me, I'll be fucking ya up, like I'm supposed to
You say I'm violent, now why you say I'm violent?
The mac got a muffler, make a loud mouth silent
Now Me, I'm kinda sensitive, So watch the way u talk to me
Ya better off shootin me, or tryna put the hawk to me
The beef ain't shit to me, cuz now I got the wolves out
That fo-fo pull around, that tre pound bulls out
I do it for the moula, boo-ya, bullseye
Pop ya fuckin noodles, deputy do die
Many men wish death, many men "oh doe"
I make many millions, fuck wit me, that's a "no no"
This is motion picture shit, there's no director to cast me
The D's, I plead the 5th on every question they ask me

My enemy's enemies are my friends
And my semis they like Siamese twins
See em up close, you won't see shit again
Like every fairytale, boy your life has to end
Try me, get blown away way way
Go head try me get blown away way way
Try me, get blown away way way
Go head try me get blown away way way

Nigga I bleed blue, I swear I bleed blue
You thinkin I'm a crip, I'll motherfuckin trip
The cool-out blood, maybe I'm all blood
Find out what a nigga bout when you catch a slug
Maybe I'm maniac, maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm exactly what my fucking hood made me
Maybe I'mma do 25 years for murder
Maybe cuz it's clear I'm the clip inserter
I done lost my best friend, he died of cancer
Call me a cheetah, I attack like a panther
It's teflon vinyl on my drop-top phantom
Bulletproof windows, and a stash for the cannon
Nigga if you cross me, you gon' have to off me
I just keep going no matter where they lost me
You know I'm like a time bomb- bomb steady tickin
You know what's coming next, once nigga slap the clip in
Oh yeah

My enemy's enemies are my friends
And my semis they like Siamese twins
See em up close, you won't see shit again
Like every fairytale, boy your life has to end
Try me get blown away way way
Go head try me get blown away way way
Try me get blown away way way
Go head try me get blown away way way

Shady After-motherfucking-math nigga
3 headed monster - 50, Em, Dre
Fuck with it if you want nigga



[50 Cent]
Look at what they did to me, they burn me, they turn me
Into a animal, they flipped son, they burn me
To the first degree, me son, they hurt me
I looked out for them motherfuckers, they burn me
I was good now I'm bad, see they done turned me
Into a monster, I can't believe they burned me
I showed 'em love, they showed me hate, they burn me
Now I'm heartless, your pain don't concern me

I got so many enemies, so many memories
So many flashbacks, we used to be friends
Sugar turned to shit, people just change
They keep pushin a nigga 'til the hammer go BANG
You violate I will let that motherfucker rang
Feels like, money came then, more money came
And, niggas start foamin out the mouth growin fangs
Now, when did I become the savior of the hood?
Look homie you don't know me, I wouldn't save ya if I could
I sacrifice for suckas and they change me, I'm angry
They selfish, all they want is what they want so they blame me (wow)
Like it's all my fault they ain't caked up
You a grown-ass man, damn, when you gon' wake up?
Turn, 7 to 14, 14 to 28
An O to 62, nigga get up your weight
Learn how to duck the jakes, stack your paper then you're straight

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I tried to help a nigga eat, man it's hard out on the street
Cause I'm kind they think I'm weak (they burn me)
They see the way I grind and they like the way I shine
They want paper like mine (they burn me)
Man they be on some shit when they tryin to hit a lick
Man a motherfucker flip (so they burn me)
You think they won't trip cause you helped 'em from the rip
They ain't loyal to SHIT!

[50 Cent]
She called the cops on me, cause I don't love her like I used to
Tried to fix what was wrong; guess it hurts cause I'm gone
My son he love me but she tryin to poison his mind
Actin like, everything they got ain't come from my grind
I say a prayer for her like "God, please change her heart"
All this hatred at one time is tearin me apart
Man I ain't lookin for trouble, I'm lookin for blessings
But ever since the money came, me I been stressin
Got my ass kicked for bein kind, I can't trust nobody
The closer they get to me the more they take from me
Man, I'm givin all I got to give, I'm tryin to live
They look at me they eyes got dollar signs, they want the kid
To give it all up, fall apart, break down
I ain't got much left, what they wan' take now?
My life? I got so much more to offer
I'mma make 'em watch me be #1 'til I'm done, yeah

[Hook]

[50 Cent (+ Governor)]
They bringin me all, the way dowwwwwn
(Everybody's tryin to bring me all the way down)
And betray me just becauuuuse (betray me) I'm down (just because)
I, don't know, what, to do nowwwww (I don't know what to do)
Me? My loyalty's, what I'm 'bout
Ha ha (that just happens to be what I'm about)
They burn me, over and over and over (over and over again)
Like they doin what they supposed ta
They burn me, goddamn look at how they do me (look at how they do me)
Somebody new tryin to sue me
So they burn me (after all I've done)
So they burn me
(Seems like I can't find a friend, every time they burn)

[Verse 1]
You want a problem with me? - no problem, it's all good
I ain't fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Black rims, black hemi, nigga see me when ya see me
I appear and disappear with the heater like a genie
That party and bullshit'll get ya ass popped
Don't believe me - ask Fab, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do dirt like worms
Smoke on weed not on sherm, nigga it's my turn
I fire on ya ass, them hollow-tips burn, baby burn
I'm screaming "Fuck the cops!", riding 'round with my Glock
There's my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck that box
That's how P. got knocked, thats's a jewel I drop
But you ain't peep that nigga, go 'head, repeat that nigga
You might learn a little something if you learn to stop fronting

Rolling locc-ing, up early with the dopemen

And lace up the Chukkas, we can rob these motherfuckers
My stomach is growling, they say that I'm wildin'
I'm doing my numbers, I'm getting violent
They hearing me rap and they thinking I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame
I need full co-operation man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill, we ain't playin'
I fire that thing, it sound insane
Holla, I got that nose candy, mane

One in the head, I take the clip out

That was Big with all that "let the bullets breathe"
I need a fully loaded clip



If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl
Ah man
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl

[Verse 1]
I'm waitin' on you to come, baby I'm that man
Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman
I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth, CPR
Bring ya back to life, climax, start your after life
Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic
Have it how you want it, my back shot's bionic
She givin' me something I can feel like En Vogue
Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back on
Back at it, fuckin' up the sprigs in her Craftmatic
Jack rabbit, addiction, I don't wanna break that habit
Your boy toy man, child it's cool, you can play with me
City life, bright lights, tonight you can stay with me
I wanna share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk
Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park
Bullseye right through her head, to her heart
It's mental and physical, when you're gone, I'll be missin' you

[Hook]
You gon' get it, you gon' get it
I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl)
Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (haha)
I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?)
When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl)

[Verse 2]
I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack
2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that
The touchin' and the teasin', the pleasure's the reason
I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin' and strokin'
Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor, I make her smile while passin' time
It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play, until I touch her 'til she cream
Cash rules the shortie, she's something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel, she in between
Got that island girl swag, she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot, that ass is mine
See how I switch gears, her bra gone it's on
It's showtime, it's my turn to perform
Leave the lights on, while I get it, I got it good
She sayin' she love my show, I'm sayin' I knew she would

[Hook]
You gon' get it, you gon' get it
I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl)
Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (haha)
I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?)
When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl)

And a nigga still ridin with the chopper on me

Fuck, nut, get up, that's abortion money

Mucho dinero out in México, they growin my weed
It's amazing, I made it here on my own
I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to count, the amount I spent
Wine cellar full of shit, we could all get bent
I got it made, I got bridge truck money
Euros, grams[?], you wan' borrow some from me?
My bank statements have you niggas like "Damn!"

Got shit locked, I stunt non-stop

Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talids and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (when I say dead, you dead)

[Verse 1]
Nigga I show you my teeth all through the beef
Paint the sidewalk red with the back of your head
Shootouts in my hood like a daily routine
D's think Im involved with a nigga hit hard
So when I empty the shell and the hollow tips fly
Nigga You can cross your heart and hope not to die
Come through squash the drama send niggas with llamas
They'll eat your ass up fuck being masked up
I was given the gift of life
First Sabrinas since then Ive been jammed up
And fucked with the nina
Nana raised nine kids I turned out the meanest
I mean a menace
Fuck with me and your finished

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Homie I always pay my debts when I owe a nigga bullets
Got an arsenal of infiltry and niggas to pull it
Go head stay out on me, dump weight its nothing
I chase a nigga down, and touch him, catch him and buss him
Bitch get out the way, baby while I spray it
I wet a nigga like a hydrant on a hot summer day
But you can catch me in May riding down with the K
Better watch what you say, we get it popping today
Yeah me I make it hot round here, I call the shots round here
I have a nigga tearing off your top round here
This is a land of broken hearts, where bullets shatter dreams
And everything a nigga want is only triple beams
Southside

Bobby was a fuckin bum, he pumpin packs now
He need some fresh chicks, white tees and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock a wino, he won't put the 'gnac down
Eric had the jump shot, but he's smokin' crack now
The Lunatics, the Lost Boyz, Cheeks shit is whack now
Country blew trial, them crackers got him on his back now
And Sean {*ka-click*} runnin round with his fuckin gat now
Up in niggas cribs, sayin "where that money at pal?"
Now Sandra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch travelled the world, she runnin round boostin
Now Toya got these bad-ass kids, they a nuisance
Her baby daddies never come around, they useless
Every now and then I come through on some new shit
Pearly white 6 or some chrome deuce-deuces

[Hook 2X]
I'm so hood - I can't help it
I'm so hood - I can't help it
Love me for bein me - cause I can't change it

So love me for bein me

[Verse 2]
When I was six man, momma told me God don't like ugly

Saw Owen every mornin before school, he sell dope
Niggas keep whuppin' Nut ass cause he sell soap

Flip be down on 1-0-9, rollin up smoke
Shameek, he a thief, catch a stunt in a stolen car
He that nigga that you call when you crashin into a bar
See they love me cause I rap now, but they don't like me
I been locked up three times and they ain't write me
Stevie a punk, but fuck what he say, he can get mean quick
Pop shots at you, Esau must suck a mean dick
The block's hot, D's jump out on us almost all the time
They watch us from the buildin but niggas still be on the grind
Wayne used to call the cops and tell them G had a 9
Til G put that gun in Donrad seat and said it wasn't mine

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah!

[Bridge]
You see a nigga soft? - My first instinct is to lean on him! (lean on him...)
A weak nigga eatin' in my hood? Niggas'll put a beam on 'em! (beam on him...)
These niggas ain't s'pposed to be eatin', yo! - They sweet as Sweet'N Low
I'll have 'em like shit was all good just a week ago. ("Lights oooooooon! ")

[Verse 1]
Let these fake niggas get you in the mood for looove
I'm back to get you in the mood for the Snub and gloooves
Dope fiend, morphine, cocaine dilemma;
Crack come to cookin' up that; boy, I'm a chemist!
Fuck pill poppin'; a strap, I pop that!
Watch the Henchman trial, see a rat rat on a rat!
You got a nice gimmick goin', you've been hot a few summers
But I got the kinda flow that'll stop World hunger
SK, I got nothing but energy! (energy!)
Call me Fifty, call me "Ferrari The Remedy"! (Remedy!)
"Hi" again in case a hater don't remember me
I happen to be what these rap niggas here pretend to be
Hittin' you won't be enough, you gotta finish me
Or it's Ruger time, - the SR-9!
Fragments ricochet and ya ass go blind
Times up, ya fucked! - Gotta learn to duck. - Whassup?

Don't make me, - don't make me
Don't make me! - seem so complicated
Don't make me, - don't make me
Don't make me - show you wassup. - Don't make me fuck you up!

[Verse 2]
Listen! Any bitch on the milk box ain't missin'
I mean some of these hoes runnin' round with Pippen
I'm writin' reality, it sounds haaarsh;
Shyne tried to get at me, he say I'm waaashed!
I ain't even fire back, the shit's squuaashed
What kind of shit is that? - This only happens in rap!
These niggas so fake, it make my skin craaawl
Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the waaall
Ice chunks in the chain, - weight spinnin'
Cream linen. - Bulges from the Benjamin's in 'em!
Tom Ford? - Oh, Looord!
If I ain't know better, I think a nigga push raaaw
It feels like it's never gon' stop
A nigga so hot! - I may spend forever on top!
"Forever ever, ever"? - Forever in the drop
You can't tell I got it on lock? - Bitch!

[Hook]
Don't make me, - don't make me
Don't make me! - seem so complicated
Don't make me, - don't make me
Don't make me - show you wassup. - Don't make me fuck you up!



[Hook: Olivia]
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
I'll be around to catch your call
Cuz you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I'll never ever let you wait
Cuz you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)

[50 Cent]
I'm from, city to city, to show to show
See me I been grinding across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grip fa'sho
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, what's on your mind when you alone
I have you touching on yaself, girl all in the zone
Now if I turned you on
With things I say, would I be wrong?
Then I don't wanna be right
Matter of fact, I'd be on the next flight
Trying to get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piping hot
While the wind blow through ya hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me do what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after it's all over
In the morning, roll over and we can start over

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I called just to say
"Hope you're having a nice day"
You're special, I'd get into you
Oops, I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet, to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
Yeah, Bubbles in the bath, Don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
It's fun, but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots, I like Jeeps and Coupes
So I grind all the time to save me some loot
I put a spell on ya, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom working it well, I don't kiss and tell
But I don't care if you kiss and tell
You can tell ya girlfriend the details

[Intro]
This is how monsters function
Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

[Verse 1]
Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo-Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me, baby, take me
Since high school, nigga, I ain't got no friends
Got two 380s like the Ying Yang Twins (Haaan)
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill herringbone, I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Ruger, that Pump and that Tec at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body
Then I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit, you got to love it
Trey-eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping, niggas hold down the tools

[Hook]
I seen niggas getting rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of not having shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggas getting hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slinging that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Verse 2]
Unsure since we was little niggas, son, since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his Camry with a seven
He a lucky motherfucker, I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man? How much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse, she thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money, son, cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub

[Bridge]
The Lord don't have imperfections, baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazing

Even when I ain't there lil' nigga, I run New York
I said the walls have ears lil' nigga, I hear when you talk
Let's get this shit clear lil' nigga, I run New York
(Here we go now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I wake up, stare at the ceilin, I'm alive, what a beautiful feelin
I put my vest on, right after I put on my draws
It's a habit I'm always prepared for war
See my life's like some shit you seen in a flick
Bitches act like porn stars when they sit on the dick
When I was gettin out the game I said one more flick
Test my aim in the range I'm like one more clip
It's my brain I'm insane I be on some shit
Man I run Interscope, Jada's tryin to annoy me
He's nothin but another disgruntled employee
Been in the game ten years, and he still ain't rich
Even his momma upset that he still ain't shit
But he keep runnin his yap like I'm a take all that
One more word out his mouth I'll push Styles shit back
See the nozzle on my trey pound is three inches long
And the kick on the four four's is extremely strong
With a lil' trey deuce it's like pop, pop
Chase his ass up the block till his bitch ass drop
And them verses he be kickin, none of 'em hot
Cause he ain't got none of that shit he sayin he got
And he ain't did none of that shit he sayin he did
And I ain't got, time to be talkin bout this shit, fuckin faggot!!!!

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I gets busy lil' nigga, I run New York
Yeah I live in C.T. lil' nigga, but I run New York
I don't go to parties lil' nigga, but I run New York
And I stay gettin cheese lil' nigga, cause I run New York
Yayo tell 'em I run New York

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
My money longer than yours, nigga call your recruits
The LOX made more money, in them damn shiny suits
The game about sales, drugs and rappin
Jada fuck your punch lines, my shirt went platinum
Styles and Sheek Louch, went double plastic
Yayo, Buck and Banks is puttin out classics
A hundred shots a hundred clips y'all ready to die
Fat Joe ain't a gangsta he scared to fly
Automatic Mossberg who want a piece of this pump
I'll have Ja Rule buried, in some high heel pumps
Vest up in the bulletproof man fuck that
Homie shoot up my whip all you leave is a scratch
Yo I flip cocaine in your project lobby
And beat you with my pistol like Kane did Chauncey
It's T.O.N.Y. Y.A.Y.O
My whole click got dough my hoes on the fly home
G4's, we fly on leers
And my rocks lookin like, flashlights in my ears nigga

[Hook: 50 Cent]
When I'm in D.C. lil' nigga, I tell 'em, I run New York
When I'm out in Philly lil' homie, I run New York
When I'm in V.A. I tell niggas guess what I run New York
When I'm in N.C. niggas holla at me cause I run New York
Yayo tell 'em I run New York

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yo who the fuck told this lil' nigga he can talk to me like that?!!
If I catch him I'll bawl him up and roll him somewhere, ha ha ha ha!!!!

[Intro]
Money make a pimp, pimp hoes
Hustlers sell dope, thugs gun smoke, what?
Money make the world go round as the world turns
Money make the world go round as the world turns

[Verse 1]
Nigga I need money to maintain, hustlin' ain't a game
Nigga go against the grain gon' get tore out the frame
TVs in the Range, I'm into nice thangs
I slang weed, cocaine and heroine
50 Cent, that's my name, nigga I bring the pain
You thought shit stay the same, nigga shit gon' change
Put a bullet in your brain, nigga at close range
Run away with ya rollie, your rings and your motherfuckin chain
Ain't nothing funny mang, I'm about my money mang
Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playin
Better understan what I'm sayin what I'm sayin, I ain't playin
I'll be in front of your crib, layin, with the Mac to start sprayin
Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lame
Crackers'll put ya in chains, box'll drive you insane
Sun can't shine all the time, man it's gotta rain
That ho loose as hell, you betta crack the whip, mang

[Hook]
A pimp ain't a pimp with no mothafuckin' hoes
A hustler ain't a hustler with no mothafuckin' dough
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke

[Verse 2]
I live life in the fast lane
Man I ain't got nuttin to lose, everything to gain
Either you with me or against me man ain't nuttin change
Nigga, you.. go against the grain, I'll make you.. walk with a cane
Now nigga now who you gon' blame when shit ain't the same
Nigga nobody hears your name, you got down wit a gang
O thirty-one blood, y'all niggas do your thang
You got two felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang
Y'all niggas wanna hang with niggas that filthy rich
They ain't even got to talk to take your bitch
One look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o
She seen them TVs and them big old rims, holmes
Ayo the bitch useta bring you dough used to be your bottom ho
Now your paper comin' slow, she feel like she had to go
Roll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers
Politic with the willies the real shot callers

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I got one life to live, follow that light that keeps on guidin me
Haters tryin me, hoes is a-bidein me, media ride me
King of the Underground so the streets is steady hiding me
Representin sure tasters, the yay' keep takin pride in me
Streets Deciple slide-in me, status reports the badest
You caught walk in the black top wit fat rocks and had his newport
I can't stay away like Too $hort, I gots to break a bastards back
Tore em up, get lem ready to port, put 'em on the master track
I blast the facts the life in the grill, gorilla pimpin
If I have to mack ya wife then I will, it's me and 50 Cent
My nigga, live in trife, and thats real, talkin shit on us
Thats like pullin out a knife and dont kill, that's on the Trill
I'm on for million wit your pit, in the clit that shit true
I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you
Without you even knowing got you strippin and even hoeing
You don't wanna let the pro in the door, this what we showin

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now it's time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine, bitch

[Outro]
Runnin from pimpin, bitch you need to run to some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on ho
You still ain't figured out what a ho supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucka here, huh bitch?
How you gunna catch some dates lookin like that ho?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin bitch!



[Hook: 50 Cent (Kidd Kidd)]
Niggas be schemin', fiendin'
To cut your jooks, take off the hook
I come through there, look how they look
I'm ridin' leanin', they dreamin'
They do me dirty if they could
I'm lookin' like I wish you would (Try me, go 'head, try me)
Niggas be schemin', dreamin' (Try me have you hooked to I-V)
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
Mad niggas wan' do me dirty, I'm fresh out the tub
You move like a snail you deserve to catch a slug
Man I wake up huggin' my bitch
One with that extended clip, not the one that I'm with
If you all made man, then you know shit real
They got change on Lil Mike, I ain't trynna see him killed
I told 'em that's my cuz, I don't wanna see nothin' happen to him
Cause when I start spittin' at 'em, I ain't rappin to 'em
Now I'm jumpin' in that water like a diver
Six shot survivors, school of hard knock scholars
These niggas ain't riders, they hiders, they cowards
I feel like 50, hold power of a dollar
I told my nigga give me one of them bullet-proof trucks
I want you dumb enough to try and shoot it up
I'm lookin' at the nigga lettin' off
Wait until you finish the clip, laugh then pulled off

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
It sounds like a nightmare, I graduated from fightin'
Play the projects faster than the 32 man indictment
See my baby blue Ferrari make 'em feel like the virus
In they stomach, I keep it one hundred, I make 'em vomit
I got a code name for straps, sacks in the trumpet
I get to blowin', the ears will ring for days when I dump it
My bullet wounds call 'em beauty marks
And my ho we don't talk to narcs
So the first 48 the clock tickin', the plot thickens
The charge, cocaine possession, I'm creepin' with a firearm
The D's don't even wanna see me, with a firearm
Before I go back again, I'mma let it off
They ain't got to pop first, fuck that I'mma set it off
I need a mental eval, somethin' wrong with my brainwaves
I'm rich as a motherfucker still ridin' with a AK
Picture me comin' through lettin' a nigga play me
When I got all this bread, bitch it's off with ya head, ASAP

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I had to be slippin' to let this clown hit me up
Now I gotta walk around with this shit bag for months
Now I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch or a nigga
Startin' to treat my own brothers like they just another nigga
My clique got smaller and my clips got bigger
Condom on my heart, motherfuck your feelings
They call me Superman see I ain't supposed to walk
Better watch how you talk or get popped like a cork, off

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
See they ain't real as they seem and they schemin'
They fiendin' and dreamin', they geekin' and creepin'
They hear tires screechin', infrared beamin'
Niggas head leakin', what the fuck was he thinkin'?
Sounds of police, momma signin' new leases
You know you got to relocate her when you beefin'
I guess you're here for a real reason
Rah got hit like you got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

[Hook]



[Talking]
Ya'll niggas wanna get high, well we gonna get high then
This shit right here is dro, ya'll for sell baby
50 Cent uh, take it how you wanna take it nigga

[Verse 1]
Yo aiyyo, aiyyo, there is six different weeds in the spot, choose one
Some get addicted, some do it for fun
Boy my hoes are clean, just like my guns
And I keep them in a safe place, just like my funds
I keep all my big bills, give my wifey the ones
Frontin' and I'll clap your ass and leave you for dead son
Niggas who know me, know how I get down, I'm fresh out the pound
NYPD quick to flip, get on some New York undercover shit
Fuck wit dogs you ain't familiar wit, and get bit
Niggas scripted through the hit, for some paper and shit
It's all about the cash, keep it in a stash
Some niggas talk shit wit they ass, I see through them like glass
Popo lookin' for me, for some shit I did in the past
If you don't like me at first, I'm gonna grow on you like a rash
This rap shit, I got it in smash, I'm built to last
Feel the wrath, I bust that ass, sit back and laugh (haha)

[Hook: repeat 2X]
You don't have to respect a nigga, but respect his cash
Cause for the money, niggas will murder that ass
I came up fast, I watched a lot of gats blast
The power of the dollar (the cash, the cash)

[Verse 2]
Nigga don't you ever forget, I call the shots
I run the spots, extort your pops, flossin' drops
I'm livin' off experience like Lox; I'm hot
Check what I got, shorty got knocked
Comin' up out the capsule spot
On the uptown block, he couldn't run from the cops
So my man got shot
In a jet black Brasada, across the street from his mom's crib on his block
I told him get them niggas that cash, they murdered that ass
Niggas told 'em slow down, he was movin' too fast
Heard the shot, went through his face after the glass, he crashed
Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low fast
The kid who had it done was a crude fella
Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella
We ain't know them, but now we know better
Not to fuck with his cheddar, his man pack a beretta
He won't hesitate to squeeze that, over that green back
Believe that, now niggas know that he's back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't got a worry in the world, if it's beef, don't sing it, bring it
Parents warn their kids, about people like me
I'm out of order, I turn your only daughter, into a transporter
Before I die, I'm gonna see more blow than Rich Porter (woo)
50 Cent, don't get it fucked up from Queens, not Fort Greene
Let it go back to Smith, I dissect it
I check and correct it, flow perfected
I make shit hectic, I wreck shit, nigga check it
If you ain't tryin' to feel the flames from the blast
Respect a nigga cash
My smile will rock niggas to sleep, pack heat
Fuck the police, handle beef on the street
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 9 with 2 MM's
If your man want to get involved, I'll bring it to him
Niggas been wantin' me dead, I'm still here kid
They send their dogs to come get me
They wet shit, but they ain't hit me
Word in the hood is 50, shifty
Niggas they don't want to go against me
Cause they know I hunt your ass alive

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
Unh, yeah..I like the way this feel right here
Yo...turn me up in the head phones just a lil' bit
Yeah..

[50 Cent + (Lloyd Banks)]
There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love
(Except loyalty and love, between thugs)
For you, I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip
(For you, I walk up close and lay a nigga's kid)
For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this my way I show, my love for you
(Nigga for you, I get the coke, I'ma turn it into cash)
For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
(For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
Cause with a record like yours dogg, you ain't stayin' upstate)
Nigga for you, I kill a whole God damn crew (Why?)
Cause I know you'd do the same thing too...haha
I ride, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a Thug like me?

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)
Nigga, you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)

[50 Cent + (Lloyd Banks)]
(Nigga, I'm the stem, you the crack
I'm the clip, you the gat
I'm the Glock, you the mac
I'm the artist, you the trap
I'm a pen, you the pad
I'm the Dutch, you the bag
I'm the knife, you the stab
I'm the driver, you the Jag)
I'm the ice, you the bezel
I'm grimy, you ghetto
I'm the bow, you the arrow
I'm the shell, you the barrel
I'm a pimp, you a player
I'm dope, you the hustler
I'm a nine, quiet me down, you the muffler

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
You can catch me in public housing, wit' bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains, bundled up to ski
Since, time is money, I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You seen the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice, I'm seeing' shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind, I wear the same thing tomorrow
When you grind, it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hide sixteen
Well my flow's like a ho that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad cause they see me in Cancun bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the 'hood my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still livin' like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice, I'm called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin' on cris', you sippin' backwash man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars, in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat...wha



Trackmasters, 99 shit
Huh uh, huh uh, yea

[Hook]
Slow dough, is better than no dough (fa sho)
Get caught talking to popo (what you say to him son?)
They hit you with the fofo (blaow, that's right)
My niggas is loco (loco)
Yo to diss me that's a no-no (no-no)
Y'all niggas is so-so (so-so)
That's why you ain't got no dough (broke ass niggas)

Put me through any test I bet ya I'll pass cause I'm a cheater
Broke niggas, smoke niggas, rich niggas smoke Cohiba's
My team been puffing cheeba and packing heaters
Since the days of shell toe Adidas And ain't shit come between us
Look I'm winning now and I'mma keep on winning
I see with you ain't nothing changed same gators same linen
Fuck the don shit, nigga I'm an armed convict I live wild
Beat cases before a trial grand jury style I'm foul
You wondering why I don't smile I'm schemeing to stick you up now
Son I be the first to blast the gun, the last to run
While you hit the pavement son I mash you, ugh
If you don't know you better go and ask someone
50 Cent is my symbol and my name
Symbolizing the change that I'm bringing to this game
Things'll never be the same (never the same baby)

[Hook]

Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
Like I won't grab the Glock and run up in your spot
Six double O drop I'll put two in your knot
And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you've got
Here I stand on the alley on Guy Brew same spot where Ra got shot
The block's hot warrant squad flashing my mug shot
Everybody know I'm loco, move on po po, blast the fo fo
Roll dolo rock solo, I should be OT on the low yo
Park the 6 and push the Volvo
I hear they go cuckoo when they puff Co Co
I sell Yayo the price up and down like yo-yo
But keep that on the low though, nobody's supposed to know, yo
I make 16 hundred off of every O yo
Fucking with the cash flow that'll get you blast yo
Ha Ha Ha I always get the last laugh yo

[Hook]

I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for rec
While you niggas race neck to neck
While niggas who live from check to check
I ain't even going to front I ain't working with a full deck
Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat
As soon as I start dreaming I'm right back on the street
Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me
Gotta be, fucked up in the head and smoking hemee
Believe me if you thought like me you could be me
But you ain't been through what I been through and this shit ain't that easy

[Hook]



[Intro]
I'm on parole, I used to be on probation
I'm with my gun, I get full coporation
I tell you "Take it off" no hesitation
Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's going down
Don't play with me, I don't have patience
My head achin', and I need my medication
Niggas be hatin', they don't know what they facing
Nigga you play around, I lay you down, that's how it's going down
I be in court throwing signs like I'm a mason
Nigga witness against me, I'mma erase 'em
If they try to run away, I'm gon' chase 'em
Now or at the town, and I'mma lay 'em down
That's how it's goin' down

[Hook]
Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, some deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down

[Verse 1]
Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slipping, then get hit with like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feeling
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villain
I play the bar with eight bottles all night getting right
Teaching the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on my wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga scheming, what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hoes confused
On the track ready to choose, like "Daddy, we want you"
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York
That's how we get down

[Hook]
Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, some deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down

[Verse 2]
In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get your ass hit
I don't know why niggas like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should hear they be saying man "50 be flipping"
"Shot my man over seven grams, that nigga be tripping"
I know death is promised, I don't fear getting murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with the pump
You can have it how you want, but I know you like my style
Uh-huh, you like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
Take this pack, pump these pieces, that's how we get down

[Hook]
Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, some deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down



Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news
Tony Yayo in the house, bad news
50 cent in the house, bad news whenever 50 around it's bad news
Trey pound's in the house, bad news

[Lloyd Banks]
I think little man mad cause I'm flossin' bad
I ain't a wrestler, but I'll put your bitch the Boston crab
I talk money cause it costs to brag
Round here bitches walk around wit the hair that the horses had
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch
Y'all sweet like ninety-nine bananas
That's why I got ninety-nine niggas wit ninety-nine hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I'm just a playa that found out what the coaches know
So I'mma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y'all both should know
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go
Shit I been hated since the fifth grade
That's why my best friend's a the tre pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade

[Hook]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Banks' back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Tony's back at it again)

[Tony Yayo]
Rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks
See where they rest at and lay with their peeps
Now you got the drop, know their daily routine
So the second rule please leave the crime scene clean
Third rule pick a day, fourth rule pick a time
Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the tenth rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe-tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

[Hook]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

[50 Cent]
Don't go against me I'll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level's high nigga can't tell
Lickin my lips at ya bitch like I'm LL
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like a nigga in the bookings that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, "Cent got money," and I got shot
You put pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggas say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the shepherd and watch the sheep scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, know not to play wit my check
I come through and put my knife on that vein in ya neck (YEAH!)

[Hook]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

[Eminem]
Ayo Fif, I was thinking
You should go back to doing the shit you used to do

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Murder them, murder them, if I let them demonstrate I murder them
Niggas be fronting, word up it's stunting til they heard up
Their semi talk, I let that buck, I had these niggas running hard
I pull a nigga skirt up, and have him kicking dirt up
I get a nigga hit a nigga, back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrants
Seein' through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand close to the homie you wanna die with
Flames come out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
I'm talking like the feds ain't listening
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishing in
I get it nigga if you want it
Better ask niggas out me I be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot, out the cannon

[Hook: 50 Cent]
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to back put the work in
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to backroom workin'

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
You know I got the strap on me, bar holding that for me
I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though
100 9 millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggas drop like domino
Run for your life puta, si, vamonos
I was taught to see my crew a long time ago
Walk around with cocaine, yeah even my mama know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Made 4 hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cindy Lauper bitch, time after time
A nigga shine, like a nickel 9
I been talking to the man in the mirror
Nigga so ass, they be shaking like Shakira
It seems like my vision's getting clearer
See me coming with the hammer out, death is getting near you
It's funny how niggas never hear you
Till you run down on them, gun down on them

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, starting to feel like the old me

[Intro]
Aight, check this shit out
Y'all niggas gon' stay in the car
Imma go and handle this shit
Gimme ten minutes, If I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so... word up
Aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
This is what y'all niggas is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram?


[Verse 1]
Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I can go Uptown and get this shit 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
Got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some "get this money" shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DEA I sold dope in VA
My coupe stay in Queens but the plates read VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it ain't hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on consignment
(Hey, times is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'mma kill Guiliani
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

[Hook]
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man


[Outro]
Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
I'm bout my money man, I'm bout my money man



[Intro]
Cee-lo, we know
I'm sitting on leather, I'm a winner
If I crap out the strap out
Cause I snap right back to the beginning, nigga

[Hook]
You know I will let it pop
Front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You know, you think you ill, but you not
You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot

[Verse 1]
I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy, if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Wanna party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me, a nigga got bread
I'm big money, big business, I love it
For the bad bitches with big asses and the budget
I'm the boss, until you know shit is going how it got to go
I don't want talk tonight, I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spend no expense
First I'm happy then she happy then she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give a bitch a buck
Flip and catch an attitude like ''bitch, what the fuck
You want from a nigga, huh? You fucking up a nigga, huh?'
Look, girl, you know you sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done
Don't care about the set you claim, motherfuck the gang you bang
I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums
That party get the popping then we beefing and we shooting
Let's party like it's 1999
Flat top Gazelle, the swag going back in time
I got it locked, they can't ignore it
Man, nigga, know some bullshit I'm all for it
Heroin Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean, spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking ''damn, why me?''
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe, they know a nigga live
I let it off inside and outside
The club rocking, it's on tonight
Them bottles popping, we getting right

[Hook]



[Intro: 50 Cent]

Lame niggas be quiet, you in the presence of a real nigga

Lame niggas be quiet, you in the real nigga’s presence

And if you don’t know I go by Tity two necklace

[50 Cent]
Nigga that cocaine that I’m flippin' (yeah), wood-wood grain when I’m dippin' (grrrr)

[2 Chainz]

My gat loud, I back out and click clack pow pow
Court dates, still trial, my rep is a reptile
Now later, alligators, I step on a work like a step child (whoo)
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I’m down, her phone off so don’t dial

[50 Cent]
That-that pyrex in my kitchen, rich niggas still bitchin'
Them GDs and them vicelords or that gangsta shit I be kickin'
Who Blood now? Who Crippin?, who pussy? Tell me who snitchin'?
I got a firearm to fire on for whoever done let that bitch in (bitch in)
These niggas don’t live by the codes then cut in and fucked up the game
Throw your sets up if you don’t give a fuck, it’s 50 and 2 Chainz
Got the hood back poppin’, I dance to this, I buy the whole bar, nigga you can drank to this
Get the bottles poppin’ while the hoes watchin’ and damn I love this gangsta shit

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
(Yeah... that's what I'm talkin' 'bout)

[Hook]

My swag on a hundred, yeah that fly shit I want it quick
I’m on it
I’m always on point, man I make niggas so sick
[Verse 1]
I’m chin chillin, crystal spillin’
Hip hop’s villain cause I’m making a killin’
Niggas wanna try me, I’m strapped with the lammy
If Jay’s Illuminati, what am I, am I Bugatti?
Lodi Dodi, we like to party
Big 4 in the morning, go outside and catch a body
I ball full time nigga this is not a hobby
If you don’t know about me, better ask somebody
Yeah, I’m grimey, my wrist so shiny
My Audemars, I blew a mil, I’m back to making money
My swag make her want me, why else would she be on me
I bet she hardly want me? I think she want to blow
Lick me like a lolly, lick me like a lolly
Her ass ain't all that but her tits like Dolly’s
Give me that punani, give me that punani
Now this is motivation make me want more money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got it, black card in my wallet
Find me on locations with model bitches are spotted
Fly shit I rock it, Tom Ford, exotic
Bitches on my dick now that I moved up out the projects
One for the money, two for the show
I’m ghetto like a mothafucka, what you didn’t know?
Took threes for my niggas gettin’ 8 hundred an O
Kush burn slow, I burn dough
And sip Merlot like I’m on furlow
Fresh up out the pen, I’m back at it again
Thumpin’ like the system in my new big body Benz
Look I’ma Fat Joe, my neck glow
The lights hit the ice, its a special effects show
Tinkle twinkle little star, no one here knows who you are
Me I’m so big, notorious you dig
The paper’s no problem when you're fucking with the kid



[Intro: 50 Cent]
What y'all know about this fab shit, huh?
TE, baby, come on, Trackmasters

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Look we can shop together, mama, his and hers
Fifth Ave. shit, baby, Fendi furs
I ain't tight with the chips, girl, I'm down to splurge
If it's ice you like I'll light up your life
VS2 Clarity, aight?
I play the block, I ain't the type to punch a clock
I'm the type to put the pedal to the floor in the drop
I live life in the fast lane, I mix dro wit hash
Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head full of bullshit a lot
I gave her jewels that I caught of a jux
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty, every now and then she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon' write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want, a thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thugged out no good baby

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Ayo, I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special
Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you
When I met you it was Guess and Gap, now it's Gucci and Prada
Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo, when shorty say she hate me you know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar that mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip, threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some hominy grits
That's how she on it, when I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD
You know me, I let her do her thing, son
I say what I'm feeling, niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy like a staircase in your building
What?

[Hook]

[Outro: Beyonce]
A thug is what I want and a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand how my baby laces me
A thug is what I want and a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand and I think it's jealousy

[Hook]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down

[Verse 1]
Through every altercation
I put no one above you, mm-mm I love you
They shook up when we jux 'em, you see how they be looking
It's frightening like lightning, you crack off, they start booking
It's beef until I get out in broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illing and when she get to killing
Now my baby she precious, I warn you not to test us
I aim her at your head, nigga, motherfuck the vests
I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I got her on me
I'm riding with her on cocked, Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow, twist the indo, smoke it up, it's fundamental
You can't get to her, poke 'em up when we get intimate
That's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When niggas get to tripping
I need you by my side, yeah, so they can't catch me slipping
I take you out shopping, get you clean, get it popping
Use my finger, get ya hot, girl, I know your spot, yeah
I love you if you love me back, you never jam when I react
To sucker shit when they get hit and we take off If you get tossed
I'll be back, I want you so I'll be back
I'll never change, I be the same, a nigga stunt, I let it rain
I'm off the chain, I'm all in, mane
I'll hit you up, you think I'm playing, I be strapped
Go 'head fuck around, I be strapped
24/7 I'm back holding, mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

[Hook]

[Intro]
You ain't strong enough, nigga, you sweet
You probably go against me, and win
I oughta kiss you, you'd probably like that
But you don't stand a chance, nigga
Fucking faggot

[Verse 1]
I do more than talk that, I mu'fuckin walk that
Blue Yankee cap back, fuck around get clapped at
I sleep with the stainless, I walk with the stainless
Man, everybody know about 50, I'm famous
New York, New York, I run New York
Ask Dread at the weed spot, I come through in the mean drop
In different boroughs I have different moments
On different days niggas know how I'm on it
I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga
I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
I'm a hustler don't get no bigger
Queens, Southside 'til they bury me
BX, two TEC's, flames out the nozzles
R1 One wheel, Christian Dior goggles
Spare with me, start some shit, send the shooters out
Come out the club, we out front with the Ruger's out
Nah, ain't no sense to talking peace, my brother
That beef will probably send your monkey ass to see Allah

[Hook]
These niggas ain't strong enough
Their money ain't long enough
When they bump heads with me
They find out the guns do bust
We getting paper, in God we trust
These sucka ass niggas
These niggas ain't strong enough
Their money ain't long enough
When they bump heads with me
They find out the guns do bust
We getting paper, in God we trust
Suck on this, nigga

[Verse 2]
When I said I'll kill ya, I'll kill ya, as a kid I wasn't kidding then
Special ED kid in the back on Ritalin
Crib all fucked up, hooptie all fucked up
Pockets all fucked up, now nigga, what's up?
I'm rich now, niggas know about my dividends
Look at the Robb Report, check out what I'm living in
Fuck a spot now, I'm 'bout to buy a yacht now
Crib the size of the New York City block now
Okay okay, try me and get shot down
I'm like a zebra, I got so many stripes
I'm the fucking general, I run my clique right
It was five of us, all of us millionaires
Now one's a fucking junkie, and one's a fucking queer
Now it's three of us, that's the way we started
They call me crazy, cold-blooded and black-hearted
I don't play no games, niggas beg for mercy
Then we "T.O.S.", put that ass to rest

[Hook]



[Intro: 50 Cent] (x2)
Yeah
I am NY, no lie

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
They say they do it, like I do it with no mask on
Nigga, get the fuck outta line, you getting blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose
I’ll stomp ya fucking head til it’s under the surface
Now I need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
‘Fore I put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
These niggas ain't made of the same shit I’m made of
I dump a clip for my man if he needs a favour
I let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
And he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
They don’t understand I was raised by the vultures
Still laughing like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
Call grandmami "mommy" cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missin’ since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playin’ games with the orphan
They know my pedigree test me I’mma off ‘em

[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)
Stop the bloodclot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry ya eye
Don’t cry, dry ya eye

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
That first body drop, we just getting started, death come in three’s
Ar15, M16, semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade enter flesh it’s an emergency
Ya love leak, heart open call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the alter
See, I’m at an advantage I don’t care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin’ when then patience start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds know, now a nigga half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened we’re all gonna die
You can say a prayer when I’m coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Stop the bloodclot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry ya eye
Don’t cry, dry ya eye



[Verse 1]
It ain't good to do good in front of niggas in the hood, right?
It ain't good to do good in front of niggas in the hood, right?
Everybody know that
Doing good in front of niggas in the hood cause problems
Treys, trey pounds, and four-fours solve em (you ain't lying!)
I hate when hoes get on some loudmouth shit
Your man gangster? Me too -- go on, get him, bitch!
I just bought a new toast to spit
Next nigga getting gully getting laid out quick
Wherever ribs is touching, niggas is getting hurt
Cause a broke nigga always down to put in work
Don't run up on me -- I don't know you, nigga
So what you bought my CD? I don't owe you, nigga
I know you love the way the Audi's beat bumps
Got your license plate rattling all over your trunk
I confuse these chumps with my style, dog
I'm from Queens, but I'm motherfucking B.K. hard
I sound like I move bricks Uptown
But like a thug from the Bronx, I stay with the four pound
Shook nigga -- I'm a Guinness Book nigga

[Hook]
We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your fucking wig split down here
Don't go repping where you come from too much around here
You can get your fucking cap peeled -- Queens, nigga!

We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your fucking wig split down here
Don't go repping where you come from too much around here
You can get your fucking cap peeled -- Brooklyn!

[Verse 2]
If I can't get my gun in the club, why would I come in the club?
So niggas I done stuck up could cut me the fuck up?
Nah, I'm outside to jump off when they finished, G
Four deep, strapped with all kinds of heat
Niggas think they want beef; they don't want beef
They find out when somebody they love laying in the street
When you rap, you keep it gangsta, dog -- it's all good
But don't go popping that shit in my old hood
Where I'm from, a young boy'll come and try you, nigga
Shells'll have you feeling like you on fire, nigga
If you thinking we thirsty, cuz, you right
We looking at your watch and chain like that's a S-type
Promoters saying, "Don't play 50 in the club
Last time he came on, niggas tore shit up"
What! I don't know where you from and I don't care
But, nigga, we don't play that pussy shit around here

[Hook]
We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your fucking wig split down here
Don't go repping where you come from too much around here
You can get your fucking cap peeled -- Harlem, nigga!

We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your fucking wig split down here
Don't go repping where you come from too much around here
You can get your fucking cap peeled -- BX!

[Verse 3]
The only Spanish I know is, "Go on your guita la boca, puta"
"No inglés, no inglés", motherfuckers'll shoot ya
The Latin Kings don't like me, I don't care
We don't talk that "Mira, mira" bullshit around here
Man, I done did so much dirt in the hood
Niggas heard I got shot, they was all saying, "Good!"
Fuck y'all, y'all ain't got to like me
I get knocked, y'all niggas ain't got to write me
I'm on the same bullshit I been on
It's the same bullshit y'all niggas need to get on
Y'all shit sound too commercial
Come cruising through the hood, motherfuckers'll hurt you
You should know where and where not to flash jewels
Cause nigga's run up on y'all fools and flash tools
They want the money, the watch, and your tennis shoes
I ain't gotta tell you not to move -- you know the rules

[Hook]
We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your fucking wig split down here
Don't go repping where you come from too much around here
You can get your fucking cap peeled -- Staten Island!

The drama, I'm with it, I get biz, you get it
I breezed on that shiddit, I split your widdig
That's why a nigga's bidded, I can't forget it
I said I didn't do it, witnesses said I did it
I'm fresh out on bail, my Benz is all kitted
Five TV's, my rims is so sidick
I cruise through, your bitch just fell in love with it
Baby, come in, girl, I want to give it to you
Once I'm in, it's on, I'm a freak with it
Money comes with it, hot shit, I spit it
G Unit kidicks, blue New York fitted
Shorty, want to cut, oh, yeah, I'm with it
She comes to my hotel room, she know she's gone get it
Its exercise, my homie, he's been waiting, he's next in line

[Hook]

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
People always talking about my reputation
I don't love them, I don't need them
I don't love them, I don't need them
I don't love them
I don't care what she do with him, it's all good with me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
They can't do it how I do it, I'm number one, I knew it
I do, I do my thing and gangsters bop to it
It's hit after hit, damn, I'm on a roll
I'm like James Brown now, man, I've got soul
No, I ain't pimping, hell, yeah, I've got hoes
I was born to do this, when I breathe I make a killing
Think I'm bullshitting, my money's touching the ceiling
Ain't buying condos, I'm buying the whole building
I'm pissing on grown women, R Kelly do it to children
You bet against me, boy, I'mma hurt your feelings
Because over and over, I'mma keep on winning
My Rolls Royce's tinted, your Phantom's rented
That's why we never ever ever ever see you with it
Man, everybody knows, like everywhere I go
When 50 in the club, shit just goes out of control
You can blame it on Em, or blame it on Dre, okay?

[Hook]

Your favorite bad guy's gone, The Joker's dead
So for now 'til forever you're stuck with the kid
I ain't supposed to be a boss, I'm supposed to be an enforcer
I'm supposed to hold a gun, not be stuck in an office
Michael pimped me? I was in the passenger seat
We was comfortable with me 'round, cause I blast my heat
94' I was trying to catch Mason for bricks raw
Charlie fucked up the jux, they took no orders little boy, stretch
The cocaine, I go hard when the drought come
When the straps come out, son, niggas know the outcome
Lay low, stay low, you may see Jesus
You hit with a stray, yo, for no fucking reason
You praying for a Benz, it's a blessing you breathing
It's a miracle that God gave me this TEC, now I'm eating
Cop it, chop it, profit, it's all for sale
Cocaine, candy rain, I'm so for real, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the dope-man, coke-man, smoke-man, whatever-man
The X-man, TEC-man, you better respect, man
Get the green, triple beam, inf' beam, murder scheme
Fiend, morphine, dream, codeine, more lean
Gun pop, one shot, body drop, it wasn't me
Tell the cops it wasn't me, you saw me right? It wasn't me
It's not my M.O., see me I make it stretch
Get in the way I put a body on my TEC
Call me crazy, I die for what I stand for
I have ammo flying out the Lambo
Like Commando, nah, like Rambo
I keep my cool as long as the fucking grams go
Wooptee-woo, I'm a Chef like Rae

Trying to blow selling blow, I'm who you fuck with, man
I got Spiderman high, I made Batman fly
Your favorite hero took a hit, now here you try
I don't care if it's a sin, I don't care if you're ten
Look around kid, it's a cold world we're in
If you ask me my offer is extremely handsome
A little Charlie, Marley, a little bit of Manson
Yeah, me falling off is really far fetched
I turn a little to a lot, I make it stretch
In come the Franklin's then come the Benji's
Fiends by the crackhouse, dirty and dingy, yeah

[Hook]



[Intro 50 Cent]
Yeah, uhuh, let's take 'em there, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sonny did ten years in the fed joint, he half way out
He ain't home, his ass in a halfway house
Correctional facilities don't correct shit
Cause the first thing he asked is who gotta get hit
A shoot out in 89' fucked up how he walk
He a grimey ass nigga, you should hear how he talk
Should shoot the shepard in the head and da sheep ill scatter
Let niggas talk cause action is all that matters
I asked about Barnes he sucked his teeth and said he was soft
Said the boys up in Otisville was breakin him off
Can you picture him in the yard, niggas yokin him up
Treatin him like a pin cushion, pokin him up
He came home actin like he hard as fuck
Must want a first class ticket to see god Uh huh
He stick his chest out tellin' niggas he don't back down
Wait until he find out Sonny’s back 'round

[Hook x2]
Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, that somethin gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Without a strap, and you gon getcha ass layed down

[Verse 2]
My nigga Los comin home soon he up there in Fort Dix
It's on when he come home cause he can get 'nuff bricks
I was young he taught me not to run, I popped my gun par
You can ask Scarlata ??? and Amar
Them niggas used to hit banks back in the days
They embedded in my brain young crime does pay
New Cadillacs and Bonnevilles the very next day
I just look and learn, I ain't have much to say
Legs ill squeeze the life out you like a boa constrictor
Fuck a headlock, im talking bout extortion nigga
Apply pressure, its hot, get the fuck out the kitchen
When niggas pay you every Friday you ain't got to stick em
At the dice game if Ace roll a six it's no problem
But if he roll a ace he gon pull out and rob him
Losin, a little is alot, when niggas is starvin'
Man the drama in my hood is goin down regardless

[Hook x2]
Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, that somethin gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Without a strap, and you gon getcha ass layed down

[Verse 3]
Everbody know Education shot Jamal over short paper
He on the run you want a nigga hit son he'll take it
Heard Wise got shot up over some punk shit
In the club beefin' with niggas over some dumb bitch
They say Willy was caked up off them credit card scams
Started a pyramid, the nigga took the money and ran
Heard he was outta town ridin round in the pound
Chrome spinnin' 545 I no lie ask how
Out on VA, Hampton homecoming he cruise by
He run in to the niggas that he beat, he gon die
E must’ve caught a jooks the D's flashin' his mugshot
You know it's his M.O. to run up in them crack spots
His sister, she aight, big hips, lil waist, big tits
Pretty face, we fucked on the staircase
Lisa that’s my bitch she freak off with a nigga, shit
Man I gotta call that bitch

[Hook x2]
Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, that somethin gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Without a strap, and you gon getcha ass layed down



[Intro]
GGGGGGGG G-unit
50 Cent, Shady, Aftermath
The Dreamteam
We got to get the get well cards
Niggas is sick
Feel this
Motion picture shit
Hahaha!

[Verse / Freestyle]
Now don't think I won't hit you because I'm popular
I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya
Catch you slipping I'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya
You never had a hot gun on ya waist and blood on your shoe
Because a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
Homie, you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me, and I'm not like you
I'm like an animal wit it when I spit it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryin' to play me
One shot is not enough you need at least a Uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start to feeling woozy
I write my life, you write what you see in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me
I find my space at the top, I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spit shells to your convertible
Lotus you notice richer or poor
Hollow steel go through your door, this is war
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back
50 Cent, I know you like that, I know you like that



Yeah, Sha, you're ready, drop that, Ferrari F50 style baby
I'm a show them how I do it, G Unit

[Verse One]
I keep hearing niggers' is happy, the D's come, niggers' with guns
When I'm out on bail, riding with some new ones
Big got hit in that passenger seat
Pac got hit in that passenger seat
Now I'm riding around in that passenger seat
Come near the whip, I'm blasting my heat
It don't take long for my juvenile delinquent thinking to sink in
The consequences mean nothing, those semi auto's is busting
Crack selling, predicate villain, spit big words, but I can't spell them
That'll keep your punk ass from telling
That I got that nine and that four four, the H2 on double four's
Bulletproof windows and doors, gangster, how about yours
'Southside' tatted on my back
My last gun shipment got the whole hood strapped
Now all I got is two three eighties' and a nine
Nigga, you can knock and tell the cops, but you're dying

[Hook] [x2]
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, you bitch, follow me

[Verse Two]
I used to chill in the hood to support the fiends
But, now I'm eating caviare instead of pork and beans
I'm in the money green seven forty-five with seven shots in the four five
Y'all niggers' want to die
I've got a love affair with violence and guns
So this is for them gangsters', represent where you're from
When I got older, my heart turned colder
That's why the Mac react like a King Cobra
Now I'm jumping out of Rovers in Gucci loafers
Y'all niggers' want to stun, I'll bury you cockroaches
Give me one year, in this industry
I'll buy enough guns to declare war on a small country

[Hook] [x2]
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, you bitch, follow me

[Verse Three]
Still walk around with the hammer boss, rope, and a cross
Hard times will make a little nigga hate Santa Claus
Your mountains is high, holding in Diana Ross
I'm like a two thousand and three banana Porsche
I don't got to hide sluts to get your ties cut
They on my dick because I make groupies set off a fire truck
My team in the cut, packing middle things
I've got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings
It's eight class karats in the border
I poke holes in plastic to avoid a vaginal disorder
I'm a savage on your daughter, she ain't in the college dorm
Then I guess I'm squirting on the cabin that you bought her
I'm a heavy weed smoker so the average is a quarter
Brown coloured from shit he established in the water
You got Banks on your jersey, you're part of my fanbase
Just because you pour syrup on shit, don't make it pancakes

[Hook] [x2]
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, you bitch, follow Me



[Intro: 50 Cent]
New York City, you are now rocking with 50 Cent
Are you ready? -- I said are you ready?
See, you with me, nigga? Drop that
Paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop
G-Unit -- something new

[Intro]
I'm not that nigga in your video
I'm not a trick, I don't love the hoes
And niggas know I be on the low
When I gets my dough and I twist my dro
I'm not that nigga that you think you know
I walk around with a big fo-fo
You front on me I'm gon' get at you, dawg
I be right at your crib waiting at your door
(What up 50!)

[Verse 1]
Coming up I ain't have much, I wanted a lot
I had paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop
So you know I had to make something out of nothing
Like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumping
Hustled hard, at nineteen I bought a Benz, I did
The older niggas really wasn't feeling the kid
Trying to find where I live so they could run in my crib
But you can't hustle a hustler, I peeped it and slid
Back then niggas used to call me Boo
In six months I sold a million gold tops on Guy Brewer
Country came around, he's into clapping and
Country left, same shit started happening
Like, "He shot Rob for some ends, Rob shot Joe over some skins
Cory shot you and we was friends, money turned boys into men"
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again

[Interlude]
Naw, nigga, ain't nothing changed, nigga
Yeah, I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back

[Verse 2]
(Damn 50, good to see you back in the hood)
You see my cherry red SL, nigga -- I'm doing good
Sometimes I can't find the words to say how I feel
So I take a quote from Menace -- "look at the wheels"
I'm addicted to stunting now that I'm holding something
I got a trunk full of guns from VA today
(Oh, nigga, let me hold something?)
Nigga you high or something?
I don't play games, I'm bout my money, nigga -- buy something
I got a few 5ths, I got a few 9's
Here nigga take one, catch a jux and bring me mine

[Outro]
Yeah, don't ever say I don't do nothing for you, nigga
You know, don't say I didn't look out for you, knowhatImean?
But make sure, nigga, that you go catch some jux
When you come back you gonna have my paper for that thang thang, knowhatI'msayin?
I don't want it back nigga, don't try to use it then give it back to me
Cause I could see y'all niggas now running around saying
"50 getting all this rap money and he won't help us"
Sit tight, nigga, I'm coming, you know? New shit
All the shit I put out on the mixtapes is for the mixtapes
I got a million
Oh my God -- my shit is so hot right now; I'm in the zone



[Hook]
She made me want it, want it
On a late night, or in the morning, morning
I wanna be where she wanna be
She is the defenition of sexy to me
I'm finna push her upon me, upon me
Yeah let her know, that I want it, want it
She wanna be, where I wanna be
She is the defenition of Sexy to me

[Verse 1]
Seduction, I'm stuck when...
She get' that bad in her eyes
She walks the thick in her thighs
It's perfect, it's worth it
I do what I got to get it
I ain't trippin, shit I'm with it
I put it down, when I hit it
She'll be so happy she did it
I'll bet she never forget it
In bed, I'm like a wizard
Shawty exquisite she wanna visit over and over and over
Her body is a map, I'm the god
I'm just here to show her
How to get to that g-spot
Non stop, tic tac
Time fly, hella fun
No lie, oh ay
No I, can give her what she need
Slo-mo, high speed, xtc, triple D

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can hear us from the next room
When we go at it
I studied her addiction
She got a habit
She gotta have it
I'm always on my job
I work it nice and hard
I mean I work it how she want it
She my homie, lover and friend
Yeah she might just bring her other friend
Feel the rush, adrealine
That make a nigga's head spin
I say just keep it simple baby
We ain't gotta complicate it
If you want it and I want it
Maybe we should have it
Baby we got one live to live
It's precious the time we share
Now call me when you're in need
Baby girl i'll be there
For showing me, you can confide
I'm a rider. 24/7 yeah ready to ride

Got Dre callin' Shady sayin Em what's up?
We done came this far, we can't stop now
Em, 50 off the hook, he got to calm down
I guess I'm out of control, my mind, body and soul
Tell me I'm bein pimped and it's makin me sick
You know Em made that company over a billion dollars
And when he ain't around they sayin foul shit about him
Yeah we fucked up, we both don't know our pops
We both don't like the cops, we don't know when to stop
You know Kim is Shaniqua and Hailey is Marquise
D-12's G-Unit and we always in beef

Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know Oprah got In Da Club on her iPod
She don't want me on her show though I guess I'm too hard
She sat Kanye West down, and talked about his crash
But she don't wanna talk about the bullets in my ass
Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast
I hate it when a nigga get to countin my cash
Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan
Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on
I'm tryin to make a decision damn, leave me alone
I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot
It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock
Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my Glock
Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool
I'll have your kids tryin to be, crazy cool in school
Truth is they like me, more than they like you
They watch me and emulate, everything I do

[Hook]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I have days when I feel like everybody's against me
Sharpton ain't comin when the feds snatch 50
Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed
Right before the crackers come snatch my ass
I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap
Put Southside on the map, I did that
Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute
I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit
Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats
She said she didn't like rap until she met me
You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man
A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand

[Hook]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah

Smile for me! If I gotta go away to make you feel better
I'll go away! Ya know? I got what I came to get
My money right, ya nah mean I'm good don't worry 'bout me I'm good
Ya know? This is about you now, is it 'gon make you happy to see me gone?
Are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Are you just gonna forget about me? I meant nothin to you?
Is that what you sayin to me?
Cause ya breakin my heart...
Hahaha, I mean you're really breakin my heart



[Hook: 50 Cent]

I string em along on some acoustic guitar shit
Tell em park it in front of Neiman Marcus

Said we gon chill, where the weed at, the weed at?
Said you got a Spider, where them keys at? Them keys at?
Living on em, shitted on em ?
I'm hotter than the sauna, ? is under
Calm yourself before you get dealt with
Had the medics working on your pelvis
DOA there's nothing left to say
Went down like an hourglass
Paris 1st class regardless
Fake bitches, not responsive
Me, I'm in the streets rocking a piece, that's retarded
In the diamond district with Jacob
Making you, you little clones wanna save up

[Hook - 50 Cent]
We come from Queens where we are taught to handle
Beef on our own
You call up cops, we get it poppin
We be out with the chrome

Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Statan at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Yonkers at?

All my men is caped up, stingy with the snatch
Cause niggas get too attached
Sleep with the ratchet under the mattress
Natural: my cat got a 5 o'clock shadow
It don't matter cause niggas is still badder
You chicks is getting fucked
I'm on top, that's how I bop
Luxury every stop
Eat it or beat it, you should already know my friend
You're not needed: next nigga, remix
Word to everything with on G shit
Fuck with me, give me a reason
Feel something hot, change the whole season
For the greater good, make you face your demons
It's the loca, caramel mocha
Bitches is on their sofa, I'm taking over
You now rocking with the best mama
Bombshell hood hottie in the egg-shell Bughatti, oh!

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
(Queens will) ease on em, squeeze on em
We'll dump the .223's on em
Breeze on em, lit the trees on em
In the bandanna, make em think it's gang-related
We on that gritty shit, the city shit
New York New York
You come through on some pretty shit
Get outlined in chalk
I get busy, I get busy, I'm strapped now
I'm tryna say I want you motherfuckers to act out
I had that ass sprint towards the door when I back out
Don't do it, don't you do it, don't you do it
Don't make me step to you
Holy moly, rolly icy oyster perpetual
Diamonds blinking like hey, just take a look at it
I'm a regular bad man, they say I'm a mad man
Fuck a mask and gloves, I lay it on bare hands
We come from a war zone, them South side streets
Where anything and everything gets gunned to eat



"So tonight, I wanna talk to you about the relationship
Between money and peace.."
A lot of people say it's not about money, it's about peace!
It's about money...

You took my heart from me
I'll never be the same
Now killing won't be hard for me
Cause I can't feel a thing

Sunday morning, preacher in the pulpit
Kissed my nanna, I can't listen to this bullshit
It's all good til they ask me for an offering
All we got is pain, so that's all I can offer him
My mama cold, she put me in this cold world
Left me, what I got to protect me?
Oh, I got a 9, yeah I got a 9!
And all this ambition, bitch I'm on the grind
Sky's the limit, 2 for 5's the gimmick
You line something up, I tie something up
They run up out that crib with that money, nigga what
School of hard knocks, I'm ahead of my class
With no hesitation put a hole in your ass
See, no it's never my fault when I fuck up
I knock your ass out, to wake you the fuck up
Brass knuckles and my knife: now tell me wassup

[Hook]

I made it to a half a mansion, shit I thought I made it
Hood bitches on a nigga, yeah all on a nigga
The D's his the door with the batter ram
I'm standing by the toilet that's broke, tryna flush this shit
Bizzy was my nigga started fucking with that cracker shit
Beat me out my money, nigga ran off with my Mack key ??
I was down, he kicked me when I'm down
When I think about this kid, it fucks my head up right now
You know the same niggas that got me shot, killed your brother
And you ain't never did shit about that, motherfucker
When niggas was beefing with you, I shot that park up
Now I'm thinking about the occasions, my gun blazing
You got me feeling like a sucker B

You took my heart from me
(Son, I don't give a fuck son we can back right now)
I'll never be the same
(Niggas gonna try and front on me and be right there?)
Now killing won't be hard for me
(Nah, nah, I'm putting them niggas on house arrest)
Cause I can't feel a thing

I'mma go and I'mma go back, fuck that
I'mma stay on them niggas 'til they can feel me breathing on them
You, you look at these fake ass niggas
They think cause they saying some fake shit in music, that the shit I be saying ain't real
All you gotta do is ask niggas, they tell you about me
They dont say Fifty though they say Boo Boo
Uh uh
Find out
Find out if I let it go

Man turn this shit off



[Hook]
This is hip hop, it go clip pop

Papa said we bang bang boogie, we get' em oh goodie
Keep the hoodie when you're fucking with me, me, me

[Verse 1]
Now what you hear is not a test
I said it's not a test, nigga, it's not a test
Got my Teflon on wrapped around my chest
I do it the best, ya heard, I do it the best
Tuck the nine by my spine all the time
Stunt when I want a dead nigga, fuck with mine
My neck and my ear get to flicking like a strobe
My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa
I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne
In the club wilding out over Henny and Patron
Me I'm in the zone, yeah me I'm in the zone
It's bottle after bottle til G-stacks are blown
Shawty in my ear like ''please take me home''
Before the next song, come on dawg, we gone
Off to the hotel, motel, the Holiday Inn
She said ''if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that
I would've brought my friend'' uh huh huh huh huh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm so raw, yeah, I'm so raw
Me I'm so ghetto, I'm oh so hardcore

Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more
They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy
I'm ecstasy, I'm the ultimate trip
I have ya in the morning like a dope fiend sick
Now feel the rush, I'm like pure cocaine
I have the whole night club going insane
No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change
I will let it rain, push me, I let it rain
I do this shit myself, lawyer money ain't a thang
The unit is the gang, the yin and the yang
We went from poor to rich, now look we the shit
You best control your bitch or she'll be in the six
Uh huh huh huh huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm fresh to death, I'm rocking the vest
I'm strapped moving 'round with the heat

That's why my name ring bells in the street
I put that work in, yeah yeah

I put that work in, yeah yeah

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Now if I give you all of me, what'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me, got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love, now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me, tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[Verse 1]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire, mama, make it all simple
Flashback '03, paparazzi flashing flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
Mwah - it just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you, but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they liar-liar-liars
You fuck 'em they, get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earning
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Life is short, baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferrari horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hating on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a lifer that get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me is to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

[Hook]

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
What you gonna give me back?
You're gonna make me fall in love
What you gon' give me, what you gon' give me, what you gon' give me



[Verse 1 - Nas]
Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin' we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin' wit da old time click
Holdin' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk
How it use to be, early morn, pumpin' in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin' us
The D's in the marked vans and cabs
In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin' out young lady's and make them make thotties
Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out
Thug babies, famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
It's in the air of New York
So everybody'll pick em up, kissin em up
Treatin' them like they own, in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life, it's kinda deep how we end out

[Hook]
Yo them niggas that wanted beef before
Don't want no beef no mo
Now that they know who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!!
Who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!! (repeat)

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Ya'll niggas better sober up before ya'll speak to me, don't come at me high
Last rapper that raised his voice to me, got jabbed in da eye
Now if I say I'm gone get you, I'mma get ya
On da strength of da inf, from long range I can hit ya
You find out them niggas who wit ya ain't even wit ya
After da gem stars split ya, you need an MD to stitch ya
Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin' me for ten cents to got hit ya
Look my name up in the law book, Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin'
Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nickname gats
Got a tech I call Tina, a nine I name Nina
Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her
This QB shit, bout to take me to da next level
Next crib, next Benz, next bitch, next bezel
It's that real

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bravehearts]
[Millennium Thug]
Yo, aiyyo, who da fuck wanna war
I got a four four, pierce ya'll niggas jaw
You see me thugged out, iced out, Guinness Stout
Hopin' out the Range wit da gun out
Smack your man down, you ran off
I was gonna hit him with two, I left some for you
I put four, QB rugged and raw
I got somethin' for these rap cats, fish held back gats
Scope wit a beam on it, loc put your cream on it
Shine don't scheme on it, I make your dream about it
Forever, whatever whatever get gully
Shots thru your leather and clothe, With your skelly off
Break ya'll clowns off
Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket, I don't give a fuck who you be
Millennium Thug, now who da fuck want it with me

[Horse]
I mastered the art of slap boxin' niggas in da dark
QB's big man, Horse of the Bravehearts
I'm da Sasquash of rap, collector of gats
Testin' macks at your bulletproof vests and hats

[Jungle]
How bout that, guns bust off, I bust back
When trucks backfire, I bust back
How bout that, stomp a muhfuckin' rib out ur back
Ya'll niggas ain't gangsta rap, ya'll click like Josey and the Pussycats
When we come around da front, stop

[Wiz]
Uh huh, ya'll can't fuck around ya'll get dropped
When guns pop, who's tellin'
Twin barrel nines wavin' and yellin', QB NIGGA WHAT
Two-time felon, straight to da melon, straight to da dome
Send a nigga back, get da shells, go straight home
Never slip, my +Ill Will+ to survive is so deep
Can't sleep, cousin to death, makes me weak
Pullin' triggers at my shadow, Bravehearts pop up
Wiz, Jungle and Horse shot your block up

[Hook]

Right now my life movin to fast to stop and pray
See every now and then I smile just not today
In my hood they let the choppers spray
Somebody probably got shot today
I named em pop when niggas surfboard
You ain't stoppin me dawg
Only time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards
You grimey as birds shittin on the top of ya fords
You will, die by the gun if you ain't droppin ya sword
I got tattoos as well as lead marks
To me fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start
My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC
Just yesterday guns is blastin with red darts
Beef, you a target
Cause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin won't be the only one the carpet
Man you wanna play wit a ringer?
I ain't a peoples person
I'll give my next door neighbor the finger (fuck you)
Even though I got the shit in the stores
I'm like a nigga that borrow clothes
Bitch, I'm tryin to get in ya draws
Man I'll dump a whole clip in ya mans braids
Pussys love Nelly, he made it look cool to wear bandaids
I'm blowin on damn haze
All of a sudden I'm gassed, cause I'm on the radio and I can't wave
If you ain't up on thangs
Lloyd Banks is the name, G-Units the game
Now I know to keep low when the heat blow
I'll have niggas post up on ya block like I'm shootin the free throw
Still get the green from P-dro, better known as Pedro
I'm ghetto like a patty ya egg-roll
Yea they feinin to stick me, they don't know the nina's is wit me
Snuck in wit Christina and Brittney
You only spend time at the mall
On New Years eve a body drops around the same time as the ball (yea)

(Chorus- Banks)

Keep thinkin I'm candy

Nigaas talkin in the pens and in the street about me
Some jake, tryin to watch every move I make
Cause my diesel will make fiends do the up-town shake
I'm a pro, far from a amateur, holdin more keys than your fuckin janitor
They say "God bless the child that could hold his own"
You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make
I got a ruger on my hip
You ain't gotta like or love me but you gone respect me
You need a fifth and 2 clips to try and check me
12 in the afternoon we can start the clappin
Look homie I'm down for that day-time action
Keep thinkin it's a game time in front of ya home
Get the drop on that ass and shot shadder ya bones (yea)

(Chorus- Banks)

(Tony Yayo)
Listen boy, Tony be the real McCoy
When hoes see the new toy, they jump for joy
And even though the kid rappin
I still got fiens in the hood puffin on that Magic Dragon
My guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my shoes on
Every single night me and my mack get our groove on
Don't get moved on
Cause I shoot through your bicepts your tricepts
Then breeze through ya projects
When the coke come back
It's the China White
And the d don't sweat us in a bag a rice
Let's ride O T
And burn the tape
I got this bad mommy, her mouth's a sperm bank
Since Yayo be a fearless man
I donate my heart to them niggas that ran
And, those niggas in the hood don't wanna see me famous
They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed
You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times
Beware of my wraith, I'm gone school you niggas
Prepare for class
Yo I peep where your puns at, peep where you pumped that
Money you tryin to stack I spent it on blunt wraps

(Banks)

Lil' Kim not a whore
But I s** a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys
When it, come to s** don't test my skills
Cause my head game have you head over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels
.. And I ain't out shoppin spendin dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib giving niggas deep throught
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answerin the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the "Drugs" baby, I'm makin ya high!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + (Lil' Kim)
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
(I am the baddest chick)
(Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight)
(And I'll show you maaagic - what? What?)
Maaagic (uh-huh, uh-huh)
(I got the magic clit)

[Lil' Kim] + (50 Cent)
Now put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tastin it
(s** ain't a race) But I have a thug nigga breakin records
And the time is (one minute, six seconds)
(Magic stick) I got the magic box
Have that ass trickin after one back shot
(The gifts, the ice, I like that a lot)
The minks, the leathers, the cl drop

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]



[Hook]
You niggas say somethin' slick, you'll get slapped for that
You niggas schemin' on some jewels, you'll get clapped for that
If y'all niggas want war, I got the mack for that
Run up with some work, and get your head cracked for that

[Verse 1]
Nigga if a nickel bag sold in the park, I want in on it
The bullshit I'm in right now nigga, I've been on it
If I don't eat, nobody eat, code of the street
No surrender, no retreat, my niggas rollin' with heat
You'll know my stees, I spark trees, under palm trees
Feel a breeze, and fees, in expanded keys
Cop it straight from the bay, tap dance on the yay
Your people make a G day, you ain't rich, you just ok
I take the stand under oath and lie
Before I snitch on my clique, I'll fry
Or watch time go by
Niggas want to steal slabs, and dib or dab
In the posse, who steals from the hands that feed 'em, deserve to die

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 2]
You gettin' money nigga, you thugged out
Well 50 Cent is the hottest shit out this
You bust your gun nigga, you on the run nigga
You treat a grown man, like he ya son
Yo, I ain't the first parolee, to catch his nigga for his rolee
And after being on the street, less than a week (uh huh)
Look, niggas who know me, know I'm up to no good
Man my fan base is spreading like HIV in the hood
Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the milly
A slug'll split a niggas ass, worst than the philly
I stay with the heater, cut the D with Bonita
My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her
It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her
If it wasn't for my seed, I wouldn't even hafta see her
She tried to front like she don't need me, she miss me, believe me
It's that soap opera shit, the bitch watch too much TV

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Aight you niggas tryin' to do too much (STOP FRONTIN')
Them little bit of chips you got son, (AIN'T NOTHIN')
I seen you with your whip outside son (YOU STUNTIN')
You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN')
Rap niggas, they actin' like they ready to flip
When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script
Its like tradition, rap niggas, dyin' they whips
So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit
You a 6 coupe nigga, but you years behind
Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99
You're not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed
Shall up I proceed, I'll write it down so you can read
If you've been listening, I know you like loving what I said
If not you dumb fuck, I just went over your head

[Hook] - 2X



[Hook]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this

[Verse 1]
The only thing hotter than my flow is the block
That's why I left this snow biz and got into show biz
Let's get this clear, it ain't on 'til I say it's on, it's on
I'm eating, ya'll niggas fasting like it's Ramadan
Bowlish way in Lebanon know 50 the bomb
I be at the edge of the bar sipping a Don
I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on
This word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong
You want war? I take you to war now that my money long
Why you broke cats is by the bylines and fantasize
The way I'm spitting, put TV's in everything I sit in
While I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you player haters
Ya'll should hate the game not the players, come on

[Hook]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this

[Verse 2]
Everyday is bugged, niggas will come to a club
To try to show you they a thug instead of showing some love
Now what you think you chump me if I let you bump me
When I'm about to make a mill faster than you make a G?
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor
And in the crack game I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinking I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunchtime I start hitting 'em hard with punchlines
You cats got to be sick to think 50 can't spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro
Plus I pack a cannon up under my Marc Buchanan
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake
Have me running from Jake in a GS with bad brakes
They want to knock the take for Christ sakes

[Hook]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this


[Verse 3]
Yo, son remember them fake players who try to play us
At The Shark Club in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers and beat up gators
Looking like last year's players
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do'
I copped a case of Cristal, he copped one bottle of Mo
From the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he holding
(Yeah he's packing, I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son)
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since ' 81
They ain't here on a hunt for food
So they could catch you some cash and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move
I ain't the one, son, my shit ain't come easy
It won't go easy, believe me

[Hook]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this



[Verse 1]
It's the same shit, feel like a nigga having flashbacks
I might have crack in my ass crack
Back to that rubber handle, 38. special vandal
Play Godfather, bitch, you be dead like Marlon Brando
These bars hit harder than hard times
My flow’ll make a lifer wanna stare at the sunshine
I’ll bring a bitch, you bring a bitch, let's switch
I’mma swing, hit ya face with a pillow case filled with mop wringers
Penitentiary style, big monster swag
Bitch, I got so many tricks make me go in my bag
Yeah, niggas keep saying I’m back, it’s a fact
Ya shaking like ya ass got parkinsons, relax
Confused, acting like a white boy bored
Now you wanna jump a flight of stairs on a skateboard
Nigga, why the fuck ya pants so tight?
You tryna show niggas your ass, your alternative life
I’m hungry like I ain't ate, I lost weight
On a highway it's worth more outta state
I’m raw like Cypress, I could just kill a man
Blow from Mexico’s cartels per kilograms

[Hook]
They love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch, I don’t pretend, pussy, I ain't your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it

[Verse 2]
I going green, emeralds and my watch face drippin'
Nigga ain't no safe safe when I start trippin'
I might call my next LP Death of the Weirdo
I’m high, check my altitude, I’m lounging in the Lear home
Feel a buzz, a little Kool-Aid and Codeine
I say getting your ass whipped is a sure thing
It ain't safe in the war, the war I’m playing my shark tank
On the trip to the mall, made your bitch ass plank
I done touched more pussy than maxipads
Now Detox can be your little rap rehab
Bitch, just a second visit from the repo man
And you can’t afford your monthlys, I mean goddamn
Nigga, you ain't worth your shoes you standing in
When I party I bring a bitch to bring the cannon in
You said you was gonna see me when your homie got shot
It’s been a while so I’m guessing you must've forgot
Once again you forget, ain't this some shit
You forgot about me, bitch, I wrote your hits
You know How We Do, Hate It or Love It
And nigga fuck it I’m special, that's why your ass say my verse

[Hook]



[Intro]
50 Cent, Shady, Aftermath, the dream team
We gotta get the get well cards, niggas is sick

Motion picture shit, haha

[Verse]
Now don't think I won't hit you cause I'm popular
I got a P-90 Reuger to pop at cha
Catch ya slippin' I'mma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded wit' 16 shots for ya
Never had a hot gun on your waist and blood on your shoe
Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you?
Homie you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me and I'm not like you
I'm like a animal wit' it when I spit it it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryina play me
One shot is not enough you need least an Uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start feelin' woozy
I write my life you write what you seen in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me
I found my space at the top I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spray shells through your convertible
Lotus, you notice?
Rich or poor hollows still go through your door, this is war
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back
50 Cent, I know you like that
Yeah I know you like that

[Outro]
Green Lantern
Shady Records
Anger Management Tour, homie

New York, for short call me N.Y

You gon' cause my next felony fuckin 'round, I get the Mac blowin
My heart colder than that corner you get clapped on
The crack gon' show you the barrel, get my jack on
I'm hungry eatin off plates we bag packs on
Gran turismo, Masi', I just lean back on 'em
Stack on 'em, yeah rack after rack on 'em
Ghetto pharmacist man so I'm cuttin the smack for 'em
Pot bubblin yola, I cook that for 'em
Nigga get in the way I'll bang the strap on him
Then line up the wolves and scream "Attack!" on 'em
I'm cool, I'm tryna keep cool, 'til I snap on 'em
I'm comin for a nigga HEAD when I black on 'em

[Hook: 50 Cent]
It's 50, yeah call me Ferrari, call me New York

[50 Cent]
I hate when you niggas do shit then make me ask why
If you the homie why you wanna go and testify?
Why you wanna see a nigga get the chair and fry?
I'll grow old in the yard starin' at the sky
Why you hurt your friends more than your enemies?
And why you don't sit and stroll through your memories?
Why is the question I ask
Shit was all good when you were splittin' up stacks
That shit you told the people got 'em under max
Now why, would you wan' do some shit like THAT?
When that barrel on yo' forehead, don't ask why
Shhh, quiet, close your eyes and die!

[Hook]



[Produced by Manny Perez & Ty Fyffe]

[Verse 1]
I had five hundred grams and fifty in 58 bags
Fo'-hundred Benz, eight thousand in cash
Then the ball dropped, gun popped, Banks got blast
I make it so hot, one shot'll melt yo' ass
Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red
Then told myself in the mirror "nigga, you ain't dead"
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it
When you see me in the hood motherfucker don't talk to me
'Less you wan' talk about using the hawk for me
When Al blew Black away I had him on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich
All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
There I go fronting again, I meant to say laid back
Go 'head move reckless, get banged for your necklace
I serve him with the semi, feed him a clip for breakfast

[Hook]
You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit time the police come
Huh? You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come
Huh? You want some?

[Verse 2]
I got a eighth of dope left, half a pound of purple
Shooters in my circle, try me I'll let 'em murk you
Got more guns than a gun store, beef ain't what you want, boy
You wanna be nice to me, you wanna shoot dice with me
You want a ace on purpose, why you so nervous?
Nigga we from the same hood, we come from the same shit
You got gonorrhea too? We fucked with the same bitch
Getting money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary
And I'm saying that house should be a crack house
Now see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out
The tech and the mac out, the Sig and the Taurus
The Koch and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin'
I let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign
Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded
Toss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it
'Til it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it
Come get it - huh? You want some?
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it
Fuck that nigga - huh? You want some?



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Niggas trying to front? We move on them
One up 'side the waist, squeeze the Ruge on them
Next day we outside like who want it?
Niggas think something is sweet until we move on them

Yeah, niggas want to front? We move on them
Go through that block they pump, wave that Uzi at them
Next day we in the hoopties looking for them
Niggas think something is sweet until we move on them

[Hook: 50 Cent & (Tony Yayo)]
I'm the Mechanic
I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit
I come through to spit clips
(Called the mechanic
Niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
With a hard head; a nigga head open, he soft
I provide these services, we breaking them off
I'm a familiar face from the land of the lost
I used to be a worker bee, now a nigga a boss
It's like every now and then I'm back to being a Mechanic
I split a nigga head, I'm a grease monkey with it
My Momma told me "Baby Boy, the Lord going to bless us"
The dope bought us shit the food stamps couldn't get us
Man, they don't understand, we were just trying to make it
But where I'm from if you want shit, you got to take it
I'm a Trojan of War, I get it done like Achilles
My Tre pound will cut a nigga down on the str-id-eets (streets)
I never had drama with Spics, Jews, or Guineas
But once over a bitch a nigga tried to kill me
I was coming out his projects, I let off the semi
You asking about Nedgme, they know me

[Hook: 50 Cent & (Tony Yayo)] x2
I'm the Mechanic
I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit
I come through to spit clips
(Called the mechanic
Niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this

[Bridge: Tony Yayo]
We don't play that pussy shit. We move on them
We put that work in. Nigga, we move on them
Shorty, I know you ain't scared. We move on them
Here, the hammer right here. Now move on them

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Niggas is loose, I grab the cig and tighten niggas up
I lost my path in the dark, I'm lighting niggas up
I'm the school yard with your kid playing dodge ball
Then out come the hammer, can shorty dodge those?
I got a few screws missing, maybe even a bolt
A few shooters with me, down to go for the fall
I say "Get'em!" they get to killing like I'm running the court
Then get down with these around. The hulks in your throat
This is not amateur night and this ain't the Apollo
Ain't nothing saying the sun is coming out tomorrow
Your arm is broke and the promise of Death is coming
So if you want for me that homicide, I'm gunning

[Hook: 50 Cent & (Tony Yayo)] x2
I'm the Mechanic
I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit
I come through to spit clips
(Called the mechanic
Niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Money buys guns, paranoia comes
When the drama comes, go ahead pussy run
Friends turned foes, Daddy girl's turn hoes
In the penitentiary hearts turn cold
Some turn snitch for State's evidence
While the big boys with the blow keep getting rich
When the drama comes they way they don't fucking panic
They hop on the phone quick to holler at mechanics

[Hook: 50 Cent & (Tony Yayo)] x2
I'm the Mechanic
I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit
I come through to spit clips
(Called the mechanic
Niggas on that snitch shit

[50 Cent]
It's a fact homie, eagles don't fly in flocks
But the eagles I got hold sixteen shots
Like beefin', homie I ain't sayin' a word
I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the clutch, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told them you respect me, now tell them I'm the nicest
Admit it nigga, I'm a mid-life crisis

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang

[Lloyd Banks]
It's like niggas rate the respect of who gat bigger
Banks been blowin' on purple stuff before that fat nigga
Pennies make dollars, and dollars make death threats
I'm doin' remixes to bulletproof the Lex next
Duck nigga, everyday's war
I'm heavy on sports, so my drawer's like the NBA store
Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' em down
We're in the pound puttin' fear in the clown
I'm running with gangstas, don't make one of em shank ya

[Tony Yayo]
I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back

You wanna dance, let's dance nigga, I take you to the prom
I'm armed, trey-pound in my palm, I'm calm nigga
My momma made a baby boy, the hood made a man
My first 14 grams, took that and made a grand
I do this, you knew this, I told you pussy
Your fate, your death day'll fucking come if you push me
Have you like E.I. E.I., uh-oh after the four-four blow
I get low, they say I go like a pro
It's a wrap and I'm ghost in the smoke like a roach
You've been clapped and in fact there's no coming back from that
I'm the last of my breed, no Henny, no weed
Just my vest and my semi in the back of the Bentley
Enage, a mirage, see I'm there, then I'm gone
Cause my lawyers are strong and my money is long
So when I'm right I'm right, and when I'm wrong I'm right
I hit your ass up right, nigga it's nighty-night

I'm in your top 8 nigga, drop 8 nigga
G-C-T Coupe, it's sour grape nigga
I'm an ape nigga, a guerilla in the mist
I hold weight, nigga, my connect got bricks
I went gold, you went platinum, we still got the same cars
Same house, and still fuck the same broads
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
Damn you look good girl but get your teeth fixed
I'm the Teflon Don boy, I get busy
Your next two songs you do them shits with Pretty Ricky
Seven-sixty, drive by light tint
With two hoes in the whip looking like flint

Now me I get it in, I get it in

[Verse 1]
Look as soon as I step in the club
I swear my nigga, you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can't be responsible for what I say or I do
When I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next morning saying bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me but the word about me
That I'm no trick, I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP, with my niggas round me
Saying y'all can have whatever you want

[Bridge]
Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink

[Verse 2]
I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so
I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to dropping it low, like the dancers do
In the Go-Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance, she get to breaking it down
We get the bouncing outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow, we got paper to blow
My whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through son, we look like bread
My '89 grind, make my old nine shine
Like we been moving bricks round this bitch for years
I say I get it in it's because I get it in
Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I feeling a spend my G, she fuck with me I'm into win
I'm cooler than her ma then we do this shit again

[Bridge]

[Refrain - 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
Man I run this rap shit
(Get ya hands up high, hands up high, hands up high)
Rest in peace to Biggie Smalls
(Get ya hands up high, hands up high, hands up high)
R.I.P. to 2Pac
(Get ya hands up high, hands up high, hands up high)
Nigga roll that good shit
(Get ya hands up high, hands up high, hands up high)
(Here we go!)

[50 Cent]
You wanna dance, let's dance nigga
I'll take you to the prom
I'm armed, tre pound in my palm
I'm calm nigga, my mama made a baby boy
The hood made a man, my first 14 grams took that and made a grand
I do this, you knew this, I told you pussy
You faked your death, hater fuckin comin from pussy
I'll have like EE II EE II UH OH, after the fo-fo blow I get low
That's how I go like a pro, it's a rap, I'm a ghost
And you smoke like a roach, you been clapped
And the fact there's no comin' back from that
I'm the last of my breed
Mo henny, no weed, just my vest and my semi
In the back of the Bentley, I'm a nas and a rase
I'm there and I'm gone
My lawyers are strong, and my money is long
So when I'm right, I'm right, and when I'm wrong, I'm right
I'lll hit yo ass up right, nigga its nighty night!

[Refrain - 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]

[Booba]
Je prends le contrôle renoi, laisse le rap HS
Diamant sur le HF, Pont de sèvre t'achève
C'est trop cher pour toi ? J'achète
Doigt sur la gâchette, pousse-toi ! hachek
Lève lève lève tes mains en l'air, ton gun, ton revolver
Le jack est dans mon verre, la chatte à sa grand-mère
C'est panam panam, G-unit, 92 izi clik de macaques
Million d'euros cash sous le clic-clac
Rien de banal, je ne suis pas très halal
Passe le cash ou le banana ou la clik te passe le salam
C'est boulbi au micro, c'est Brazza c'est Mala
Ne me cherche pas négro car je ne suis pas là
T’es synonyme de défaite, je n'compte plus mes prouesses
Élevé parmi les wesh wesh, nos flingues viennent d'URSS
Tu veux savoir qui suis-je ? Où est-ce ?
Les suceurs de queue plus ils m'aiment plus je les déteste

[Intro]
Ayo, I know these niggas don't like me
But I don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what I'm saying?
50 cent, 9-9, motherfucking Doo Wop
Volume 3, take it however the fuck you wanna take it
Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)

[Verse 1]
Yo, they shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll 'em over, take that Pelle Pelle
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even Puff and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm saying this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son, I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rapping niggas dying to shine
And I'm tired of fiends asking for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punchline from me may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down before I make change
Yo, the sale went stale, caught 'em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man indictment, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an O.Z
My man brought 'em to me, see he ain't really know, B
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just trying to prop to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him O.Z.'s then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-d's -- damn man, I O.D
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holding the heat
Po-po walking to beat, we burning L's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over, I can't believe it, damn it's over
Feds seized the Six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rolling in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
.380 six-shot Glock top loader
Keep it in my waist, son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga, so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfucking marathon

[Outro]
Come on, bounce, nigga, bounce
Wop the reason why y'all motherfuckers say bounce, bitch
Niggas, niggas don't set trends, niggas just jump on dicks
That's why they Bloods and Crips now

[Verse 1]
How you gonna take this? like a man or a bitch?
You gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
Man, I stack chips and I unload clips
After 3 summers in the jail I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
You know me, started sellin' leak in the yard
Yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
Big as hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
Damm dog, you been in here that long?
You could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
A convo is only three words, "yo what up"
You ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
And you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After witnesses disappear on the strength of they team
I'm hard as hell to get along wit' so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper - blowin' the lah
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now?
If I catch you going to sick call I'm'a ox you down
Niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
In here a gemstar is like a nine milli chrome
It's similar, in fact they'll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home

[Hook]
You got blown over the jack? (that ain't gangsta)
Your man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)
Rockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)
You only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas juxed you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)
You ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)
If you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)

[Verse 2]
You'd call me Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box so much it seems like I'm visitin' pop-ulation
When I walk by, niggas like "Fifty don't play son"
"yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga..."
Max out, I'm goin' straight for the Glock
Bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
The things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
Down goes the window....out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet
Some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
Some get it in the foot, bleed all over their Air Max
Nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
It's extortion, it happens in the hood often
Claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
Cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit cause I stay on that block shit
That 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
See the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
Ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
Leave with your blood on my mink in the drop six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
Since '86 my whole clique pop Criss

[Hook]

[Outro]
5-5-1 BRRRAAAT BRRRAAAT
1-3-4 BRRRAAAT BRRRAAAT
What the fuck you know about that?



[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Yeah
It is what it is, son, niggas can’t stand it
It’s my fifth lap, a nigga been round and round the planet
Shorty said ‘Welcome to Miami'
Her friends sayin 'Welcome to Miami'
Jet-skies, the yacht, the hawk in the backyard
Back to back Porshes, a nigga go that hard
I love money, nigga this is drug money
Laundromat, spin cycle, make it snow money
Beef nothin’ to a nigga, nigga I’m comfy'
Throw a hundred racks on a bitch, I told ya she want me
If I want the ho, I get the ho, fuck the ho then forget the ho
Let a ho be a ho, play the pimp, pay the rent
I’m a fly nigga on or off, yeah I buy fly shit
Presidential rolly nigga tell me now, can you buy that?
I’m the biggest nigga Southside seen since Fat Cat
I tell a nigga suck a dick quick cause I’m strapped back

[Hook - 50 Cent]
I make it double up, few blocks of raw
I, I, I did it, I got to get more
I make it double up, baking soda galore
Till we in Bentleys and mansions with marble on the floor
I make it double up
Aye bring me that pyrex
Get the baking soda, the ice
I'mma show you how you do this shit
You think I don’t know what I’m doing but I know what I’m doin

[Verse 2 - Hayes]
We on the other side of the border chilling with drug lords
Tryin put a order in during the drug wars
Jay said this is what happens when you disrespect one of us
And cut a muhfucka head off right in front of us
That’s when I said i’m going back to cali
My man said he going back to cali
I know some Mexicans in Arizona I’m cool with
I’d rather slang that than come and deal with this bullshit
‘cause I ain't gonna budge
Pay me or die g, dog, it ain't no love
Niggas know who they owe
My number ain’t changed bitch
Front door service put one in your brain quick
Could've put it right in your chest close range shit
Watch you die slow let you know who you playin' with
Fuck all that swearin' to god, promise and prayin' shit
I ain't a big sob story fan, I'm spraying shit
12 gauge, AR-15, AK'n shit
Passenger seat's gon' get killed, I'm sayin' this princ-i-pals
We don't draw the line at drug dealing, we crim-i-nals
Goin' all out
Before I say you played me I’ll go in ya'll house
And get killed there or blow your fucking brains out
You gotta bring your ass to get some
You gotta make cash to spend some
And I ain’t a victim mothafucka
Hayes

[Intro]
Yeah! It's 50!

[Hook]
She got a habit man she powder her nose
And you can see she was a freak I suppose
She in the telly she use all three holes
Man you know me I just go with the flow
Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit

[Verse 1]
And it's on, up and down she like to ride on top
Fast, prayin that the condom pop
That's foul, but fuck it it's all hood to me
Now Hollywood's been real real good to me
Now who gives a fuck if a bitch just ain't shit
In the whip she gives CPR to my dick
You losin 'em baby, get 'em up quick
This role play I'm really gettin into this shit
In the telly om all fours I'm ridin that horse
Screamin WOO HA!!! till my voice is lost
Call me 50 call me daddy you can call me the boss
My dick XXL you can call me The Source
You can lie 'bout my performance and give bad reviews
A quickie suppose to be quick bitch I kept on my shoes
Oh you thought we had a love thing girl you confused
Don't listen to the gossip it's never ever true
They say I do things that I never ever do
On the radio, they say me and you a item
Nas fall in love with hoes me I just like 'em
I can't be your man Paris head game great
And Eve's usin dildos on her sex tape
Ashanti's lil' ass butt naked in the truck
These bitches is poppin off why would I tie myself up
At the Super Bowl Janet Jackson showed me a tit
Other niggas saw it but I felt she showed me it
Times is hard in the yard baby this is real shit
My record sales slow, I'm a show you my dick

Bridge:
Wait a minute baby hold on, I'm just tryin to fix the camera
You know, relax, ha ha h, I'm comin, yeah
It's on you got the water in the tub
Wanna get in the tub, ha ha ha ha

Chorus:
She got a habit man she powder her nose
And you can see she was a freak I suppose
She in the telly she use all three holes
Man you know me I just go with the flow
Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit, and it's on

Wit the gun to her head sayin "Daddy come home"

[Hook]
When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
Woah - wave - woah - wave
I wave the heat to eat, waive my right to speak
Plead the fifth y'all, don’t tell 'em shit y'all
Woah - wave - woah - wave

[Verse 1]
I'm not telling you to shoot somebody
But if somebody try to shoot you shoot 'em
Don't waste time, little nigga just do it
Any nigga out of order must be serviced
See now now you hesitating, boy, you making me nervous
The Feds know I clap heat, felonies on my rap sheet
Front on me, try to run from me, hollows be up your back, B
Pistol pop, copper top, burn, baby, burn
Revolver spinning again and again, you niggas never learn
Got a itchy itchy itchy itchy trigger finger, nigga
So if you hit me and you get me I'll be back to get ya
Man I might bring the homies in that's if it's necessary
See you might not be worried, but I think you should worry
Them bullets come in flurries, next thing you know you're buried
Yeah, I do away with nine niggas in nine days
My nine sprays when shit don't go my way
Hold it sideways, fuck around, cause a crime wave

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I talk about my arsenal, I rap about my infantry
Them crackers they be scared of me, the hood man, they into me
Yeah - I'm #1 on Forbes
Yeah - they can't fuck with your boy
Tax time is crack time, I flip that, get that back
Louie V. nap sack filled up with G-stacks
I'm sick in the head, me I'm all 'bout the bread
Go 'head fuck with the kid, see it's just what I said
See the stash, I'm making double, making kilos bubble
Gem star, boy, I cut you til' your ma don't know you
See when we play them warriors come out to play
You wanna play? Get your ass laid out today
See I'm back on the shit I was on before
So if a nigga try to stunt we gon' take 'em to war

[Hook]

[Outro]
Man, I be on some other shit, these niggas can't fuck with me
Yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The homie said he fuck with me, I have him hit you up for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Try to remain calm, you fucking with a don
Pocket full of green, green in the bong
That bitch with the bow-legged stance turning me on
Two mil' timepiece, rainbow Tourbillon
Niggas still want me dead like Osam'
But they ain't gon' make it they come at me wrong
Them niggas all workers, I'll smack the shit out they bosses
Ferrari, I'm stronger than 500 horses
Money is power, you niggas better wake up
My ear rings blinking, that's old shit from Jacob
Add it up, four plus four, that's eight karats
You can't run and get you a bill, you ain't got it
Blackjack we do that, ten grand a hand
You can get shot fucking with Floyd, that's my man
Billionaire brotherhood, we call this the Money Team
Pinky ring flawless, my God I'm gorgeous

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, ho remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, don't ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, nigga remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, this a Al-Qaeda bomb

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm chilling like a villain while I'm dealing, I am
Ruling while I'm cooling with my tool in my hand
Post up, coast up, this is my life, bitch
Up close on ya, you'll get stuck with a knife, bitch
Cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
Got a lot of hoes, but Charlene that's my white bitch
The rest of my bitches, nah they ain't gon' like this
But I don't give a fuck cause they all love this nightstick
But I still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
Collar popped up, cool as the Fonz
Motherfucker! Have a seat and loosen up
Get a glass of some gin, now juice it up, deuces up
See it's a line there for a reason
And if you cross it, no more breathing, ya leaving
Believe it - we understand each other?
Cause I would hate to have to put a slug in ya, brother - ya dig?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Precious Paris]
Four fifth on that shit, that Glock copped to ya face
My twat cocked in ya face, you know you wan' taste
Alexander McQueen, strapless with my back out
Six inch DaVinci's, a bitch finna act out
Niggas on my heels tryna find out what the head like
I know what the bread like, my butt give y'all headlight
Shine like I shine, night or daytime
But Nah, na na na na
Make a nigga wan' buy everything I say buy - ma na na na na
Get wet, I got that comeback, that crack
My assets is my ass, jack
Stun, I tell my niggas right where yo stash at
You fucking with a Southside bitch, I go where the money go
I'm madam put on a stroll, Get my money ho
Catch me in Ferragamo or Dolce & Gabbana
Or ?, I'm B squared up, what

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Look If you ain't worth a mil, you ain't far from broke
Got enough heart to sell weed but you scared of dope
I wouldn't snitch on my peoples if the feds bribed me
Yo ass would hit more notes than Ron Isley
I wouldn't rhyme about Rolleys if I had no watch
Wouldn't write about crack if I ain't had no spot
You talk six coupe's, shit you only pushing a trey
Got bitches shutting you down in the C.L.K
For cats like you, crime don't pay
You just linger in the hood, them niggas blow you away
You the type to get paper when I'm locked up, get yo jewels rocked up
Then have to tuck em in when I pop up
Niggas in the hood sayin "50's Grimy"
Cause they hit me with consignment and now they can't find me
If you see it how I see it, my watch is yo whip
And I can cop another one after each assist

[Hook]
You ain't no gangsta
You'se a busta, a customer, a sucker
You fake fraudulent motherfucker
You ain't a gangsta
I should cut ya, cock back and bust ya or stomp you out
Cause we don't trust ya

[Verse 2]
You owe a nigga? You don't wanna pay him?
Kill him, that's what they said Ta Ta did to Peewee
Y'all ain't got to believe me
When I'm done with this rhyme if theres time I'll hit a flick
Wit Mariella, this connect bitch, Peruvian chick
She ain't hot but everytime I fuck, the coke price drops
When it's time to get it on (what)
I pull over the thong (uh huh)
Fuck till I nut then get up, I'm gone (yeah)
Usualy hit it watchin tele way out in L.A
I like it when she say "Papi I feel it in my Belly"
Call up all my niggas in New York on the celly
First thing I'm sayin is "Nigga what da deally"
Pack a trey pound up under my Pelle Pelle
Y'all niggas want war, clap clap, Oh really?
I watch niggas sling packs in front of the Deli
Got 20 inch chrome sittin on my Pirelli's
Lorenzo on the Benzo, nigga you feel me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fix the cell, blast the room devil spray, turnin proof
Ho whip, bulet proof, you ain't fuckin wit me, duke
Bricks from Filipe, 19 five, what we pay
Cop on a weekend, hard to catch em on a weekday
Niggas backed up, slugs to the gut, that'll bet him up
Gettin fed thru his arm in a hospital will slim him up
Get it thru yo head, 50 Cent don't care
I cock triggers light the blockup, iller than times square
Real shit, you spit it cause you seen it
I spit it cause I did it and I mean it
Man, I don't like none of y'all
Fuck around I'll run in y'all pop one in y'all
Had the whole hood talkin bout what I done to y'all
Listen I don't give a fuck if you blood or cuz
I got love for thugs niggas firing slugs
Stage rapping ass niggas ain't sold no drugs
Gotta show me some love cause my shit is unplugged

[Hook]



Yeah!
50 Cent, Lloyd Banks
Tony Yayo, G-Unit!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part in my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right (What?)
To send a motherfucker at you tonight (Uh-huh~!)
G-Unit!!

[Lloyd Banks]
And I ain't stoppin 'til my click poppin, swimmin in barrels of money
Ma can walk around with her head up cause her child ain't a dummy
It's funny - niggas'd rather see you sufferin and hungry
I'm comfy as hell, skatin with another nigga's money (WOO~!)
You lying your ass off; you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin your mask off, as soon as you act up (WHAT~!)
You know what I came for, a peace of the game or
Artillery that's 'bout as long as a chainsaw
I'm wide awake, but it still feels like I'm dreamin
40 cal' under my pillow condom feeling my semen
The physical presence of a female's the form of a demon
That's why I, fuck 'em and leave 'em get my nut while I'm breathin (YEAH~!)
Never thought they'd catch me slippin now I'm duckin and drippin
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you grippin
You trippin, no record can get my ass in position
Death waits for no religon whether catholic or christian
Listen; I went through momma bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause as poppa was in and out the prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect the odds
We got more four-fives and 9's then a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)
Niggas hatin when you do good, but when you broke
Your friends and your enemies they love you (they love you)
Chi-Chi, get the llello (get the llello)
Picture me bein cracked, out of town trips on the train - WHAT~?!
Chi-Chi, get the Yayo
Picture me bein cracked... (TONY YA-YO!!!) here we go
You can sniff me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin country
Wall Street niggas, they cop me on a low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on a bus, the train, a plane
I'm smuggle, I'm nuttin but trouble
I'll make your money double, cook me in bakin soda
I'll turn your who-rock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill ya 'fridgerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
You can put me in the door panels or your stash box
Put me in your Nikes, Timbs and Reeboks
If you copped three and a half, you hustlin backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin forwards (what?)
I'm tryin to move more birds, in P.A. all day
On the corner of 3rd - nigga what?!

[50 cent)
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (WHAT?!)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)

Picture me polishin pistols, I'm comin to get you, the shells hit you
You scream, think I'm playin - I mean it
Man I done brought all these pistols, let's get it poppin
Start to wavin my embroidered shell casings get to droppin
The devil's 'round the corner I got to much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket, just stunt and I'll pop it
I'm dyin to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you numbered for death
As the world turns, the lessons should be learned
Count all my blessings, clean up my weapons, I'm ready for war
The strong survive, the weak shall perish, I told you before
Hoes they compliment me now like 50 - nice chain!
Belagio, twenty grand of chips at the dice game
Ballin out, can't stop it, you gotta watch MTV
BET, nigga you see me~!!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin good
Or cause niggas feel me, more than you in yo' hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin and you don't bust your gat
You pussy!!

Yeah explain it to the niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin front nigga
Talk all that gangsta shit on the record; I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga; ask around in my hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talk about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
You pussy... get it poppin!

{NON-STOP... can't forget... Shady, Aftermath!}

Yo LA niggas are the rowdy niggas

Yo, your man could have ran when I robbed him but he froze
Son I ain't even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed
The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she chose
Now you heartbroke, that's what you get for lovin them hoes
An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid
Runnin round without no heat, it like a fifth with no kick
A fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit
A bad bitch that won't blow dick
It's like a rollie with no ice, a gamblin spot with no dice
Like fuckin supermodel bitches and not bustin off twice
I murda any mic device, for the right price, I'm nice
I only say things once, never twice, dont fuck with me

[Hook]

I'm F to the I - F -T - Y - C - E - N - T
Caress your girl gently in back of the Bentley
You thought she was pimpin, son I was in the Hamptons
In a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch lampin
I plan to take over New York and start expandin
Was Bob Marley singin about tecs when he sung "I'm Jammin'"
Nigga fuck with my cash and I'mma blast yo' ass
Smash the Glock out the stash in the dash an [mash]
Flee in a flash, lay low let time go past
If you survive the shots I'mma find yo' ass
Put the gat to your head and remind your ass
I ain't playin with you, I want my money motherfucker

[Hook]
The VA cats is rowdy rowdy

They'll body you and act like they know nothing about it

[Verse Three]
Yo, some nigga just shot the block up, god (Word?)
He had the same shit you got on, dog (Word?)
I know you done did it so get the fuck up outta hear, ya heard?
I run with niggas that spray and strip and say that shit
You won't let us pump on your block, fuck it, we makin it hot
I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch
From the cordless cell phone, and the baby blue drop
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street
Cause these industry cats are startin to look like something to eat
They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand
My niggas live in section eight in public housing
They murder you and keep shit low cause niggas heard of you

[Hook]
Them B-More cats is rowdy rowdy

They'll body you and act like they know nothing about it
Leave your body somewhere where no nobody can find it

Them Jersey cats is rowdy rowdy
Them Boston ballas is rowdy rowdy
If they say they gon' wet you boy, don't you doubt it
Got your gun, well don't leave home without it
Rowdy rowdy! Bout it bout it



[Intro]
They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and I stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown, nah
They will never ever take my crown, nah
They will never ever take my crown, nah

I'm still shit, I meet y'all ready
Fuck around will be reading your obituary
My whip clean, my watch gleam
9 karats ho, that's what I call a pinky ring
Don't even trick, my heart cold
I'm round the globe, I'm on parole
I ball hard, I go hard
They say I'm grimy, up to no good
Oh god
Shawty work that, we should work that
She a canna, she damn close to perfect
I might want stunt, throw a hunned racks
Get my man strapped, he gonn get my money back

I'm ghetto right, I'm super hood
I'm shitting on these niggas like they knew I would
I'm ghetto right, I'm super hood
I'm shitting on these niggas like they knew I would

Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things get better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officer asking for ah search
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first

Gram after gram, time after time
I got the grind
I can't help it, I gotta shine
I do it big, you stupid big
I could fit like half the projects in my crib
You stick around, I'm outta here
You on the ground, I'm in the lear
I love yachts, a 9 boats
Either way, come a nigga got you picking dough
They done made me mad, now I'm in my bad
And I'm back with the strap catch a case be the case
Rich nigga swag
Every step I take, every lil itsy bitsy move I make
Turn the big bags a birthday cake
I can even fit this shit in my safe
Wait!

Got more money coming, try not to hate
Why you think a nigga in and out a state?
I'm a pro, I'mma go when I operate
I get the bread, I blow the bread
I'm flashing, I'm shining
I get the bread, I blow the bread
My bitches, my diamonds

Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things get better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officer asking for ah search
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first



[Hook]
Ah, I got big bags of paper I’mma spend
We gon' do it how we do it, then do the shit again
You should fuck with a winner bitch if you wanna win
We’re celebrating like a nigga home fresh out the pen

[Verse 1]
I’m on, bitches all on my John
To get bread and don’t blow bread, the fuck is the point
Call me Elroy, I be on some Jetson shit
Pop a x and the blue pill then wreck a bitch
I like it raw, uh baby, uh baby, I like it raw
Take a chill pill bright and early tomorrow
The morning after, plan b, no kids involved
Please no kids involved
I put that money in the vault bitch usain bolt
Progress…make a deal then blow mills for real
Time’s a wasting, you watching my watch, ha
You old school, huh, jocking my style

[Hook]

I don’t give a flying fuck, I always make bail
Motherfuck an award, check Forbes, i’m there
Not once, every year
Even when I take a break, my pockets is in shape
I’m back off a vacation
Can you believe it, I been getting paid on vacation
Yeah, i’ma keep niggas forever hating
They thought i’m going down
Now look, i’m levitating
I’m with Deepak meditating
In Somalia & Kenya with United Nations
Funding the world food program
Finna solve world hunger, god damn

{*set to Dr. Dre & Snoop's "Deep Cover" instrumental*}

[50 Cent]
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
50 Cent nigga, Tony Yayo (yeah)
{WHOOOOOO... KID}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Yeah! And you don't stop
I do a 187 on your motherfuckin block
Yeah! And it don't quit
It's G-Unit in your motherfuckin ass bitch~!

[Tony Yayo]
They say good things should happen to those who wait
But I'm stuck in the game still slingin weight
For that eggshell white, that tan and the brown
For a XL-6 or a seven four pound
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with cameras in the mirror, nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights, with flyin cooks
Cause my verse sound nice when they fly in hooks
Now I'm blowin weed yo, in Beverly Hills
With some bad freak hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer, stash box with the llama
I drive through in the blue data bomber
Heaven or hell'll prevail when I'm a goner
Cause I eat up tracks, like Hannibal and Dahmer
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
Cause life is a hustle, any day you be a goner
P89 Ruger with the silencer
Let off a clip it sound like spitballs goin through straws
We got, plenty of ratchets but not on sale
We even got villagers that hold shotgun shells
These rappers is talkin 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it, my work is never watered down
So on the first I get mo' checks than Nike Town
Sling in thirty-one hundreds, I been on the block
Since niggas did the snake, running man and the wop
When I was 15, I ain't want no workin papers
I played the strip all night, servin niggas
Listen nigga, we live like Italians in jail
I got C.O.'s bringin cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you
Fill your ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid-fire
I had you on the run like Omar on "The Wire"
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun
I'm a hustler, O.G.'s love to hate
Cause I got old school money put away in the safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck Judge Wong, he won't catch me on the corner
Nigga pay poor tax, homey you owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for your see through Roley
I be in M mansion, strippin them models
His bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the guns if you ain't got enough beef
The shit I spit'll cause an all out riot
And my new four-fifth'll cause a hollow-tip diet
I'm the type to tie up your lady, and gun butt your baby
I'm like the mob nigga, fuck you pay me~!
I'mma hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick twenty mill' and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now its time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot
I need twelve 12's, and fifty-eight 58's
Cause I got eight sales and they all gon' wait motherfucker!

[Hook]

YEAH!
{Ha ha... WHOOOOO KID!!}



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yo, this is 50 cent, yaknawsaying?
I'm here with my man Whoo Kid
You know how I put it down. nigga
It's not safe around here as soon as the street lights
G-Unit. nigga

[Hook: 50 Cent]
We can't get money selling weed - (we gon' sell coke)
Ain't no money selling coke - (we gon' sell dope)
Ain't no money selling dope - (we gon' sell X)
And if niggas won't buy the X - (then we gon' sell tech's

[Verse 1]
My advice for y'all niggas is stop frontin'
Cause if 50 say "pop something" I'm gon pop something, what up?

[50 Cent]
Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
Send twelve shots to you, run four in the clip
Get in the whip, it's a wrap

[Havoc]
Nah, fuck that

[50 Cent]
Man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head, that's that
Niggas running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out

[Tony Yayo]
50 let me drive

[50 Cent]
Nah, I got this, nigga, chill out

[Lloyd Banks]
It'd be nice to get a niggas' ice, get it, getting  back

[50 Cent]
Just get in the corner store cause it's full of them Arabs
They blowing the shit up like it's okay
I got a bomb on my waist, I'm Kamikaze
I dare D's to get next to me

[]
Or a nigga to creep up and put a tec to me

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah that's-that's it, nigga
That's it, it's a freestyle
The fuck you want for free?
Fucking Arabs just ran the fucking planes into the building
Coke price went up 10 grand this fucking week



[Intro: 50 Cent's son Marquise]
Yo daddy, these nigga's ain't hood, drop that shit

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
So what I grew up with them niggas, i ain't stuck with them niggas
We from the same hood but I don't fuck with them niggas
Shit pop off, I touch one of them niggas
Cut one of them niggas, buck one of them niggas
Beg For Mercy, number four, I'm so hood
First LP, ten-million sold, I'm so good
I thought niggas would love to see me shine
But it's making them sick to see me getting mine
Got that Benz, got that Bentley, and that new Bugatti
Got that Range, Aston Martin, and that new Ferrari
If it's making you sick to see me blow I'm sorry
Dude we used to be cool, but I ain't stuck with you nigga
I grew up with you nigga, but I don't fuck with you nigga
Got shot in the back then turned around and got shot in the eye
You ain't gonna shoot back lay down and die
There's a message in my music, can you hear it Kai?
Your man's never gonna blow and you're the reason why
It's disease infested when I spit it any nigga can get it
Fuck the fronting and the rhymes that ass'll get flat-lined
Can't we all just get along? we used to be friends
Nah, fuck that, man we used to pretend
These niggas is comedians, I thought I was type funny
Five called telling niggas, "mutt need bail money"
On some real shit, would you bail a nigga out son, that knew niggas was trying to kill you and wouldn't let you hold a gun
Think about it
Hahaha

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Regardless of what you done heard or hearing
Fuck all the comparing I dare them to come anywhere near him
They want someone famous to pout with so I walk around with my gun like it came with the outfit
I don't really like to toot my own horn but beep, click clack, blat, go to sleep
We all know since you was in the class with Legos, you'd grow up to be as soft as mash potatoes
Your man gonna make me throw this nigga towards the window and put his ass in the air like the Jordan symbol
All my diamonds are colored, I Fruity Pebble'd the right hand, fifty-five grand on the bezel from Ice Man
They want to give your boy the 40 cal and nina so I stay on my toes like a ballerina
I'm starving nigga, the only one that can cut me and get away with it is my barber, nigga
Cause I'll revolve a nigga, take a piece of your head
You'll have more room in your hat than a Harlem nigga
And now most of these subliminal raps be coming from the same niggas backstage giving you daps
Like, "yo banks you hot and everybody says it and I think it'd be real big if we could do a record"
But now I'm on some other shit
Like I ain't fucking with none of you niggas on a record unless you my brother shit
I'm an intelligent man and my elegant band got more colors than elephant man
Since hell is at-hand I mine as well expand hand over my can
Tan all over the lamb, lamb all over the sand
The sun all over the beach, your eyes all over my bitch
Her eyes all on your moves incase one of them switch
If you don't learn to relax and swallow steam, there'll be more shells in the grass than halloween



[Hook: Brooklyn]
I still be riding through the 'hood
Brooklyn to Compton, it's all good
From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should

[50 Cent]
I'm hot boy, I told you before
Got that Benz and that Hummer off the showroom floor
I know you hate it when I pop up, wrist all rocked up
In The 'hood, empty niggas locked up, they rats all knocked up
Baby after baby, the 'hood is crazy
Niggas'll set you up and wet you up, trust me they shady
Got a pet bulldog, I keep under my linen
It don't bark, they spark when the revolver spinnin'
We winnin'

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Hold up, hold up, get a good look at my rims
God damn, look at them twenty-fours diamonds spin
Now the D's, they harass me in the 'hood
A few times, niggas try to blast me in the 'hood
Fuck it's all good
Catch me in the coupe - on the lean
Wit' needles and samples and diesels for the fiends
The money stay on my mind, so I stay on the grind
Plus niggas like to stun, so I stay wit' my nine
I ain't the type nigga that be out, runnin' his mouth
Talkin' gangsta and shit, with my gun in the house
Now homie, you better get to know me better
Before you be leakin' pints of blood into Iceberg sweater
When the talons come flyin' up out the beretta
You gon' feel like it's yo' fault and say "Man I knew better"
Look dogg, I don't play that shit
I pull that thing out I'mma spray that shit
That how I get down

[Brooklyn]
Brooklyn she's so sick in the hood
Got these fat bitches get the spit in the hood
Cause I throw diamonds, shot that fifth in the hood
That's what you get for talkin' all that shit in the hood
Yeah I'm still a minor, remember this
Everything Brooklyn choppy broads still behind ya
Brooklyn to Compton it's all good
Get robbed, get shot, shit is poppin' in the hood

[Hook] - repeat 2X



Feat. B.I.G., Eminem

[Intro: 50 cent]
I love niggas! I love niggas!
Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!!)
I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again)
And to all niggas that do it I love

[B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (You niggas understand?!)
To all my Bronx (It's war nigga)
To all my Queensbridge (I'll blow you away)

[Verse: B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's a real nigga for ya

[Chorus: 50 Cent] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Verse: B.I.G.]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the ruler

[Chorus] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Verse: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hail the Henny
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people feel your awkward
I tame I'm not lame
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo punk ass off propa'
This new place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged you know, bump my shit, bitch!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Eminem]
I got 50 Cent

So watch what you say
Before you call our name
If you say one more thing
It won't be nice

[Verse: Eminem]
Here we go
I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jellous of us to love us
You ain't it
G-Unit made it
And Obie's comin
D-Twizzy's comin
You sick to your stomach
50% is 50-Cent
The other 50% is who's color skin it is
Well if you're even considering takin our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get too intriqette into it
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cuz then it's gunna get to the point where it escalates into some other shit
Then Im a flip
Then Im a get to stompin in my Air Force One's
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's gunna feel like there's so many feet kickin you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
Thinkin they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Ya'll tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have pink tiggle me
Hickory dickory dock tickoty tock tickety a little bit of the diggity dock diggity
Mixed with a little bit of the jiga jig jiga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity

[Chorus: Eminem] x2
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cuz we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa sho

But we just gonna sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck yall do



[Intro]
Sprinkle a little 2Pac on it (It ain't easy bein' me)
I'm legendary I'm necessary
They call me Ferrari they call me 50
Call me big homie
Hah

[Verse 1]
I got a bad bitch over the crib, I'm finna pop her off
Nigga call me in 30 I beat her and dropped her off
It's a quickie the ass and the lips are super soft
And to top it off, she topped me off
Niggas trynna front on my swag, knock it off
Put the strap to the back of your knot and knock it off
Homicide they have to come through, block it off
That's what they do after that choppa get to choppin' off (It ain't easy bein' me)
They say a nigga off, and think a nigga off
I'm on the runway one way takin' off

[Hook]
Off and on, these niggas be off and on

[Verse 2]
Go 'head and ask about 50's Ferrari, I never take a loss
I'm a boss, tell niggas to let it off, set it off
Diamond cloth, plush lawn, it's floss at all costs
God damnit it all costs, get it now, half off (It ain't easy bein' me)
Diamond stud show off, nigga's swag is so off
They stunt till I go off, the 6 hour blow off
My wahi mahi-mahi teriyaki I'm so cocky
Who the fuck out here to stop me, nigga haters sit and watch me
And it seem like it is but it's not the same man niggas ain't got what I got my man
Got a flow so pure like brick cocaine nigga bitch wanna be my secret man
Freaky thing you eat that thing, every now and then I beat that man
She tell a nigga not to say a thing, but I can't keep a secret man (It ain't easy bein' me)

[Hook]

Got money out the asshole, the money on my head
Don't mean nothing, I said don't mean nothing
The Rosé in the Rover, I'm drinking and I'm driving
That nigga try and get at me I'm pulling out and firing
To see if I'm stunting, the piece it ain't nothing
Royal fees ain't nothing, I just blow a little something
Now shorty got a thing for me, she feel like I'm the shit
My guess is I'm the kind of nigga she wanna be with

Get at me, I'm moving with the chrome
A made man, a Don Corleone
No matter where I'm at I'm doing what the fuck I want
I'm shining, my wrists all canary
Now try me, I keep a shooter near me
I'm grinding like I ain't made my first mil'
Like I ain't signed a first deal, like I ain't at the first meal
I'm hungry, I really want it all
Now watch me, I'll show you how to ball

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Life in the fast lane, fast car, fast cash

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me so you know she the shit
If I'm a star she a star, if I'm rich she rich
That's my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go, I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog
You know a bitch don't usually mean nothing to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful screaming ''I hate you''
She must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, with me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fucking with you

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya
(Could've been you)
Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind
(Could've been you)
Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
But you tripping while we sipping
In the back of the club big tipping

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
She say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby, you was confused
I had a thing for you, I had a ring for you
House, cars, kids and a pet name for you
Pussycat, told you I'd make it, you ain't believe
I guess cause coming up was hard it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fucking with you
It's on, the club jumping, I'm trying get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm staring at your thicker friends
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think, just think, that could've been you
Now just think that should've been you with me
I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fucking with you

[Hook: R.Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya
(Could've been you)
Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind
(Could've been you)
Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl, it's so
But you see us in the back of the club
Popping bottles and it could've been you, but nope

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Said it could've been - could've been you, yeah
Said it could've been - could've been you

Bricks you flipping, the whips you sitting

Punk niggas I'm sonnin' 'em, every chance I get
Man I know niggas is a trip, so I save all my grip
For these babies faggots flippin', dial 1-800-TIPS
Force me to bury the bricks, and the whips and take trips
Every word that come out of my mouth, I mean it, you could eat
Cause when I stick you, you gon' cough it up like you bulimic
I'm no magician, but I could make, somethin' outta nothin'
Like turn an empty block, into a crack spot that's pumping
So all you niggas out there, thinking you the nicest

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Columbian girl, Peruvian chick

A little like a pimp, I'm your pusher man
She could make us both rich nigga, yes, she can
You want your own spot, let's talk locations
Then talk market and the public relations

[Bridge: Robin Thicke](50 Cent)
Everybody's watching
But no one talks about it (shut your mouth)
Right now - that's all it was, anything call it
She said ''sex just ain't the same without it''

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Every little step I take (come on) you will be there
Every little step I make (look, bitch) we'll be together

[Hayes]
While rubbing elbows in the hills of high society
I look back on my life and realized the hood lied to me
Built the bullshit sense of pride inside of me
On a rise to fly car hating on varieties

[50 Cent]
Look, I don’t need no bitch niggas surrounding me
Get caught, you better stick to the codes that you provided, b
If you don't plead the 5th you get your whole shit split
So called kingpins get real money to snitch

[Hayes]
I know it sound hard to believe this bullshit
But sometimes you need money to see who you cool with
See niggas hustle hard and cop them a few whips
They end up popping niggas they used to be cool with

[50 Cent]
I’m a street entrepreneur, condo, connoisseur
Furs, suede, my car’s the core
Nigga I been a boss I employed my boys
And show em a bunch of shit they never seen before

[Hook - 50 Cent]
I got a business mind
That block is mine, that brick and them Glocks is mine
I got a business mind
That drop is mine, these knots and this watch is mine
I got a business mind
You can’t stop my shine
A nigga got a World Guiness book grind
I got a business mind
And I pop my 9, fuck around find out in time

[50 Cent]
I got a short fuse so if by some chance I get annoyed
The button gets pressed and your life gets destroyed
Got niggas that'll do the shit just cause they bored
Man I ain’t even gotta tell niggas what for

[Hayes]
You think you cool but I swat your type of fly
Yeah you crossed your T's but you forgot your I's
That’s why I out-charisma ya, I could out-business ya
Intimidate ya with success, I catch the interest of

[50 Cent]
Corporate America gangstas we got em tearing up
We only want the money, no reason to be scared of us
We feel the life that we live is unfair to us
America’s an oven, you got to break bread for us

[Hayes]
Go hard or die soft is what was said to us
So if it’s gunplay you gon get shot instead of us
Crackers be thinking they one step ahead of us
I say shit like that to let em know that I’m aware of it

[50 Cent]
We keep accountants to count, I got lawyers to share, kid
Babes to clean up my mess, go make the bed bitch
They said death or jail is what’s ahead of us
So when they ask me what I thought, all I could say is I'm a

[Hayes]
Street entrepreneur, condo, connoisseur
Fur or suede, my car’s the core
Nigga I’ve been a boss I employed my boys
Matter fact, I don't even wanna chat no more

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Girl I want you to give me what you got then give me more

Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call the Hennessy thug
Passion you're laughin, I'll make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shorty that's what I'mma get for ya

Make it rain, trick, make it rain

Off the chain, nigga I ain’t playin'

This what happen when a bebe kid
Blow up, I'm on out this bitch

[Hook]
I ball out bottles after bottles 'till I fall out
I stunt, I do it my way
I'm on now, get my money long now
Looky here, nigga, you ain't got it like me
If you don't like me
(Get busy, get busy)
Do something
If you don't like me
(Get busy, get busy)
Do something
(Get busy, get busy)

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
Tell me why you don't like me, my chain too icy
The diamonds on my Breitling striking like lightning
Throwing cake on your wifey, she licking the icing
And uht's not even my birthday
She telling me she love me, I don't wanna be her pimp
Plus your ass ain't 'sposed to be here in the first place
Nah, dance the Ali Key, let me hold some
Look Nigga, cause I know you I don't owe ya nothin'
With your broke ass, cold ass
Type of nigga gonna get wild with no mask
Rider gang thing play the bitch and watch us ball
It's my night, boy, better love 'till mor'
I'm a boss plus walking big balling
Shit talking, Benz parking, rims glosing, clique flossing
Tell the waitress drain the bottles with the towels sparkling
They say money talk, nigga my shit hawking

[Hook]



[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Ayo, what's up, it's 50 Cent
It's Murda Mixtape Vol. 3
Whoo Kid, Stretch Armstrong, nigga
Take that

[Verse 1]
Niggas don't wanna see 50 on a track
I got these cats that rap scared of me like I'm Haitian Jack
Fuck that, if I was you, I'd be scared of me too
Yo Stretch, roll the weed while I tell 'em what I need
I need cream by the stacks, shells for the Mac
Rims for the 'Ac and a bitch to blow her back
I need the coke to come back, mad time on a jack
I got the Fendi sweaters, all I need is the hats
I need the police to chill, stay the fuck off my back
See a nigga in a Benz, swear he peddling crack
I need a stash box, dunn, so I could stash the gat
I need a stadium light to leave 'em blind as a bat
Flipping from under my plate while I'm running from Jake
I make no mistakes, look I need extra papes
My man up North, need the new Stretch mixtape
I'm physically fit -- nah, for real, son, I'm in shape
I need that Beyonce bitch to take me out on a date
Niggas follow my footsteps cause everything I say is slick
But I need y'all niggas to get off my dick
My description in three words ''real witty cat''
I'm in the club in ATL, I'm where the titties at
What, what, 50 Cent nigga, 2000 shit, Stretch Armstrong
Whoo Kid, nigga, Whoo Kid, nigga, Whoo Kid, nigga
What, Whoo Kid nigga, this how it's going down



[Hook]
I left a message by your door, got a chrome .44
Get the message, come out and get the message
It won't even be a war, no beef no more
Get the message, come out and get my message

[Verse 1]
I was a itty-bitty nigga when Prince killed Drake
I'm a shooter, ask Bizzy, he made us that way
I spend seven-and-a-half hours bagging up grams
Gotta watch these niggas with the sticky-ass hands
See my face, do a hundred grams chopped on the mirror
Tell me I can't eat, I ain't trying to hear it
JoJo wanted the bitches, I was trying to get my weight up
Nigga get in the way and get shot down, straight up
I'm grimy, yeah, my friends killed my friends
Like Blackey, he did that shit to him
Get at me, I'm back strapped up again
I tried, I can't change, I'll always be the same
I tell my little niggas fuck 'Preme
And any motherfucker down with 'em can suck me - I'm still mad
I got the cream to make a murder scene
If y'all niggas ain't shooting y'all can't fuck with me, come fuck with me

[Hook]
I left a message by your door, got a chrome .44
Get the message, come out and get the message
It won't even be a war, no beef no more
Get the message, come out and get my message

[Verse 2]
The D's kick my door, got knocked with a half a brick
I came on the nuts, son, niggas ain't give me shit
I tried being cool, that cool shit don't work for me
I put my gun in your face, you hear my ass perfectly
You can't park 'round here while I'm down here
I shot Chris whip up, he came back shot Richie head
But that ain't who he aim for, get who you came for
Apollo, amateur night, your name is in lights
I don't clown, I get down, I'm a different breed
Yeah, wait until these jokers get a load of me
I watch your clique like a flick, find your backbone
Line 'em up nice, come through with the Mac blowin'
Beef ain't nothin new to me, it's all a repeat
I leave a shooter by your door to make your ass leak
Now come out come out, find out what I'm about
That Ruger, that luger, I air your ass out

[Hook]
I left a message by your door, got a chrome .44
Get the message, come out and get the message
It won't even be a war, no beef no more
Get the message, come out and get my message



* the opening begins at the end of the previous track "Get Low"

(This, is.. an exclusive, remix)
[Eminem] Remix!

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm tryin to catch me somethin
A little jux or somethin

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly

[Verse One]
You wan' spray at me go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your lil' sister callin me stupid, reason why
Her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new cig in that ol' 38
I be schemin to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watch and dress shirts, stomp through a hole in the cake
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really want it you pussy? Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just wreak with marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH

[Hook]

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse Two]
Who's that peepin in my window?
WOW - the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleepin, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screamin fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waitin to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doin me, back out on the spree
Catch me and niggas slippin out pumpin that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt, but a nigga low-key

[Hook]

[Hook]
I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up

[Verse 1]
I was a real bum now I'm really rich, kid

The Rolls, the roof gone, your flows, they're lukewarm
It's why you're not me; nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Bottle after bottle by the bar, I be stunting
It's Gucci this, Gucci that, Gucci hat
Big doofy gat, hit you in your kufi hat
You know me, I told your ass in '03 "Get Rich or Die"
G-5 I fly, write my name in the sky
Pick an island on the map, I been to it
Shorty wanna try anal, her friends do it
Wrists rocked up shining, flawless diamonds
You could hardly see the face on my Audemar time and
On that J.T. shit, me I'm bringing sexy back
Louis belt wrapped around right where the TEC be at

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Getting paper's my objective, yup, now your chain gone
One false move and clap, now your brain's gone
You like me, you aight with me; me? I'm into me
I destroy my enemies even if they're kin to me
Do 'em like the Kennedy's, ching-ching that's mo' bread
Say something slick out your mouth I'll come for your head
She likes me more than you can imagine
Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
Closest I'mma get to heaven in this lifetime
Is right below her waist in between her thighs
Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her
See when I stunt she stunt, we stunt together
Oh, you don't like how that sound? Aw nigga whatever
We both rock Bugarri, both push Ferrari's
I go so hard in the paint, I'm sorry

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You want me? I want you - plug one? Plug two
I'm infinitely special, girl
The Lord's gonna bless you if you do what I tell you to do
You want me? I want you - you want a Benz? I'll buy two
You should want me like you want success
Girl, with us together we'll be better than the best
Why settle for less?

[Hook]

[Intro - 50 Cent talking]
Uh, yeah, G-Unit, uh, yeah 50 Cent, uh, yo

[Chorus 1 - 50 Cent, imitating Timbaland]
Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already
Now here we go

(*harmonizing over the beat - doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) (Pee Wee Herman)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Niggas look down to Pee Wee Herman)

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggas love me, like they think our mics on (WOO)
These rap niggas not like me, they too soft (yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (uh huh)
Real niggas snatch Glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and Glocks in palm (uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (god damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggas names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line, and get layed out

[50 Cent - Chorus 2]
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hoes again, cause I did that already
Now here we go

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 2]
(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me thats my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at IHOP (yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King
(*harmonizing of "doo, doo" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) "Life After Death" and that 2Pac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole day I’m passing the green
Thats how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking)
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude)

(*50 Cent - harmonizing "doo,doo,doo"*]

*beat stops

[Lloyd Banks]
What the fuck happen to the rest of the beat man?

(50 Cent laughing)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I make it hotter,  friction turns to fire
You're what I desire, I'm coming to get you, girl
That's right, that's right, it's on tonight
You're just my type, you're what I like
I bring that heat, you heard me right
Everywhere I go, go, let's go
Something new, it's another episode
Music bumping, sweat dripping on the danceflo'
I like it when shorty get to backing it back
When she do it like that, I don't know how to act

[Bridge]
Now work it
Go ahead grind it on me, that's perfect
I'll pay to play if it's worth it
My phone when you want me you can chirp it
Now get to work, kid

[Bridge: Young Buck]
Let me take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

[Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
Wel, if you want it let's go
I got that fire (So hot I burn it down)
Act like you already know
I got that fire (Cause I'm the flyest chick around)
You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I might ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the Fire Marshall come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed everytime I rock
These other niggas ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and 2Pac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent
Ghetto star by the bar I get you bent
You wanna party, let's party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna creep we can creep tell me where should we meet
So you can

[Bridge: Young Buck]
Take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

[Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
Wel, if you want it let's go
I got that fire (So hot I burn it down)
Act like you already know
I got that fire (Cause I'm the flyest chick around)
You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I might ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Now are you really ready
I said, are you really ready
I make the temperature rise, now don't be surprised
I have the ice on, stuntin heavy
I got a helluva flow, you should already know
Sold over 30 million records already
It's the third time around, you know how I get down
I'm hands down, pound for pound, the best around

[Bridge]
Now work it
Go ahead grind it on me, that's perfect
I'll pay to play if it's worth it
My phone when you want me you can chirp it
Now get to work, kid



[50 Cent]
Yeah, 50, Olivia
We both think alike

[Olivia]
We both think alike, uh-oh!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Now shorty we can party 'till the break of dawn
(We both think alike, uh-oh!)
Go 'head 'till ya tired than I'll take ya home
(We both think alike, hell yeah!)
If you invite me in I'll come take it off
(We both think alike, uh-oh!)
Than head to ya bedroom to break ya off
(We both think alike, uh-oh!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm not gon' waste ya time talkin 'bout shit that you know
I'm so hood that even when I try to hide it, it shows
I be grindin' girl I'm focused, I be gettin' my dough
You know that If It ain't the flow, than it comes from the O's
Plus a nigga like a pimp when it comes to the hoes
Every hood, every city all the gangsta's now
Front on me, and you'll be gettin' hit up fa sho
I make it hot when it's twenty muthafuckin' below
See wit' me in VIP you can twist and blow
When the champagne finished baby, order some mo'
Keep a eye on you close while you out on the floor
Doin ya move will have a nigga's greased if it's a swole
If ya ready to roll shorty, we can just roll
When you ready to go, I'll be ready to go
See everything I do, I do on the low
So anything we do, nobody will know

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now look, I know you into the shiny things
The platinum, the chains, and the diamond rings
The twenty-four inch chrome on the range
I see you when you crouch by ya window pane
Now shorty, me and you we came up the same
The fact before rap, I ain't have a thing
I hustled, got my weight up, now I'm sittin on change
I mean I got money out the ass, maine
When niggas get the beefin', I be laughin'
Cause I can send my homies through to blast them
Stick 'em with the hump, or just slash 'em
"Now fool are you crazy?" Is what we ask 'em
But back to me and you shorty, decide, think
First I'll put the burnin', it's the g-string (uh-oh!)
Leave it up to me, we can do it my way (uh-oh!)
And get straight to it, skip the fore play (uh-oh!)

[Hook]



[Intro]
[Girl singing]
You, I love you so much
I can't deny how much I love you, yeah
[50 Cent]
Alright, alright, that's enough
Niggas ain't gonna hear that shit

[Verse 1]
Nigga this is simple, not complicated
I-I-I can't be faded
I'm starting to think I made it
Get out of line, out line, line, out line
You act like you got a vagina, you pussy nigga
Front on me, I'll find, find, I'll find ya
There's no running from me
Picture me in my darkest hour
I would rather be marked for death than marked the coward
Pure evil, like the dope in your veins
You fuck around I make you bang yourself like Cobain
Turn around disappear, thin air like David Blaine
I’m higher than Travolta, he flyin' a plane
No evaluation necessary, I'm insane
The barrel of that llama, hot, yeah, like a sauna
Bricks in the door panel crossing the Verrazano
Tom Ford Taylor shoes, you’s Ferragamo
Don Corleone, let's talk mano-a-mano
I’m classically trained, they call me the piano man
I move the keys fuck a piano, man
I'm sort of like a one man band with a trumpet
Beef – I let blow, run, hop a fence, and dump it
Niggas be talking all that jazz
When they get down to the get down they ask
That bass so deep, my heart so cold
I let you hear that street sweeper drum line row

[Hook]
Rat-a-tat tat, rat-a-tat tat tat tat, I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
You lose, cause I got the ill street blues
You lose, I'll see you on the 6 o'clock news
Rat-a-tat tat, rat-a-tat tat tat tat, I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
You lose, cause I got the ill street blues
You lose, I'll see you on the 6 o'clock news

[Verse 2]
This vintage 50 call it my tommy gun bounce
Say the wrong shit out your mouth I'll A your ass out
One line, one bar, I'll be on you so fast
My night work like I'm fresh out Alcatraz
I don't wanna play so I don't play fair
You know it's not polite to stare at my Cartier
Yeah, I'm enjoying the fruits of my labor
Coke boy, the dope boy, now a nigga major
I used to cut crack on my grandmama China
And cook coke think I'm the chef from Elle's Diner
Smoke it, I could smoke a kush through the jar
When I'm tripping, I might put a clip through your car
They say I'm sick, then tell me how I made it this far
I love war, in fact, I'm the commander
I want you to open the box of pandor'
I'll destroy you and everything you stand for

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm a South-side nigga to the bone
And when my niggas ain't around, I do it on my own
Check my track record nigga, haha, 50 yeah
That's cool for starters, but we gotta get to the shit
Wait till y'all hear the shit



[Intro: 50 Cent] & (Jeremih)
Give it to em (give it to em) [x4]

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Don’t do much talking, I just check ‘em with the D
Got ’bout 3, 4 bad, bad bitches in the tub waiting for me
My favorite ho's imported, her name Elize
And she say she got a man, she can’t stand that he’s a zero

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Bitch, I’m the man, I love bubbling
Shorty touch ya, touch ya hands all, all over me
Yeah, no-one will believe
I can get you high as NASA, careful with ya asses

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih] & (50 Cent)
I only want em bad (give it to ‘em)
Whatever's on tab (give it to em)
I’mma spend a little more change at the bar
Tell the DJ to run it back (give it to em)
I'mma give it to em, give it to em (give it to em)
Give it to em, give it to em, give it to em (give it to em) [x3]

[Hook: 50 Cent]
50 Cent got that shit that'll make them (girls go wild, girls go wild)
My shit knock in the club and it make them (girls go wild, girls go wild)
From the front to the back let me kick it (girls go wild, girls go wild)
I got them macking like they rocking to my old shit (girls go wild, girls go wild)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
She want me to trick, I think this pussy one for me
She seen my watch and all the rocks on top of my new pinky ring
Oh, understand I’m out here in these street
Get out of line tryin’ to take mine, I get at you with the heat, boy
Girl, my swag is illsy
Flip a row of Cavalli frames, I blew a couple G’s
Shorty bad, I bet ya she’s a freak
She might bring a friend if she want something to eat

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Smoke purple shit and it slow me down, down, down
I sip brown shit ’till my head spin round, round, round
Shorty says she wants me, you know what’s up
Might pop a pill before we fuck
Basically we all turned up, all the way turned up
First it’s "Fifty, you know you so strong"
Than it’s "Tell me how you go so long?"
"Non-stop, please can we take a break"
She said “I need water, I need water”
I don’t need no crowd round when I’m performing
No TV, no lights, no camcorder
I let the world know I’m a bedroom star
Ya boy a freak, I always go hard

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook x2]



[Intro]
I really hate havin’ to resort to knockin’ elderly people in the head for their money
But I do it, I do it
Yea, you know I do it
I’ll do it, I’ll do it
Yep, you know I’ll do it
I like gettin' high

[Hook- 50 Cent (Kidd Kidd)]
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(Nigga I’m high as a motherfucker)
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(Ain’t not a nigga brother come tell me nothin’)

I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(I’ll make your bitch come smoke with me)
I roll the shit, I roll the shit
(That’s why you bitch gon roll with me)

My Bentley Coupe ain't got no top
It’s high but I’m checkin’ my AP
If I shine let’s room
Bitch you wanna roll?
Nigga, you must be crazy

I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit

[50 Cent- Verse 1]
Hey Slim, hey Shady look what you done did
Made a Southside nigga get a pocket full of bread
Got that Bentley Mulsanne to match that boat
Beige leather seats in it, they match that dope
Kush smoke same color to match that coat
I'm chin-chillin; Mo' spillin
Dom poppin, party rockin
My beat knockin, your bitch watchin
My feds clockin my shit
Threw a grand a piece on all of my kids
Get your ass whipped you step on my shit
Nigga you blink I'm all in yo' bitch
Put her in the club, teach her to turn trick
Jack'll be nimble, Jack'll cum quick
This pimp shit, break the paper off bitch
That shit fake, Audemars don't tick
Them ain't diamonds, what is this shit?
I'm confused, this bill don't go and pick
I'm a match that deal with my hat
They said I fell off, I snapped right back
Nigga my money can't fit in no safe
Got a mil' for e'ry lil' bump on yo' face
Tryin to count mine, I'm walkin up in the vault
Better have a pound if you niggas wan' smoke

[Hook- 50 Cent (Kidd Kidd)]
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(Nigga I’m high as a motherfucker)
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(Ain’t not a nigga brother come tell me nothin’)

I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(I’ll make your bitch come smoke with me)
I roll the shit, I roll the shit
(That’s why you bitch gon roll with me)

If I shine let’s room
Bitch you wanna roll?
Nigga, you must be crazy

I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit

[Kidd Kidd- Verse 2]
50 Cent, look what you damn did
Took a ’94 nigga from the hood, made him be
Now every ho want a kid from the Kidd Kidd
They tripped, slipped and fell on my dick
Give me brain like I ain't got no sense
I got change, dollars and lil' cents
I got rich, they ain't seen me since
Now it's all startin to make sense
I pull up in that brand new Benz
All of a sudden I’ve got brand new friends
Brand new chopper, bitch go blocka
BRRRRRT, like I just broke wind
(I roll the shit, I smoke the shit)
I forgot she was in my bed
(I roll the shit - I smoke the shit)
Damn! I blew through all my bread
That Lambo ain't got no top
Man, I'm hotter than a stove top
Rider Gang, we on top
And we havin a smoke-out
Eyes low but I'm so high
Don't ask me, I don't know why
I'll roll the shit and I'll smoke the shit
If I don't pass the shit don't task for shit, HUH!

[Hook- 50 Cent (Kidd Kidd)]
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(Nigga I’m high as a motherfucker)
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit
(Ain’t not a nigga brother come tell me nothin’)

I roll the shit, I smoke the shit

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Eminem]
Ay yo fif’ I was thinking you should go back to doing the shit you used to do

[50 Cent]
Murder them, murder them
They violate, I demonstrate
Yeah, I’ll murder them
Niggas be fronting word up
They stunting till they hurt up
That semi talk I’ll let it buck
I had these niggas running hard
I’ll pull a nigga’s skirt up and have him kicking dirt up
I’ll get a nigga an’ a nigga back up stupid hard
Silence it’s the return of the tyrant
Seein’ through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand closer to the homie you gon’ to die with
Flames come up out the muzzle wanting shit that I did
I’m talking like the feds ain’t listening
Nigga this is a pool of piranhas you’re fishing in
I give to a nigga if he want it
Better ask niggas about me I’ll be on it
I get to drop, blow out your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot out the cannon

[Hook]
It’s murder one, it’s premeditated
Murder, then it’s another one
Back to back, put work in
It’s murder one, it’s premeditated
Murder, then it’s another one
Back to back, put work in

You know I ain’t got the strap on me
Holding that for me

[Verse 2]
I’m f-cked up, it really doesn’t matter though
Hundred nine millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggas drop like dominoes
Run for your life, puta si vámonos
I was taught to see my crew a long time ago
Grew up around cocaine, yeah even my mamma know
I cut a O in the fo’ with seven at a time
Made four hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cindy Lauper bitch, time after time
A nigga shine like a nickel nine
I’ve been talking to the man in the mirror
Nigga so ass they was shaking like Shakira
It seems like my vision’s gettin’ clearer
See me coming with the hammer out, death is gettin near ya
It’s funny how niggas never hear ya, till you run down on ‘em
Gun down on ‘em

[Hook]
It’s murder one, it’s premeditated
Murder, then it’s another one
Back to back, put work in
It’s murder one, it’s premeditated
Murder, then it’s another one
Back to back, put work in

Yeah starting to feel like the old me (ha ha)



This is the Unit bitch

[50 Cent]
Nigga this is ground hog day
Back to buying coke
I’m ill, no Doc, no diagnosis
No cure, I smell fear

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
Nigga my eyes don’t cry, my heart so cold
Lets play, lets make a deal nigga, sell me your soul
Got a fetish for the guns, Calico drums
Rap Meyer Lansky steady counting my ones
Death dealer, Heron, meth dealer
Top biller, point blank, I’m that nigga
Barrell smokin’, fiend smokin’, rims cokin’
Out on that 550 Benz, bitch is open
Inhale, exhale, feel a different high
Andrew McQueen shirt and jeans, this a different fly
Presidential time, nigga watch the Rolie shine
No need for pens and paper, this here, whats on my mind

[Hook]
I know she wants a playboy
I don’t think you should fuck with me
I’m shooting right away boy
Find out when you run up on me
I’m riding with that K boy
I put that on my dead homies
I spray it right away boy
Find out when you run up on me

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
When niggas shot me, I must have bled out my conscience
Go ‘head play boy, I bang that thing at you like ronson
I feel for you niggas I’m back now
I told you niggas ’03 I don’t back down
Me still a rookie, nah, I’m more like veteran
I bet ya our part is full of niggas I’m better than
Magician I make rounds turn to cash, kush turn in to ash
Heads turn into ass, my bum nigga the class
Thats me in a nutshell, run tell I did it
Interrogation hours go on, I won't admit it
Got cash coming out of my ass, I’m so compelling
These niggas act hard till you hit ‘em, they start tellin’

[Hook]
I know she wants a playboy
I don’t think you should fuck with me
I’m shooting right away boy
Find out when you run up on me
I’m riding with that K boy
I put that on my dead homies
I spray it right away boy
Fiund out when you run up on me

[Intro: 50 Cent]
New York City!
You are now ridin'
With 50 Cent!
You gotta love it!

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the la
Catch stunts in my 745
You drive me crazy, shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask, and I
Hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Verse 2: Lil' Mo]
Cuz I just wanna chill and take a ride
Shotgun in your 7-45
Oh baby you know I got your back, and I need to feel you next to me
We got a baby and you know that I
Would have another, man I want your child
Sometimes I really wanna cry, cause the love is so good

[Hook 1: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down, and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Hook 2: Lil' Mo]
Boy, if you really love me now
Can we walk down the aisle?
Cause you know I'm gonna hold you down
Cause when you was down and out
I was still around
You gettin' money now, but I still got love for you

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there and support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof! and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could do what you like, I know you like that

[Verse 4: Lil' Mo]
If you fell off tomorrow, you could stay at my crib
If you didn't smell so good, I would still have your kid
If you got locked up, I'd put money on your books
I'd marry you through conjugal visits, and it'd be off the hook
You could still keep the hoopty, if you couldn't cop a Benz
Boy I'd never dip out, like some of your friends
If the boys try to get you, I'd be by your side
Like Cleo from Set it Off, and you know I'll ride
If you gotta peel a cap baby, do it papi
And if a chick wanna a piece of me, I know you got me
You have to work at Mickey D's or Burger King, I'd be there for you cause I kknow we gotta eat
I ain't got too many friends, you know that babe
If you use your tongue, baby I'll behave
You know I don't drink, cause I wanna have ur baby
Cause I'm your girl, and them other chicks is maybe

[Hook 1: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down, and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 5: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father, found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate, are you the one for me? Cause if so girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said "it wasn't me"
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

[Hook 1: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down, and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Hook 2: Lil' Mo]
Boy, if you really love me now
Can we walk down the aisle?
Cause you know I'm gonna hold you down
Cause when you was down and out
I was still around
You gettin' money now, but I still got love for you

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
If you only knew how I feel
Boy you would know that my love is for real
21 answers to the questions you got
I'll always love you if you got money or not

[Intro: 50 Cent]
This for the bitches, nigga
I'll, do, anything for you
I'll do anything you want me to (I'll do do do-do do do do)
I'll do, anything (anything for you)

[Verse 1]
Me? I done been around the world six times
A bad bitch in every part of the world's been mine
But you can change me, baby, you can change me
Oh shit, look, I'm already not the same, see?
Shorty, you make me feel brand new
I'm not running game, girl, I swear you do
You're too cold to hold and too hot to handle
Me and you girl there's nothing we can't do
You like girls, I like girls too, we got something in common
Now how the hell could that be a problem?
Shorty let's laugh, let's dance, let's drink, let's fuck
Right here, right now, shit, we only live once
I should not be reprimanded, I cannot be blamed
My lust on level 10, I'm trying to get it in
I'll have you cumming down your candy walls
Get it wetter than Niagara Falls 'til you climax, that's all

[Hook]
They think I'm a fool
Cause I'd do so many things for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
But they don't know the reason
It's why I do all the things I do for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
I'll do

[Verse 2]
I keep a bad bitch on deck
We retro drinking, yeah, sippin' Moët
Look man, my shawty got ass for days
I smack it, sit and watch it wave
When it's stress on my brain the head games relax the pain
So good I get to buying her things
Like tennis bracelets and chains, studs and diamond rings
I'm giving her the finer things
That's why she don't complain
I kinda got her open, mane, I stroke that thing
On different ends of the globe
We international now, whoa

[Hook]

They think I'm a fool
Cause I'd do so many things for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
But they don't know the reason
It's why I do all the things I do for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
I'll do

[Outro]
That's me and you, you know? (I'll do)
They ain't supposed to understand it (I'll do do do-do do do)
You know I say some shit I ain't supposed to say
But you know how I feel (I'll do)
I should be a asshole whenever I feel like it (I'll do)
After - look at the shit I bought you, man (I'll do do do-do do do)
C'mon man, don't give me no headache, man
You a bitch when you on your period, right? (I'll do)
Don't come at me with that bullshit, man
(I'll do, I'll do do do-do do do)
Do anything for you, girl
I'll do anything



[Intro]
Yeah, Shout out to Chris Lighty! Violator!
You know how I put it down when I put it down nigga, let's go!

[Hook]
When you frown at me is it because I won't provide for you girl
Your after me cheddar
And you friends they see it to screaming we know what your up to do girl
I'm after my cheddar

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I gave you your style Gucci this Fendi that
Burberry bag shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I ain't buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me parle with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo ass like I should
Now you reminisce about all the time I treated you good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
When you think about me grinding my fans
You either got more than one watch on or it's to much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So tash pull up stash the cannon linen
I'll never be your chofuer to the mall
You'll learn to appreciate cd's and posters on the wall
Fatal attractions is mad real
Last bitch I deaded got mad and swallowed 50 Advil's

[Hook]

Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
They say money make the world go round
Material things make a ho go down
I see you in your Prada Gucci and BCBG
Bitch I'm rich but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract
Now I got to double up in case the condom snap

[Outro]
Look don't ask me for shit man
I ain't got nothing for you man what?
Bitch what the fuck you mean I can't sing bitch
Bitch I'm Luther Vandross in the shower
G-UNIT!



[Skip]
Everytime I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen
Let me finish this brick, 'fore you put that fish in
Listen, I know we just came from fishin
But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all
You and all the trouble goin through by servin y'all
And only cause my man heard of y'all
Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

[Tony Yayo]
I went from oodles and noodles to lobster and shrimp
I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob
I'm still on the strip, tryin to get my grims off
Nigga tryin to flip and its a Mexican stand off
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil
Dressed in all black, lookin for souls to steal

[Hook] - 2X
Little bit of dust, little bit of cocaine
Little bit of dro, little bit of heroine
A little bit of ecstacy
That's why your bitch want to be next to me
We sell a little bit a everything

[Young Buck]
I put the two Mags, up to your doo rag
And rockaby baby, I'm in the blue Jag with new tags, in case you wanna chase
I never knew that, the impact, comin up out a Desert Eagle
A make a nigga wob and wiggle screamin call my people
We got these fiends pourin liters, and they shootin needles
Need to be takin your connection, cause we got it cheaper
Shit I ain't new to this, I met this air stewardess
Who knows the ins and outs on how to get it in and out, nigga

[Lloyd Banks]
Ya if I put a dress code all black, nine hows and a laser
And the party is an ink pen, bottle, or a razor
Your hollerin for praise ya, catch me in the hood with a model named Taysha
And the swallow game major
These cowards ain't gangsta, they tellin you lies by sellin you dreams
And they ain't fill ins, they fiends
Plus they rat, and it's too hot to chill in the sun
My pops 39 years old, and still on the run

[Hook]

[Juvenile]
Wodie what you want, you want dope, you want coke
Wodie what you want, you want X, you want dro
Shit you got beef, I got a tec and a fo'
You feelin' hot and moist, I even get you a ho
If you don't got no whip, I get you a car
If you don't got no skills, I get your some bars
My nigga we don't cut it, we serve it raw
Got anythin you want, play us awful hard

[50 Cent]
My 22's bling, so niggas scheme
745 I clean, digital scale nigga, fuck a triple beam
Coffee pot to cook coke, Joe to smoke, I was born to loc
Method cut the coke, 50 no joke
I ain't "Scarface", no women, no kids, I don't give a fuck
Better teach that bitch, and that little nigga to duck
With a P-90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya
If you survive you gonna feel what talent do to ya

[Hook]



Yeah nigga
We gonna smoke this motherfucker right here, right
We gonna smoke this shit
And I'mma drink a lot a water
And I'mma take Golden Seal, so my PO don't find out
I'm smoking this shit, aight?

Yo, niggas wouldn't rob Frankie if they had the chance
Wasn't cause of him it was cause of his man Lance
Frankie cut crack
Lance hold the Mac
If fiends fuck with Frankie's pac's
Lance cut the crack heads
He popped up
Thought he was locked up
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth
Coupe missin the roof
He like "What up, 50?"
I'm like "What up with you"
Lance had a reputation that was well earned
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn
Out there in Redfern
At the dice game, he rolled a headcrack in a crack
I'm like "Nah, I ain't paying for that! Nigga, shoot it back"
Niggas lookin at me like I'm crazy, they shook
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in Red Hook
Asked about BONE
Yeah, Bizzy was my man till he beat me for ten grand and sold my Mac for
Seven grand (Fuckin' crazy)
His man was thirsty, I could tell by his look
Cause he looked the way I look
When I look for a jooks
Bitch

Motherfucker
Teamwork, work hard nigga

Lloyd Banks

You know I got you
(X3)
(Come on Baby, Just kiss it for me)
(Just put it in your mouth)

[Verse 1:50 Cent]
She was hesitant at first
Said she never did it before
As soon as I got her going
She was going like a pro
She went up and down
Like a merry go round
And.. round and round
And SPLASH
She's freaky freaky
When you get her in the bed
You need.. g's like me to get her to give you head
My con-ver-sation is stim-u-lating
She in room ten-nineteen in the Hilton waitin
She got a thing for ballas
I mean a thing for balls
And I had turned her ass out
So im the one she calls
On the cheek she kiss me and she tell me she miss me
Ein' 'round me got her used to drinkin' don and cristy
I'm a special nigga
Look i'm used to blindin'
Keep that benz so clean and those spreewells shinin

(Chorus X3)

(can't be serious 4 in da mornin)
[Verse 2:Lloyd Banks]
Right in the mornin' I rolled over
Guess who was over my shoulder
A pretty round, round (round)
Who just got finished goin downtown
But at night with no lights
I have you wonderin
If it's a lightin bolt in your mouf
Or a glow-in-da-dark tongue ring
Banks needa ghetto chick
Set a nigga up wit ass
Sneak around till he fall asleep
Diggin in his stash
Leave with everythin
Rob a benz, stacks and da grass
Ass so fat, she get handclaps when she pass
I ain't never had a girl but you can be my bottom bitch
I'd been around da world
We don't hit no kinda chicks
Range rover, neva sober, hennessey, vanilla soda
B-A-N-K dolla' sign bitch
I ain't here hopin that your baby daddy ova da shoulder
Banks don't associate wit no TRICKS
I'ma make it a G-Unit party
From the hotel lobby
And if you ain't tryin to freak off
Then go home BITCH

(CHORUS) (X3)

[Verse 3:Young Buck]
You know what I came to do
Let you put your lips on my dick
But don't tell nobody
You my mistress bitch
All your friends keep tellin' you what to do
When you get me
Got to eat the nuts first
Like a hershey kisses
Bitch show me you miss me
Like I'm Pac or Biggie
She can be small as Eve
Or even big as Missy
I like it when them dikes
Endorage you ROUTE 6
Suck off thanks to 50 & B-Light, UNIT
Get your ass SUPLEXED
Tellin me to go down
I'm a P-I-M-P bitch

Baby girl slow down
You make a nigga cum quick
When you closed your eyes
And make your tongue
Do a twist
You my 3 o'clock, lolipop
Kiss the last drop bitch
Walk around naked ho

She finally found out
What young buck is 'bout
So give a nigga from the south
Some of that mouth

(CHORUS X3)

(come on girl, you know i got you)
Alright then you playas

[50 Cent]
You can hum all you want to

You like the smiles n the dimples on my face
BITCH that's a bullet wound I ain't MASE!
50 Cent skip the bullshit, you fuckin' tonight

But I ain't gon' lie I'll punch a bitch in the eye
Look, don't play games with me baby

[Beat Changes]

[50 Cent]
If I make it to heaven
I'll probably be in the bitch lonely
Walk around saying, 'Everybody in hell know me'
You heard of Banks, you heard of Yayo, them niggas my homies
You probably thinking how he get there
That nigga my co-d
The weather in hell is kinda hot
You know like the block
I heard it really burns
Homie, you know like a shot
That's alright for me shit
Cause Im in the drop
Drive around heavy
Tryna find BIG and PAC
Niggas think when they die
All they problems stop
You die in jail, and wake up in hell
Still on lock
Imagine if you stole something and you got shot
Wake up holdin' your head, still shot
Niggas don' died of AIDS
You know the dirty dick
Wake up in hell horny
Fidna fuck the same bitch
DAMN

Yeah, who hotta than me, nigga AAAAAH
The only nigga hotter than me
Dead already nigga
I know what you thinkin
You thinkin that's it
Yeah nigga let's just keep it short and sweet
You know!



[Intro: Dr Dre and 50 Cent]
Ha ha
I'm back, bastards!
(Oh yeah)
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
(Feels good)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my cds drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track-star, running through life, chasing my dream
Best deal I made was trading the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinking is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A old G told me God's favorites have a hard time
You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me

[Verse 2: 2pac]
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's starting to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater watching the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right
I ain't slowing down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself

Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me

[Hook]
Call it puppy love, Curtis and Tisha in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

[Verse 1]
She was pregenant by me once, glad she didn't have it
Cause I be paying child support now god damn it
Tish was my bitch, 'til she fucked my god brother
I was heated when I heard, wanted to go upside his head
It was christmas I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid
I was sick to my stomach nigga this is real shit
I ain't the sensitive type, I ain't sit' around crying
I caught the bitch on the avenue and punched her in the eye

[Hook]
Call it puppy love, Curtis and Janelle in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

[Verse 2]
D's came locked my ass up like a savage
Then came Doobie in the baby carriage
Imagine how it felt summerday pretty blue skies
I gased memorizied at her in with green eyes
I'm so into you baby we don't even got touch
That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck
Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby spot in forty
Sold crack before rap so everbody know me
Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me
Vick's spinning, Cheek's was the hottest rapper in the hood
I ain't hate, but on the low I didn't think he was good
We wore timberland boots, carhartt suits
You can tell a nigga paid, when his filas shoes suede
Rock a ceaser or a fade kept a pistol or a blade
Try to flip a 62 like every couple days
I get knocked I come home it's all a part of the game
Catch a snitch, cut a snitch or put one in his frame
It's like every other summer I was back and forth to jail
Telling nanna Im copping out, so i don't need bail
Just the convesary put the money orders in the mail

[Hook]
Call it puppy love, Curtis and Deawn in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Call it puppy love
Call it puppy love

[Verse 3]
She came to see me on the alley, wrote me letters all the time
And i responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind
Told myself I'mma grind
As soon as I get out that paper what im about
After 4 months home I had the Lan I shine
2 months later I copped the benz my nine
Stay all cocked even when it's hot, TAZ out
TNT on the block, make yourself get knocked
I just love 'em and leave 'em, I don't give a fuck
I mean she didn't give a fuck, she had a nigga in my truck

[Hook]
Call it puppy love, Curtis and Shaniqua in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G



[Hook: Ned the Wino]
Move the fuck out the way
This might get rain today
Don't wanna play now
I'm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Look at the bed you made
And lay down

[Bridge 1: 50 Cent]
Nigga better watch what the fuck you say to me
Tricks are for kids don't play with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
Got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
Problem nigga, it's ok with me
The revolver always stay with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Nigga that was my mama crack spot
I got birth rights
I lay a nigga out on the turf nice
Fuck a fist fight
Shit shift all of sudden, you can box my box cutter as I can see it cutting
Lord have mercy, jesus, lord have mercy
I bet this hurt you like it hurts me (it hurts)
Hot as hell when that gunpowder burning
What goes around don't come around
When I'm putting work in
Nigga swallow your pride and run
You stick around you're done

[Hook: Ned the Wino]
Move the fuck out the way
This might get rain today
Don't wanna play now
I'm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Look at the bed you made
And lay down

[Bridge 2: 50 Cent]
I don't know you, what the fuck you wanna say to me
I'm telling you niggas don't play with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
Got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
Body on the ground, it's OK with me
I make examples so niggas don't play with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I got a gun fetish, choppa in the trunk
I shoot a duck flying right out the sky with the punk
A nigga 8 out of 8 of moving targets
16 in the clip, I dump 'em all in your whip
You think I'm joking I'm not
Find out when that Glock get to dumping
And your back get hot
I got a temper, you don't wanna test my patience
And end up doc's new patient
Stump your head on the pavement
You try come at me on some brave shit

[Hook: Ned the Wino]
Move the fuck out the way
This might get rain today
Don't wanna play now
I'm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Look at the bed you made
And lay down

[Intro]
Nigga I ain’t fucking around
SMS, get the message, get the message!
SMS, get the message!

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
I go hard full time, duck when I pull mine
I run from one time, fuck a pig, ya dig?
I go to war with one nine
I work, you see mine
But I ain’t never ever gonna say I did it
In a hoopty, hoody on, cruising the back locks
You stuntin’ on hungry niggas, go ahead get your ass shot
Your neck got your chain on it
Bullet got your name on it
I’m serious, sometimes it seems like I’m playin’
Dump a shell case in your face, The DA’s coming for me
They tryna find a rat or call it a cold case
I know some niggas, some snitches
I know some bitches who’s scared
I got some shooters around me and they stay fully prepared
We got them straps you niggas look at and flinch
Ghetto nigga get rich, what you think I’ma get?
We got that pump in that chopper, we got the tech in that sweeper
We got that Ruger that Mac, I call it my bitch nigga ether

[Hook]
All we do is get that grain
And my niggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang
I’m talking ’bout the Unit gang

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Inhale! Smell the gunpowder, my hands is full of residue
Niggas’ll shoot niggas, you lucky it weren’t you
Nigga, my vest on, my chucks are bomb proof
You shoot, I shoot back, find God when I’m on you
This ain't tales of the crypt, nigga, this tales of the hood
Stay the fuck out the way with your mouth shut like you should!
When the bullshit start I’mma find a spot
Aim it right at your knot than the shell cases’ll drop
Man, you niggas don’t know me, you know my government name
Go ‘head ask about booboo, they tell you I let it bang
Got a big reputation, there’s something wrong with my brain
Nigga front, I’mma squeeze it, go ‘head stunt, I’m squeeze it

[Hook]
All we do is get that grain
And my niggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang
I’m talking ’bout the Unit gang

[50 Cent]

It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right
It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right
Everybody know that

[Verse 1]

Doin' good in front of niggas in the hood cause problems
Trey-eights, trey-pounds and .44's solve 'em
I hate when hoes get on some loudmouth shit
Your man gangsta? Me too
Go on and get 'em bitch
I just bought new toast to spit
Next nigga gettin gully gettin' laid out quick
Where ever rich touchin' niggas is gettin hurt
Cause a broke nigga always down to put it in work
Don't run up on me, I don't know you nigga
So what you bought my cd, I don't owe you nigga
I know you love the way the goutti beat bump
Got you license plate rattlin' all over your trunk
I confuse these chumps with my style, yo
I'm from Queens but I'm mother fuckin BK hard
I sound like I move bricks uptown
Or like a thug from the Bronx who stays with a 4-pound
Shook nigga (shook nigga, shook nigga)
I'm a Guiness Book nigga

[Hook 2x]

We don't play that pussy shit 'round here
You can get your fuckin wig split down here
Don't be reppin' where you come from too much around here
You can get your fuckin cap filt

Queens, nigga!
Brooklyn

[Verse 2]

If I can't get my gun in the club, why whould I come in the club?
So niggas I done stuck up could cut me he fuck up, nah
I'm outside to jump off in a Benz jeep
4 deep strapped with all kinds of heat
Niggas think they want beef
They don't want beef
They find out that somebody they love (is) layin' in the street
When you rap, you keep it gangsta dog it's all good
Just don't go poppin that shyit in the wrong hood
Where I'm from the young boy'll come and try ya nigga
Shell will make ya feel like your on fire nigga
If you thinkin we thirsty cuz, we right
We lookin at your watch and chain like that's an S-type
Promoter sayin "don't play 50 in the club"
Last time it came nigga tore the shyt up (what)
I don't where you from and I don't care
But nigga we don't play that pussy shit round here

[Hook 2x]

The only Spanish I know is "coño, cállate la boca puta",
"no inglés, no inglés" motherfuckers will shoot ya'
The Latin Kings don't like me, I don't care
We don't talk that "mira, mira" bullshit around here
Man, I done did so much dirt in the hood
Niggas heard I got shot they was all sayin 'good'. ("Good for him")
Fuck ya'll, ya' ain't got to like me
I'm gettin knocked, ya'll nigga ain't got to write me
I'm on the same bullshit I been on
It's the same bullshit ya' niggas need to get on
Y'all shit sound too commercial
Come cruisin' through the hood mother fuckers will hurt you
You should know when and when not to flash jewels
Cause niggas will run up on y'all fools and flash you
They want your money, the watch, and you tennis shoes
"I ain't gotta tell ya not to move
Ya know the rules!"

[Hook 1x]



Funk Flex
Yeah, G-Unit
You understand whats about to happen?
Huh .. huh? (do you understand?)

[Hook]
Nigga guess who's bizzack
It's not Beanie Sieg' or Jay-Hov'
50 Cent y'all niggas should know
Don't make me relapse
Run up on your ass with the fo'
You punk nigga I done told you before

[Verse]
Fuck being in a cage, man that shits for the birds
I do my dirt in the hood, but I live in the burbs
When you talk be careful how you choose your words
Cause I send niggas to put ya fuckin brains on the curb
Am I my brother's keeper? Yes I am
Nigga you know they gettin low you see that gun in my hand
G-Unit, don't go fuckin with my soldiers, boy
Get laid out, im'a say I told you boy
See you rollin with 20 niggas, we rolling with 20 guns
16 hollows is loaded in every one
I know you slow, so
I do the math thats 320 shells flyin at your ass (ha)
You spend a lot of time talkin about how you ball out
When u get hit you gonna run and bleed till u fall down
I guess you didn't think we was down to go all out
One second, you was wrong
You ain't on the shit we on
My money getting long
Now my team getting strong
I'm gone
Gone

[Hook]

[Outro]
50 Cent
And I'm back to act up so strap up
Funk Flex
Kingpin style
Ya heard me
C'mon, c'mon
Make me cut something
Make me bust something
C'mon, c'mon
I want you to
C'mon



[Verse 1]
They say I ain't lyrical, they say I ain't a miracle
I say some hard shit so they say I ain't spiritual
They act like they know God better than me
I know God Allah, he used to pump crack up the street
Allahu Akbar, clap him, run through your backyard
Let the Mac off, tear half off your back off
This is my block, my spot, I am here
I'm a South Side nigga 'till the bone, get that clear
Now I got a better hustle so I'm getting better bread
Buy my bitches better shit so they give me better head
You thinking about getting down with me, yeah, you better kid
Where the fuck you gon' get a job? You a predicate
Felon, it's back to crack sellin'
Nigga get caught telling the show, crack the melon
I told you I'd blow, now you see it to believe it
My head gassed up, man, I'm so conceited
Nigga, you ain't never gonna see me in the hood
Motherfuck that shit, nigga, I'm too good
Run tell niggas 50's bougie
You don't buy his CD's and don't go see his movies
He don't act like he used to in Juve'
He was on the medication, that nigga there loony

[Bridge]
Can it be I been away too long?
I mean way too long

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are



[Intro]
If a bitch don't like me
Somethin' wrong with the bitch (fuck that bitch)
Why... oh why... why... you wanna fuck with me now?
Yo Dave, that shit come with the game baby, the money, you know
Thats how the shit work, you know what I'm sayin'
They supposed to love me now baby
I'm doin' it now baby
Hahahaha

[Hook]
Girl, what makes you wanna fuck with me now?
I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
Is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
The money gonna make you sell your soul

[Verse One]
Whoa... if money's gonna make me slam these hoes... then alright
Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons
Talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope
You got a smile that only a fool would forget
And a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
There I was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
Buggin' cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
She wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
But on the sidewalk we ain't play games
We exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' "I know that nigga, he rich"
She think I got six whips cause me and my Man switch
Anyway, her name is CeCe
She said she go to BMCC
Push a '98 328 with chrome BBS
She said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
She liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
It's hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya
Type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
They into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls
These trick niggas fucked up, they done gave 'em the World
Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
Oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
Nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
Platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
That I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
Know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
Probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
Long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
It goes on and on and on and it don't stop

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
One thing you can always count on is change
And a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
Had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
Would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
Now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
While we on the 900 double R Hondas
Watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
While Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
All these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
You can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
Take 'em two at a time
Quick I get in they mind
Have 'em thinkin' they mine
Bust off then tell 'em "Bust a Uey, on mo' time"
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year
Got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here
C'mon... uh huh... c'mon

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fuck you bitch! leave me alone, walk on... get the fuck on...
Yo, Shorty... tell your friends ya'll ain't fuckin' with us...
Aww man... look... he ain't mean that shit...
C'mon thats just records... niggas is playin'...
We wasn't serious and shit...

[Hook]
This is how a gangsta sing the star spangled banner

Blue bandana, clip, banana
That nigga leaking, what the fuck you do, blood?
Red bandana, clip, banana
Big flashin’ ya clip, what the fuck you do, blood?

[Verse]
It’s the return of that gangsta gully shit
Black Northface, braids up under my black skully, bitch
I still feel chills when the narcs come
My little homie scrap with the .40
We come around there and spark something
Let off half a clip, make ya whip lean
You rock petty nigga shells
It hit ya make ya softer than whipped cream
Funny, things are never how shit seems
You going H.A.M., we like damn, we don’t really want it, man
Then pop right up on you, gun in hand
This southside, muthafuckas get smoked here
We’ll see if ya still tough when the smoke clears
We at the hospital waiting to see the folks yeah

[Hook]
Blue bandana, clip, banana
That nigga leaving, what the fuck you do, blood?
Red bandana, clip, banana
Big flashin’ ya clip, what the fuck you do, blood?

I just wanna remind ya niggas, I'll find ya niggas. It's 50. The architect. I build and destroy, boy.  Fuck with me if you wanna. Street king. SMS AUDIO



[Intro]
If he’s your number one, and he’s your everything
Why would you pick up the phone when I call to talk to me?

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
You know you won’t play with a nigga
I fly out to spend the day with a nigga
First flight, first seat and first class
First pair of Giuseppes, first Birkin bag
I’m Street King, so you’ll be fit for a king
When we step out on the scene it’s Alexander McQueen
It’s a ghetto fairy tale, I’ll be your night in shining armor
And retro Jordan’s, Giselle’s and a leather bomber
Bright lights, city life, I’ll show around New York a bit
From hot dogs and pretzels to the expensive shit
Cause we can shop till my nickname Saks Fifth
Madison Ave mindframe, baby I stack chips smile
Me cell phone’ll capture the moment
When your emotions start to shift
I’ma just shoot that over your brown eyes
To chocolate thighs
Make me wanna sing good lord
Is this Adam and Eve happening again?

[Hook]
We could get all day, all night, twisted up, get right
Let me know if you’re with it
That kush in my hood so good, roll it up, back wood
Can’t wait to let you hit it
Now you’re in my world
Now you’re in my world!
Planet Fifty

[Verse 2]
Listen shawty, this is my foreplay without the touching
You can say it’s my forté, I feel you coming
Mindsex I make you wanna take your clothes off
2020 golden Benz, I’m feeling that concept
I want the best, now can you be the best for me
Can my vision and your ambition make the perfect recipe
Let’s take a walk on the wild side and chat til your body language is saying, boy come get this cake
In my mind ten times, I done took off your clothes
So if you’re thinking what I’m thinking, let me know it’s a go
I’m a gambling man, talking ’bout life not dicing
And that look in your eyes say it’s going down tonight
You can show me what you’re into
As I get into, kissing, licking, switching positions
Acting like a nympho
Round after round, I show you how I put it down
Jet set, mile high club

[Hook]



[Intro]
Some niggas just wanna smoke
Some niggas wanna smoke niggas
Some niggas sell coke
Some niggas selling dope, nigga

We all hood, different pedigrees
Now ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check out my melody
You fuck around I catch a felony
Now ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check out my melody

[Hook]
Since a little nigga I been on my own, me I hold the chrome
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
That shorty shit is over now I'm grown, me I'm full blown
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga

[Verse 1]
I don't know if I'm worse when I'm rich or when I'm broke, nigga
Same attitude, you got it, go 'head smoke, nigga
I'm fucking with a blonde bitch, I got my own fragrance
Powered by 50, goddamn it, I think I made it
I tried to keep it basic, they wanna complicate shit
The feds on my phone, that's why I don't ever say shit
Portray being a friend to me and I'll make you a memory
That .40 Cali barrel get to smoking like a chimney
Niggas sick of pussy shit and me I'm just the remedy
'03 get rich, nigga, you remember me?
Shorty rock her hips she get to looking like an entree
Bad bitch, fat ass, bouncing it like Beyoncé
She saying "I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva"
I'mma fuck her and leave her, nigga, I don't need her
I was born alone, I die alone, I be in the zone
Bitches won't leave me alone now that my money long

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I pull the hammer out and spank niggas
I peep your style, you got sugar in your tank, nigga
Don't fucking wink at me
I blend in with the best of them, shooters and robbers
I'm on that Will.I.Am shit, I black your eye for bloggin'
What the fuck is the problem? Violence isn't the answer
I split your fucking head then get jammed up
Why did you call the cops? Why didn't you say I'm hot?
It's been six years I been here on top
You act like I'm a average nigga spitting a average flow
Fucking with average bitches like everywhere that I go
I'm not focused on hoes, I'm focusing on the dough
And I won't talk to you after my next album blow

[Hook]

[Outro]
Rest in peace to Michael Jackson
You niggas need me, man
I might have to start moonwalking
Couple dance moves and shit
Write me some shit, call it ''Billie Jean Is My Lover''
I'm back, nigga, why so quiet?
Niggas know it's summertime, I'm all over the place, nigga
And you know when you see me I'm strizzapped
Oh shit, nigga, y'all know I was gonna get on that shit, yeah

Yeah, I done smoked a couple pounds, but I ain't never inhale
Been in custody before, but never in jail
Baby, I love you like America, don't talk to me fly
But I promise you if you do, bitch, I'll black ya eye
See, the hood fucked up, I got a plan for the crisis
Bring the dope in on boats and lower cocaine prices
That's stage one of my plan to pass by depression
When everybody high who gives a fuck 'bout recession?
Imagine gas price is twenty dollars a gallon
D's catch a nigga and have walk to the island
My main aim's to take away pain
It's okay, get fucked up, man
Got that purple, roll that shit
Got that pill pop, now take that trip
Got the Hennessy, man, take that sip
The pain'll go away if you get higher than a motherfucker
And I know you think you know my style
Sursprise, nigga, I done changed it now
5 years, I'm the nigga you been hating on
December 9th I'mma give you what you waiting for
Before I Self Destruct, motherfucker

[Outro]
It's 50
I'm in Detroit right now

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's
Niggas'll clap, all that pack you
Either way your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Momma baby boy is a killa
Ain't it funny how them guns get to pop for the scrilla?
Four bodies at 19, man I love that little nigga
For 5 grand niggas'll air the strip out
For 10 grand niggas'll run up in your house
Have you ass tryna talk with a gun up in ya mouth
New York has taught niggas to get money Down South
But get knocked in the commonwealth, stake your ass out
Fuck the captain, fuck the sarge
Fuck the king's that's in charge, bitch

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's
Niggas'll clap, all that pack you
Either way your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
When my warriors come out and play, I'm Osirus
I eat, sleep, shit and catch niggaritis
And beat niggas down like the turtles on Riker's
I'm a cheap ass connect with some high ass prices
I've been totin'.fo-fo's and Mack-10's
Since Tim Dog was on raw, G ten
I'm the nigga on the strip that make feinds relapse
I'm the nigga on the strip that's a walking G pack

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's
Niggas'll clap, all that pack you
Either way your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I don't bash woman, but I'll throw a bitch in a sleeper
I been this way since Rakim was kicking a speaker
You can fly on holiday's like Christmas and Easter
The only way yellow ice is if you piss in the freezer
I'll put your partner in a case and park him off of pace
You suppose to be getting money, cheddar carpet off your face
I'm in the blaze, top runner in the race
Nike fanatic, spent spring summer [?]
Look what happened to Ma$e, I hope you see them same lighters
And my tape pound from me, put you on tubes and vitamins
I might've been slunked in the G-5 drunk and
Thumpin' the chronic one ridin' with the Thump Jiva
I'm on the run from marriage to rolling the carriage
To go with the average, give me someone established
I'm performing if they come with the carros
These bitches want my son in their carriage
But I don't wanna feel dumb and embrassed, bitch

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?

First it was the Glock going hand to hand
Then I got to moving the gram by gram
Your boy get bread, that’s without a doubt
One by one, I knocks them out

I get that paper nigga, I get that paper
Benz on chrome shoes, crib sitting on mad acres
If I don’t get it on this time, I’ll get it on the next flip
Ball blowing them bottles and creep off with the next bitch
It’s recreation all, when it’s nothing to do
Fuck up a hater or two, or send a nigga at you
Gem star will scratch you, you're not on my stature, you’re just a rapper
In fact, you’re a regular rapper
Say the wrong line and I’ll get your ass wrapped up
Bass line bumping, whole spot dumping
Like go on to my niggas, get the mossberg pumping
I blow bread nigga, heavy bread
It was rip to big now heavy dead
Now all the fat bitches ask if it was something…

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread

{*Lighter flick*}
{*Exhale*}
Yeah, this some good shit
Ooh, this feel like some Wu shit:
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
I make it pop, hit your homie, right next to you

[Hook]
Niggas say they like my old shit
So I'll give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care; it's old
Shit I could flip some old shit
No, I’ll give them some new shit
I’ll just use my old flow

Looky here motherfucker: I’m not playing
Look, look (x2)

[Verse 1]
What's up
It’s '011; why that Maybach a '06? (Huh?)
This nigga boo booed up with my old bitch
I put paper before hoes: thats why I’m so rich (Yeah!)
I paved the way, long dick, now we all fit (Chu-chu!)
Doc check my temperature: Why I’m so cold?
The hood left the left side of my chest froze
I’m more about pimpin', gettin' bank rolls
Sittin' watchin' them trickin' on them stank hoes (Make it rain)
We can share love like, Kanye and Khalifa
From runways in Milan, to big bags of reefer (Wooh!)
She alright for a night, but don’t keep her
Ask Nas, Kelis was the illest ether

[Hook]
Niggas say they like my old shit
So I'll give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care; it's old
Shit I could flip some old shit
No, I’ll give them some new shit
I’ll just use my old flow

Looky here motherfucker: I’m not playing
Look, look (x2)

[Verse 2]
My belt buckle YSL; my denim vintage
My AP all iced out; my shit authentic
My bread come in by the boat load; that's how I get it (Yeah)
The cops come, say: I ain't do it; you know I did it (Aah!)
I ain't trippin’, na-na-na-na I ain't trippin’
I am just putting the clip in
I ain't out the window lickin' bitch (Wooh!)
I am legend, I am lethal with the weapon
I am 50, I’m putting an end to niggas fuckin' with me (Uh)
Yeah, I am back, I am ruler with a iron fist
I am strapped, what y’all niggas going to do with this?
Wordplay all day, they say I got a gift
One shot from the fifth, niggas career shift

[Hook]
Niggas say they like my old shit
So I'll give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care; it's old
Shit I could flip some old shit
No, I’ll give them some new shit
I’ll just use my old flow

Looky here motherfucker: I’m not playing
Look, look (x2)

[Outro]
Yeah, it's 50, I'm back
You won't see me rolling around
Y'all niggas see me, you already know
Don't come and say: What's up
I don't fuck with you
Y'all know I don't fuck with y'all niggas
I'll smack a high-note out one of you niggas
It's business as usual
All we're going to do is get more money, more bread
You hear me?
Watch me though

Cocked to bust it and you’ll blast back

Before your ass end up in a casket

For that last tour nigga
Or I’ll really service your ass nigga...



[50 Cent]
50 Cent; Lloyd Banks!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move
Just give it up smooth (G-UNIT~!)
Motherfucker you move I'll flash my tool
And blast my tool (G-UNIT~!)
Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew (G-UNIT~!)

[Lloyd Banks]
I been a problem since the old days, pimps and gold caps
Now I'm in O.J. Simpson throwbacks
Y'all was wonderin where my ass been
Probably vacationin on South Beach gettin head like an aspirin
If you gassed, I can let the tec pound your ego
Or lock you in a closet with the West Nile mosquito
The press crowd in people, especially celebrities
I'm heavily shittin on any Tom Dick or Gregory
Nigga you better be strappin; they want you dead if you rappin
I'm tryin to cave your head and your back in
I'm gettin bread and relaxin, and attractin a fan base
Of females with e-mails and letters to fax in
In Vegas with a toaster and a blunt
And the hotel I'm checked in, got a rollercoaster in the front
I'mma post 'em when I stunt, the Sammy Sosa of the month
Better yet the whole season, nigga I'm still breathin
Even though my dollars are green
I rap for the kids that's too poor to waste eggs on Halloween
I'm gettin swallowed clean, my habits are good
Collectin all the karats I could
Slidin from a stash spot to conceal the torture
And a good silencer to make it sound like the Wheel of Fortune
All this careless talkin, cause I'm travelin and flossin
Havin a good time, and you havin a abortion
You sucker for love, gettin married and divorced then
Can't even afford the batteries for your Walkman
I'm out the hood, burnin Cali weed on Slausson
Where set trippin turn to tragedies and coffins
Look, I mean what I'm sayin, you schemin I'm sprayin
Your team end up layin, on the sofa screamin and prayin
Sayin, G-Unit niggas be rollin crazy, holdin 80's
Older ladies starin cause they starin in that gold Mercedes
Since 50 hooked up with Shady, now they tryin to book up and pay me
If you think I'm shook up you crazy, baby
The boy strapped two ninas
Smokin out a bag big enough to fit on vacuum cleaners
I wore a glove when I blazed you fatty, I ain't your baby daddy
She flippin, now he tryin to grab me out the navy Caddy
I ain't your ave-y, papa was a rolling stone
Stockin up to own a home, pocket full of loaded chrome
Drop and get a hold of dome, I know your motive homes
You mad, cause I'm fuckin half your Motorola phone
I'm swift with the women I'm good with my words
A lot of, niggas is hatin on what I deserve I'm hotter
Front if you want, end up on the curb in your Prada
And your mans runnin, ambulance comin
Another day another dollar, on the low from the Impala
I can have a six still in my shower, motherfucker~!

[Outro]
Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move
Just give it up smooth (G-UNIT~!)
Motherfucker you move I'll flash my tool
And blast my tool (G-UNIT~!)
Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew (G-UNIT~!)
I send a nigga that you thought you knew
To come through and put a hole in you (G-UNIT~!)

[50 Cent]
Lloyd Banks, ha ha!
50 Cent! I ain't even gotta work hard
Look at these niggas, ha ha ha
The fuck you gon' do now nigga!
You done had the same niggas in the background for a long time
Think they gangster, but goin back and forth to jail
Well jumpin the turnstile don't count nigga
HA HA HA HA~!



[Hook: 50 Cent]
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah, yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I took quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks
Coca-Cola came and bought it for billions, what the fuck?
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes, who the fuck cares?
I'm stanky rich, I'mma die trying to spend this shit
Southsides' up in in this bitch
Yeah, I smell like the vault, I used to sell dope
I did play the block, now I play on boats
In the south of France baby, Saint-Tropez
Get a tan, I'm already black, rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a river rat, shit, fuck the chitter chat
The baker, I bake the bread; the barber, I cut your head
The marksman, I spray the lead, blood clot, chop your leg
Do not fuck with the kid, I get busy with the Sig
I come where you live, ya dig?

[Hook: Eminem]
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
I, I get money, money I got (I Get It)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run this rap shit)
I, I get money, money I got (Now guess who's back)
I, I get money, money I got (You thought I left you)
I, I get money, money I got (Now why would I do that)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (One, Two, Three)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new though
I got rid of my old bitch, now I got new hoes
First it was the Benzo, now I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari, I'm sorry, I keep blowing up
They call me the cake man, the strawberry shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole clique break dance
Backspin, head spin, flatline, you're dead then
9 shells, Mac-10, "who wanna get it cracking?"
I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh, you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they calling me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they calling me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck, man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like bloaw, you like my style
Ha ha - I'm heading to the bank right now

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a Teflon Don, boy, I run New York
When I come outta court, yeah, I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (Yeah)
Whoa, hey (I run New York)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (Yeah, yeah)
Whoa, hey (I run New York) whoa
I get money, money I got
(I'm back on the streets, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm bringing the heat, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm on my grind)
Money I got, money I got
(Like all the time)
I get money, money I got
(Trying to stop my shine)
I get money, money I got
(I'll cock my 9, don't get outta line)
Money I got, money I got
(I said don't get outta line
I-I get it, I-I get it
Yeah, yeah)

You wanna smoke that? Go 'head, roll it, son
I don't give a fuck, man, smoke that shit, man
Or you can smoke crack if you wanna smoke crack
I don't give a fuck what you wanna do, man
Don't look to me to stop you, man
Yeah, I'm not gettin in the way

[Hookt]
Cash rules, I keep a shooter 'round me
Queens get the money, I have a nigga killed y'all (killed y'all)
Kill the hood, ask niggas 'bout me
Jesus, for the money, niggas'll go real hard (real hard)

[Verse 1]
You are now under my hypnosis
Summertime grind, come out with the toasters
I return like an animal ferocious
New money breeds, new enemies, nigga you know this
Another mil', another nigga sick
I got nothing but hard dick for your bitch to lick
I box unorthodox, southpaw, outlaw, bricks of raw
I'm out in the drought, I make the dope price soar
Shit cool 'til the mac out, run when it back out
A nigga finna blackout, better pray that bitch jam
It's in God's hands, it's all God plan
You mean even when a nigga gettin smoked, goddamn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I push my pen with passion, I'm the author of the struggle
When pain is a head crack, the sign of the devil
Trip' 6-6-6, I'm back on my bullshit
See clear through my third eye, it's gon' be a murder
Every summer, every winter, every spring
You think I'm bullshitting, I put that on everything
The shooting gon' stop right after the shit-talking
I was selling crack while Mike was moonwalking
20 off a pack, I stack, I can't call it
I blast ya like NASA, Jack, you outta orbit
I mean you outta order, you don't want me to send a nigga to you
So he could put some hot shit through you, do you?

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Yeah, I'm back, baby, I'm back
New shit, the drought over, new product
Yeah, man I can't fit in with these niggas, man
I mean niggas got mohawks, they wearing skinny jeans, man
I think these niggas is faggots, man, for real, man
They with the rainbow club, man
You think this shit is a fad? Come on, man
I think it's more than that, man
I think it's more than that
So if a nigga wear a dress you gon' put on a dress too?
Come on, man

[Hook]



[Intro]
I took a sip of the potion
Little SK, a little Goose, now I’m loose

[Verse 1]
Quest for the cheddar I bought shiny Beretta
I’m firing squad hard, you niggas should know better
Than to bump with Ferrari, district calamari
I kill like rebels in Warri, I’m sorry
I ball like I think I’m the Prince of Abu Dhabi
Black gold gush out the ground
Gun powder fly out the pound
I turn a clown smile upside down
That’s 3 time zones in my watch face
Still hard to tell time with diamonds all over my watch face
Twinkle like I’m outta space, I'm the big dipper
You a little dipper, pipe down little nigga
Nice wheels, but don’t talk money, that's what I'm about
I could fit your house inside my house
And your neighbours and ya yard, oh my God
This shit ain't about shit so I ain't gon’ go hard
Now kick push, kick push, get the fuck outta here, kick push

[Hook]
You’re now being hypnotised, close your eyes
And say 50′s my favourite, 50, 50's my favourite
I’m not the the one to play with, I mean what I say, bitch
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite
Still on that gutter shit, forever on that gutter shit
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite
I know you love that shit, real niggas be loving this
50′s my favourite, 50, 50′s my favourite

[Verse 2]
Oh shit, now a nigga floating
That Luger German, thats Kush burning
I’m Einstein on the grind, my wheels turning
I’m out in Cali
Not in Hollywood, Silicon valley
I’m bout to get rich, I mean real rich
I’m talking Facebook and Spotify type shit
I’m not a programmer, I use ghetto grammar
Slang, pussy, I’m strong as David Banner
The Hulk, my money come in bulk
And if this shit go bad I go back to the dope
Now pay attention to the murder I wrote
This my light shit, my heavy shit on the album
Lets get right, bitch

Yeah, nigga what?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You're now rocking with the livest
Beams on the lamas
New York's city's finest
Drug dealer's dream, red jag, rim shining
Four shooters riding in the trucks right behind us
It ain't my fault man, the hood made me grimy
I hustle, get my weight up
Them niggas got to move
Only the strong survive
The weak getting bent up

Niggas in the pens gon hear this and lose they mind
Come home possessed by the music, and use that nine
I was in Sean C crib when I wrote my first verse
Stuck niggas in front of Edgemere and let my gat burst
I ain't had no money then
I was in and out of cash
Wearing blue Nike Cortez from V.I.M's damn
Went to Eddie's for gold teeth
Thanks for the shines
Had on eight ball jackets to cover up the nines
Barrel link chains
[?] rings
Damn fools I rob em for like all kind of bling
This is not a fiction homeboy it's fact
Certain kings paint problem child on my back

One last deep breath

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I got a 16 shot Ruger, I got 16 cars

Ja, Joe and Jada they're fuckin' retards

You want I'll get ya shot
You're just open your coffin

Now when I'm out in London they say I'm so smart
I fired rounds from pounds I came up so hard

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
I'm tryin' to pray to the preacher man but he in new gators

And learned the dope game fast ask Bo-Diddly
Automatic Mossberg in the all white fur
Shotgun pellets out of snow white spur. [shot] {DAMN!}

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Yeah... 50 Cent, uh-huh
Governor, G-G-G-G-G-Unit~!

She ain't that chick from the burbs that's a stranger to drama
She that Uptown Girl with the cock persona
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo' sho' we belong together
And I wouldn't break her heart, my intentions are better
And I, shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the D's came she was down to hold the baretta
I got a thing for babygirls, me and her against the world

[Governor - singing]
We used to think the same schemes, with the same dreams in mind
10'll bring you back 20 if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker, with a plan to rule the world
But understandin her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore, to win she'd give her life
Or shoot to kill, to protect this life

[Hook: Governor]
The world will hear, what's really goin on, in my life - my life
The world will see, what was really down down, in my life - my life
If you only knew, the pain I feel; if you only could feel the streets is real
If they only knewwwwww, what's goin onnnnnnn, yeah~!

[50 Cent]
You're sunshine, your smile make my day
It's simple - your dimple your eyes
Your lips, your thighs, got me hypnotized
Communication's deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma
Materialistic; still a nigga want her
Consistantly missin her touch when she gone, uhh
She smell like Chanel, she feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail
I've been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider, I'm in heaven when I'm inside her
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck, "12 Play" in the deck
Fo'play correct, have her drippin wet
She looked in my eyes and say she like it but I know she love it
I just keep doin what I'm doin and think nuttin of it

[Hook] w/ ad libs

"STOP!!"

New Shit
Tony Yayo, 50 Cent c'mon

[HOOK: 50 Cent]
Bump Dat
Niggas try to stunt on my click
Then when I get on that shit
I bring it to 'em where they pump at
12 Gauge mashberg
No shell in the head
Before you put in work, you gotta pump that
You done hit a nigga with it and you runnin to polices
Come and take my advice, nigga, dump that
This is serious, these rap niggas, I'm just havin fun with it
50 Cent, nigga, Bump Dat

[50 Cent]
My son ask "Daddy why carry a gun, you ain't a cop"
Looked at him and said "Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot"
Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my Glock?
Show 'em the clip
Show 'em the beam
Show 'em how Daddy lean
In the convertible Jag
22 inch mags
For a high school drop out, shit, that ain't bag
I'm not a blood or a crip, I'm doing my own thang
G-UNIT
Shit, I done started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance
I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
Think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sun roof to light up your hood, man
Carlito ain't never seen Blanco comin'
But if he did .. you think he woulda started runnin?
And I move with the Doublemint Twins and two macs
And leave you flat your back
BRRAT
Take that

[HOOK]

[Tony Yayo]
I gotta half a mil deal with no diploma
Ice so blind it give your ass glaucoma
Its hard to live, but its easy to die
So I'm going through life lookin death in the eye
These rappers ain't gun slingers
They R&B singers
G-Unit, come thru with some guerilla niggas
Minimum wage ain't gonna pay the rent
Cause the seats in the coupe got the Fendi print
And this shit right here for the listeners pleasure
I'm still on the strip with the fifth and my ever
Its T-O-N-Y
Stay with a semi
Milk your crack spot - till the shit be bone dry
You think you pump hard? Nigga I pump harder
My phone ring so much, I walk around with the charger
When the D's come around, I'mma swallow my crack
Shit the work out later, and hit 'em with that
If it's a direct sale
I'mma change the bill
Tryin to push the new Range cause they changed the grille
Look nigga we icey thugs
We stay with them things so we stay with some Nike gloves

[HOOK]

[Tony Yayo]
Just havin fun with this rap shit, man
It never stops
My man 50 done put out, what, three albums on the street?
And y'all ain't even hear the new shit

Motherfuckin' Duracell Battery
It never stops
Word up
G-Unit
Sha Money XL



[Intro]
Shh... quiet... you hear that?
What the fuck, son?
I'm telling you, man, you gotta watch these niggas

[Hook]
I'm paranoid - bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat

[Verse 1]
We thought the coke and the dope would help us escape poverty
When that didn't work we resorted to armed robbery
Yeah, I done it, but I ain't the one they said did it
Before my first verse my Benz had been kitted
I'm so hood, that's what the bitches like about me
She bob and weave, she up and down, she suck the life up out me
I tell you 'bout my regimen, I blow a stack stunting
The coldest shit I'm on it, kid, I'll blow a nigga fronting
I'm dirty, yeah, I do that dirt ,I'm down to put that work in
I kick the door to get them bricks, that eagle get to chirpin'
You see that beam on ya head - nigga leaking
Yeah, screaming and shit - man, shut the fuck up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I had a dream niggas got me
Woke up, a nigga shot me
I ain't slept in three days
My eyes red, something wrong with my head
The Mac stashed right under the pillow on my bed
It's not hot, why the fuck am I sweatin'?
My heart beating, I'm bugging, I wreck it
Bitch, don't move, it's dark, I might panic
Just sit still, I mean it, God damn it
My back against the wall
Fuck the world, I'll kill 'em all
Ain't a nigga too big or too small
Chop 'em down, watch 'em fall
Watch 'em bleed, watch 'em crawl
Watch 'em bleed till they gone

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm paranoid - I can't even fucking sleep
I'm paranoid - bitch, quit playing, hand me my heat
I'm paranoid - I can't even rest my head
I'm paranoid - I'm finna leave me a nigga dead

[Outro]
What? Niggas ain't fucking with me
I wish a nigga would
I've been taking it easy on these niggas, mane
I've been easy on 'em ,mane
I'mma turn it up now, yeah



[Verse]
I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
36 mil in 8 months, you still think I'm bullshitting?
Catch me on top of Fortune's Hot 100
Head of G-Unit Enterprises, still getting blunted
Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break 'em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up
My body language saying ''fuck around and get clapped up''
I sip on Coke when it's with Henny, go for broke with the semi
Niggas talk behind my back, but they don't really want it with me
Pussy niggas pop shit, me I'm on that block shit
That rubber band, hundred grand in that night box, bitch
You know the raps bought the Benz, and the crack's bought the rims
Vivica she bought the gym, told ya I'm a fuckin' pimp
I was born a bad seed, I defied the odds
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I switched the cards
Still I keep a poker face, frontin' I'mma catch a case
Flip out, poke your face, you're laid out, now what a waste
I'm Super Fly Ron O'Neal of this rap shit
When that drama pop and you get shot
Let's see you bounce back, bitch

[Hook]
You nigga, you come around this bitch frontin'
I'mma have to chase you outta here



[Hook: 50 Cent 2x]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
When I grip the Tec
Kiss the deck
I'll spray at you're way
Nicknamed my chopper Scrappy thats my Kay Kay Kay Kay
Pussy get out of line and your ass can die today
Look at my soldiers to get 'em is all I got to say
Hennessy, rum and Coke a little Alize
Got me in the mood to bust a nigga head man
I ain't playin' ain't got no time for them games
Niggas lose they life all the time for fuckin' playin'

[Hook: 50 Cent 2x]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Look at my chick, look at my whip look how my rims move
Get a real good look, but don't scheme cause I got my pistol
Ain't none of y'all this smooth, Platinum on wrist blue
Wrist poppin' bling green by the fist full
I'm smokin' on good
Don't ride through the wrong hood
Unless you got a vest on
That Teflon
Like a don should
I'm rollin' sticky green
Every nigga with me clean
Strapped the fuck up know what I mean?

[Hook: 50 Cent 2x]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
It's the general homie thats commanding these invasions
My semi-automatic ravin'
Stay blazin'
The Rover be Etchel White
Shorty leaned over but I'm mad cause she got an over-bite
I got your baby's mother
Movin' motherloads of Coke
For Louis Vuitton minks, belts, bags and coats
Homie we enrich you're bitch a rug rat
Thats why my waves spinnin' in that G-Unit hat

[Hook: 50 Cent 2x]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, 50
I make it feel brand new
Guess what they tell me?
You make me feel brand new
Fuck with me, yeah

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
It go one for the money, two for the dough
Three for the pimping now early with the hoes
Four for my niggas running around with .44's
Repping that five all the way live
I got a style that reign supreme, Bentley made to lean
Pull up say ''what up?'', make a major scene
Stunt, flash the cream, nine laser beam
It's hard to miss your team, just follow that dot then pop

[Hook: Horace Brown]
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get the honey's, here we go

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm a South Side nigga, you can come through and ask for me
Systems thumping, pumping, 2Pac blast for me
Cali show me love, but me I'm from the East
I'm guessing I'm bi-costal when I'm on Dre beats
I get paper, stack paper, blow paper
Make paper, take paper, I'm major
I cake up, new Jacob, nigga, wake up
You're old straight up, pay up or get sprayed up

[Verse 3: Horace Brown]
M-O-N-E-Y, it's all good with me
Cause finally I can afford the life of luxury
And I remember in the day mamma had to work so hard
Just to pay the rent, all the money spent, had to get another job
And now we're living in an eight room mansion on the hill
And we sipping on, sipping on champagne when we chill
And we riding the Lex, Coupe, Beamers and the Benz
All over the world from the East to the West coast making ends
See, we do it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Horace Brown]
The show is what we live for cause we love to sing
We gonna freak you up and down, it's how we do our thing
And to the ladies in the house tonight
Looking fly, you got it right
It's gonna be an afterparty
And I've got to have somebody
And take 'em to my eight room mansion on the hill
We'll be sipping on Champagne when we chill
And we're riding in the Lex, Coupe, Beamer and the Benz
All the players from the East to the West Coast, we're making ends
This is why we do it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Horace Brown]
Why we sing? Why we sing?
It's the joy it brings, joy it brings
You know that you like our style, the reason why, yeah
The reason why we do what we do
See we got a love for the music
Simple as one two, three, sing it

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Man, you gonna be able to play this tape
Until I hear this shit coming outta every car, ma



[Hook]
If I can't eat man if I can't shine
Its just a matter of time
Before I back out runnin round wit my nine (its fucked up)
Cuz I GOTTA GET MINE

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You know how drought feel, fiends around niggas ain't got work
Stains from my roaches, grape drink on my t-shirt
Blowin' whites back and forth, beef boy was on the block
Niggas watchin' bootleg flicks in the barber shop
Tony he was up in it, talkin 'bout dis and dat
Sayin niggas owe him money they gon' pay him or get clapped
Man when it come to the bread niggas know what im about
Nigga owe me 7 grams I'm tryna air his ass out
Call the connect four times this nigga ain't callin' back
All of sudden hes pumpin' now dat niggas ain't got crack
Banks in the projects fuckin wit' bitches that fuck bitches
Tryna get by her to give her sumtin' in her momma kitchen
This rap shit just came to me son its like I be havin visions
After being shot the fuck up I make better descisions
I sat-back taught my soldiers how to re-act
El took my trey pound and blew blacks heart out his back
The beef don't mean nuttin' to me son I'm always in drama
Shit I say in my rap is real I put that on my momma
Say a prey before I sleep, lord bless me wit sum cake
And if I die before I wake I pray the lord my soul he take

[Hook]
If I can't eat man if I can't shine
Its just a matter of time
Before I back out runnin round wit my nine (its fucked up)
Cuz I GOTTA GET MINE



[Hook]
If you think you can fuck with 50
You got to be cra-zeeeee
I won't do a joint wit'chu, no matter how much
Your label try an' pay meeeee
I'm on top of hip-hop, I run with Aftermath
And motherfuckin Shadyyyyy
It's simple, I see you'd like to be me
Y'all niggas, can't fade meeeee

[50 Cent]
I could be a gentleman or gangster, the bitch done chose
Got semi-autos to put holes in, nigga's and hoes
My wrist all froze, for flicks I pose
Fiends sample my D's and those, I suppose that's about a 9
So far the grands stack for niggas sniffin white lines
Sell anything under the sun to get mines, I'm gon' shine
Stunt for the summer, H2 Hummer, got paper now I'm picky
Change the rims, drape the watch, trade the Timbs, I upgrade
Now I'm paid - catch me in the Trump Tower lobby
Strokin' other niggas hoes is my hobby
Treat me like Kemosabe baby, suck me baby
I roll with Shady and Dr. Dre, ohhhh~!
I'm down to, try my luck, see if I can fingerfuck in the truck
G-5, 50 so live
Soon as my zipper go down her eyes wide
Got her in the telly on the bed with her hands tied, wooo!

[Hook]
If you think you can fuck with 50
You got to be cra-zeeeee
I won't do a joint wit'chu, no matter how much
Your label try an' pay meeeee
I'm on top of hip-hop, I run with Aftermath

"Is this what you want?"
G-Unit, God's Plan!!



[Intro: 50 Cent]
What you saying boy, boy?
Ha ha - said what you saying boy?

[Hook: 50 Cent]
See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever run
Niggas say the wrong shit to me like he wanna do me
Somebody be at him with my gun
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world

[Verse 1]
Listen, nigga you play me and I'mma go crazy
You push me I'mma motherfucking trip
I come tripping through your set busting off my TEC
I gives a fuck if you's a Blood or a Crip
Nigga from J.F.K. to L.A.X., I'm back through the sets again
Gangsta life, that's right, crazy-ass Mexicans
Do it the raw way, broad day, AK
Spray cause a melee, mayday mayday
Freak bitch suck me on tape like Ray J
Niggas that I'm up against know they can't fade me
I'm the last one, you know the last don
She know she wanna come, bitch, bring your ass on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See, I come from the Southside where niggas is outside
Right now with the rubber grips
Niggas say they gon' see me to hit 'em on G.P
Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
When you come from where I'm from you come from the bottom
They ain't supposed to get this rich
So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat
Now I'm thinking "man, ain't this a bitch?"
Niggas stick cola in cola, from moving the yola
Next thing you know they up in your crib
Saying ''where's the stash at?'' You move they gon' blast that
So I suggest you stand still, kid

[Hook]

[Outro]
This a man's world
Watch your mouth girl, this a man's world

Keep ya mouth shut, and keep ya ears open

[Hook] x2
Everywhere I'm at everywhere I go, I stay surrounded by hoes
Even when I'm tryin to be on the low, I'm recognized by hoes
Man, its gotta be cause of the dough, its got to be cause of the dough
Cause the game sure wasn't like this before, it wasn't like this before

[Verse 1]
50 Cent I'm makin hits now
Don't try an act like you ain't heard I'm the shit now
Some bitches changed, cause they know I'm fittin to blow
You should see how they react when I come through the door
In the club my niggas, we fittin to ball out
Drink till we fall out
Some shit jump off, nigga we goin all out
Shots big enough to tear the fuckin wall out
I'll have your punk ass on the dance floor tryin to crawl out
I had bad luck, then my luck changed up
You see the Range, you see the rims all blinged up
You ain't hear what I charge for 16, I'm makin a killin
These other rap niggas just catching feelings

[Hook] x2
Everywhere I'm at everywhere I go, I stay surrounded by hoes
Even when I'm tryin to be on the low, I'm recognized by hoes
Man, its gotta be cause of the dough, its got to be cause of the dough
Cause the game sure wasn't like this before, it wasn't like this before

Haha, yeah
Yeah that's it nigga, what the fuck you thought
I ain't giving niggas more than 16 for a motherfuckin freestyle
The fuck you want for free man
Ya'll niggas be wanting a lot for free man
Fuck them other niggas, other niggas can't rap
That's why they give you 100 motherfuckin bars for nothing man
You know what I mean
Fuck that shit man, I ain't gonna sit there rappin to you all night
Haha, the fuck man
Hey yo, Sha Money XL, nigga teamwork
We work hard nigga
50 Cent



[50 Cent]
Hold up
Son them niggas know who hit that nigga son (I know, I know)
They - how the fuck, we gon' know who hit him, and they don't know who hit him?
The hood talkin man, e'rybody know~! (I know, it's fucked up)

[Intro]
Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggas try and lay me down wit heat
And if I should die though before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

[50 Cent]
If dead men could talk in your sleep your homey told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him? (Huh?)
Or would you start switchin upv
You thinkin 'bout the penitentiary and bitchin up?
What if he said money ain't everything, the hood raised us wrong
All jux'll get your money long but look here I'm gone
Would that touch your heart? Have you feelin funny inside?
Would that be enough to make your punk-ass ride?
What if he gave you a little list of things to do?
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load the gats, and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at yo' crib and hide?
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength, now you in a daze
Your homey turnin over in his grave... cause you PUSSY!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up" - B.I.G. {*repeat 3X*}
"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up with the lugers from they Rugers or they Desert"
(RIGHT~!!)

[50 Cent]
Them boys smoked your homey, ye ain't gon' do nuttin back?
Not even if he told you you next to get clapped?
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples gon' probably cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga is you down for this 1-8-7?
When you reach the pearly gates, how you gon' explain
You gon' try and tell God you've been framed?
Y'all did everything together, he was your dog
Now you Uptown coppin, and he in the morgue
Them niggas he gave packs to, they kept the cake
His sister and his baby momma talkin to Jake (uh-huh)
Niggas that rocked him, they came to the wake
But they ain't come inside, they sat out in the ride
At the funeral, homicide all in the buisness
Walkin 'round askin niggas to tell 'em who did it
Niggas is throwin blows now you ready to rumble?
Thirsty niggas are animals, the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga'll body somethin over a bundle
Man a three-year-old kid in my hood know what a gun do

[Hook] - repeat 'til 15 seconds left

[Outro]
Sha Money, XL!
Shadyville, teamwork, music



[Verse 1]
Now if I pull out the gat and just push your wig back
I bet niggas will stand around sayin' "Damn who did that?"
I'm the type nigga to dare you to touch the jack
I'm the type to borrow your gat then won't give the shit back
Im F to the I - F -T - Y - C - E - N - T
Caress the ass gently in back of Bentleys
You thought she was pimpin, son I was in the Hamptons
In a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch flappin
I'm planning to take over New York then start expanding
Was Bob Marley singing about teks when he sung "I'm Jammin'?
Nigga fuck with my cash and I'll blast yo' ass
Snatch the Glock out the stash in the dash in mash
Flee in a flash, lay low let time go past
If you survive the shots I'ma find yo' ass
Put the gat to your head and remind your ass
I ain't playin' with you, I want my money motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Yo, some nigga just shot the block up dog, word?
He had the same shit you got on dog, word?
I know you done did it so get the fuck up outta hear, ya heard?
I run with niggas that'll spray and strip and stay there shit
You won't let us pump on your block, fuck it, we makin it hot
I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch
From the cordless cell phone in baby blue drop
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street
These industry niggas are startin' to look like something to eat
They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand
My niggas living on section eight in public housing
They'll murder you and keep the shit low cause niggas heard of you
Them b-more niggas is rowdy rowdy
Them Detroit niggas is bout it bout
If they say they gonna kill ya nigga don't you doubt it
Got your gun well don't leave home without it


[Verse 3]
Yo, your man could have ran when I robbed him but he froze
Son I ain't even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed
The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she chose
Now you heart broke, that's what you get for lovin' them hoes
An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid
Runnin round without no heat, it's like a fifth with no kick
A fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit
A bad bitch that won't blow dick
It's like a rollie with no ice, a gamblin' spot with no dice
Like fuckin' supermodel bitches and not bustin' off twice
I murder any mic device, for the right price, I'm nice
I only say things once, never twice, don't fuck with me

[Intro]
Yeah
Feels good

[Verse 1]
I might be the crookest nigga movin' around with 3 felonies
I get a laugh at all the bullshit niggas be tellin' me
My hood full of niggas like Marky and Bill Bellamy
Them funny niggas will get ya, so keep the heat with ya
It's Ferrari
Nigga, my name hold weight, like a diesel nigga on a bitch pressed up state
Here's my number, 94R6378
In case you thought the shit I say in my line's fake
I make a mess in the mess hall - cause a brawl
Caught you catchin' no charge; oh God
Why's my life so hard?
Cause I ain't book-smart, they think I'm a retard
No, I dont know much about the French I talk
All I know is when that drama pop off, these pussies is shook
This is Rikers Island pain talk; your phone time’s my chalk
My time is my time, and your time's mine, punk
Cut you from ear to ear, [?]

[Chorus]
I'm a rider
Wherever I'm in or out, I'm me
Whether I'm locked or I'm free
Whatever I'm at, I'm who I be
You know you wanna be a rider like me
I'm a rider
Wherever I'm in or out, I'm me
Whether I'm locked or I'm free
Whatever I'm at, I'm who I be
You know you wanna be a rider like me

[Verse 2]
Any nigga with a glass jaw gotta get his shit cracked
Soon as I touch the bricks, I bust a clip and take the strip back
Give me [?] money for a week; I could flip that
They had my face while I'm juxin' you when I push your shit back
[?] used to carry billy clubs, Trey-eight slugs
Now they carry nines but I got hollows in mine
I see my homies on the corner, burnin' a dutch
Take a [?]; next thing you know, I'm [?] fucked up
Every Tuesday I'm in parole, listenin' to niggas
Lyin' through they teeth 'bout how they holdin' fingers
You make police contact? (Nope)
Stayin' out of trouble? (Nope)
Got a job yet? (Nope)
I'm still sellin' dope
I'm just playin' [?]
Let me piss in a cup
And I got shit I gotta do; you really fuckin' me up
See you, I could talk to you; you know what's up
All that drug program shit be slowin' me up

[Chorus]
I'm a rider
Wherever I'm in or out, I'm me
Whether I'm locked or I'm free
Whatever I'm at, I'm who I be
You know you wanna be a rider like me
I'm a rider
Wherever I'm in or out, I'm me
Whether I'm locked or I'm free
Whatever I'm at, I'm who I be
You know you wanna be a rider like me

[Spoken Outro]



[INTRO]
Yeah
This is gonna hurt you this time
Gon’ see if y’all niggas can survive to second round
You said what?!
It’s over boy!
It’s like a Murder Inc clearance sale…

[Chorus]
Ask about me
They’ll tell you I’m an animal, an animal
You touch one of mines I’ll react like an animal, an animal
They say I have no conscience
I’ll kill if I have to, y’all
They say I’m an animal
Sometimes a nigga cross the line and he got to go
Move on him like an animal

Nigga don't talk to me if you ain't in my bracket
100 mil, that's 60 after taxes
I was a little dirty nigga flipping my mattress
Sneakers fuck up til I started pumping packs, kid
Beefin' with the older niggas getting my ass kicked
Bought a little .380 I stopped all that shit
Back on that bullshit you know I’ve been on
Riding with the same 9 Tre used to kill Bon
Niggas dead serious, niggas though we was playin
Picture me laughing in the crib after Tre shot Wayne
Southside ain't southside without the team
Niggas starving I feed em they'll ride for me
When feds come, nigga shit gets funky
Irv love Preme he fittin' to be his bunkee
In a park full of kids, I pop of the mack
They see the flare from the nozzle and scatter like rats
I know the police is listening, this is for the D's
Me and Star was cool & I ain't hit Cheese
Signed a deal and made a mil before Bags got shot
Made 20 more 'fore Tah-Tah got knocked
Man this rap shit is me B, I got this locked
Treat it just like the block workout non-stop
I dazzle with the footwork, maneuver with the heat
Think boy or get your brains left in the street
Yeah the Stick-up Kids say it’s out the tax
But I get your shines back for you homie, relax
I send my little shooters right at 'em with Gats
Hit 'em so hard they gonna send that back
You know I know who ran up in your crib
The first thing they do is holla at the kid
They say 50 fucked with us man, we poor need work
They need niggas like us to do their dirt

[Chorus]
Ask about me
They’ll tell you I’m an animal, an animal
You touch one of mines I’ll react like an animal, an animal
They say I have no conscience I’ll kill if I have to, y’all

Move on him like an animal

Yo don't want stitches in yo grill motherfucker, then chill
As a young buck, niggas always knew I puff
Yousta see me go to school, on a smoiler bus (woo)
I'm a sped ed kid, I'm gettin' all this paper (uh huh)
You should sit, scibble lines and see where it take ya
Had violent tendencies, so they thought I was dumb
Why the so called smart kids was poppin' guns
I think about poppin' a gun, and then get the lump sum
Grampa my role model, yousta suck on a bottle
A pint a Crown Royal, make your insides boil
Been smell like Ben Gay, cause his back go out
He the one that taught me, what bein' black's about
Now peep the roach on the walls, that fall and crawl on my friend's
Wrist, Sittin' up in them Benz, to be in the pen
In the hood we hit the number, but never the lotto
Life in the fast lane, one wheel hit the pothole
Let's go, let's flow nigga

[Hook - Singing] - 2X
War, what is it good for absolutely nothin'
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier

Fake gangsta nigga, you want to seem nigga (yeah)
You don't seem nigga, yeah nigga

Uh huh, ya heard

[Hook]
She boomerang, I do my thang, she come back
Everytime that bitch say she leaving she come back
She boomerang-rang, she boomerang-rang
She boomerang-rang, she boomerang-rang

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
This one’s for all you niggas on lock down
Really missing the bitch with the dick in her mouth
Now she say "she leaving", I say "leave"
Shit I need air to breath
She no neccessity to me, I got game like the NBA
Pro bitch, I know shit
My nickname NFL, a Nigga Fucking Loaded
I’m rich like them white boys out there playing hockey
NHL, a Nigga Hold a Llama and I’m cocky
Should I explain myself, baby I’m on that hood shit
So say you wanna go, well I say go ‘head good bitch
I tour PGA, that's "Pussy n Good Ass"
Bitch, when your on the jet, everybody first class
Shots of Tequila, Philippine cuisine, Adobo
You know a nigga loco
My photo on the cover of the Vibe
A nigga so live, it’s GQ, XXL and Black Enterprise

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
All I wanna do is flip money and make a profit
Shorty get to working my nerves, she need to stop it
Special investigate son, she jumping through my phone
I wanna fucking be friend this is not want I want
Shit was cool til she shifted now her emotions involved
I got that dick game that put bitches in pyscho ward
She said she need me like she need air
And it hurts because I’m acting like I don’t care
I was stuck so we fuck, call it "make up sex"
Call it magic, she tried to leave, she come back
She gotta have it
She addicted to my left stroke
Nah man, my right stroke
I hit the back of that thing, she hit high notes

[Hook]

[Outro - 50 Cent]
You niggas in trouble man
I woke up this morning, feeling like the old me
I swear to God man
Everytime I say something, it’s hot
This shit just come outta me man
They say I work just what I am
I’m an artist, Dont waste your time being a critic
Because I’m critically acclaimed muthaf-cker
Around the World, I’m 1 of 1
There will never be another me
I’m a perfectionist striving for perfection
50 Cent, fuck with me, G-g-g-g-g-unit



[Verse 1]
Some friends turn foes over money and hoes
When they family ain't tight, when they money ain't right
When you party with me, you party all night
Cause I ain't with doing nothing if we ain't doing it right
Players hate us when they getting face-to-face altercations
They be getting played like Sony Playstation
When the feds having fun, cockblockers try to stop me
I heard some cats be in the background trying to clap me
I see them when they start scheming, I know what they thinking of
Mad at us for being players and they can't get no love
What it boil down to, cause my flow's hot, your flow's not
You're so-so going against 50 Cent, that's a no-no
Y'all know better than that

[Hook]
Flowers blooming, morning dew, and the cats just ain't the same
It's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true in the game
Easy living while we're pimping what we know we're dreaming of
We are one having fun walking in the glow of a thug

[Verse 2]
First it was me and my pistol, but since the last mistrial
Spin up a Cristal, I'm living it up
My lawyer, K.O.'d the case, checked the lawbook for my name
I sit in courtrooms and throw signs like I'm a Mason
Money is power, envy is cash, breed evil
I could be robbed with the jewels I drop
Came into the store a year ago
I decided to stack chips on the whip
Push the hoot, now I be sitting on Beach Huevo
Contemplating coping the Coupe... Hmm, should﻿ I?
Ghetto as I wanna be, I say "What up dude?"
When I breach you serve you bricks, through time to beat you
Send you back if you headed to your people
Threw out my chest when I make power moves like I'm right on the L

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You wanna, party with me, come on, party with me
Oh, you don't wanna party with me, it's aight with me
Shorty, what's your favorite champagne, Cristal, Moet or Dom P?
Lighten up, get a bottle boo, but it ain't on me
I'm caught up, in my ghetto way of thinking
From the ice, to the minks, to the champagne we drinking
Big boys is playing Benzos with AMG kits and 20 inch Lorenzos
Follow me, round and round, the club
3 and a quarter drop-tops with hard tops
20 whips for chip; that's it. Average joes who flip bricks
My team flash keys like they grow on trees
When it's hot, park the whips and ride bikes
If you [?] through traffic on the turn-bikes, aight



[Intro]
New York City (New York City), you are now rackin' with 50 Cent (with 50 Cent)
Are you ready? (are you ready?) (*gun cocks*) I said are you ready? (are you ready?)
See you with me nigga? (with me nigga) Drop that! (drop that)
Paid for a hooptie but I wanted a drop

[Verse 1]
G-UNIT! Somethin' new, somethin' new
I'm not that nigga, in your video
I'm not a trick, I don't love the hoes
And niggas know I be, on the low
But I miss my dough, and I twist my dro
I'm not that nigga, that you think you know
I walk around with a big four four
You front on me, I'm gonna get at you dog
I be right at your crib, waitin' at your door
(What up bitches)

[Verse 2]
Comin' up I ain't had much, I wanted a lot
I had paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop
So you know, I had to make somethin' out of nothin' (Yeah)
Like turn an empty spot, into a crack spot pumpin' (woo)
Also hard at 19, I bought a Benz I did
The older niggas really wasn't feelin' the kid
Tried to find out where I lived, so they could run in my crib
But you can't hustle a hustler, I peeped in a sled
Back then niggas yousta call me boo
In 6 months, I sold a million gold tops on got brew
Country came around, ease it and clappin' then
Country left, strange shit started happenin'
Like C shot Ra for some ends, Ra shot Dro for some chins
Cory shot Drew, and we was friends
Money turns boys into men
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again

[Verse 3]
Nah nigga, ain't nothin' change nigga
Yeah I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back
Damn 50 good to see you back in the hood
You see my cherry red SL, nigga I'm doin' good
Sometime I can't find the words to say how I feel
So I take a quote from Menace, "look at the wheels"
I'm addicted to stuntin', now that I'm holdin' somethin'
I got a trunk full of guns, from VA today
(oh yeah, let me hold somethin')
Nigga you high or somethin'
I don't play games, I'm about my money, nigga buy somethin'
I got a few fifths, I got a few nines
Here nigga, take one, catch it took, and bring me mine

[Outro - 50 Cent talking]
Yeah, don't ever say I don't do nothin' for you nigga
You know, uh, don't say I don't look out for ya
Ya know what I mean, but make sure you nigga, you go catch some jokes
And you come back, nigga have 'em, and have my paper for that thang thang
You know what I'm sayin'? Say I don't want it back, nigga don't try to use it
And don't get it back for me, nigga and no shit like that
In fact, I can see ya'll niggas now
Run around sayin', 50 gettin' all this rap money, and he won't help us (haha)
Sit tight nigga I'm comin'
You know, new shit, all this shit I put out on the mixtapes
Is for the mixtapes, I got a million, OH MY GOD!
My shit is so hot right now, I'm in a zone



[Lloyd Banks]
Marsh' knows man
Talk tough, 'til you get cuffed and start tellin, damn~!
Everyday I shot a new bitch
And when I'm done with her it'll look like...

[50 Cent]
At first they didn't want me, now they want me
See a nigga gettin paid they wanna push up on me
You should see these hoes chasin a nigga
I have 'em in the hotel tastin a nigga
50 like a lollipop, lick me baby
Then lick Dr. Dre and Shady, OH~!



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yo, niggas be asking me "Yo 50 who you got beef with?"
Ima tell y'all niggas who I got beef with
I got beef wit any nigga I can't make no money wit
If I can't make no money wit you, fuck you nigga
G-Unit nigga, that's what's up cause I said that's what's up

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I get money, money I got
So its a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster cause I use my little soldier
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed to
Heavy pistol sales for living
My gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
While  I'm out for the ends, you out for a rep
That's the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches
So I'm gon sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!
But deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!
Cause we got them three b's: benzes, burners, and bitches
And plus we on the road to the riches

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Lately, I been going through a phase
Hope they ain't tap the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore I'm on the move with the squad
I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I'd rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You don't really wanna fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty
Tryin to be cool
Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un-Huh)
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from watching Brucie B
Look, I shot the sheriff
And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot
Here's the plan, I'm a keep stackin' my ends
Till I'm on airplane seats in the Maybach benz
I'm all about the chips
I done took them trips
22's on the 6
26 on the bricks
And them outta town niggas, I'm chargin' yall more
I tapdance on the shit I ain't servin' it raw
You sell smoke, look, nigga, I got what you need
But it ain't goin' cheap I got mouths to feed
Niggas always sayin' damn 50 you bugged
Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug
Gimme his watch and his chain
We not the same, he a lame
He want pussy I'm bout my money man
Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick
Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed
Yo it's 50, when your mindframe change and start to rearrange
I'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50
Shots 'til your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out



[Intro]

[Verse 1: Scarlett]
Picture me rolling Range Rover
Same color your Air Force Ones
White on white, ya like?
Red I Flight the night
From L.A. to N.Y
I'm Harlem bound
You see how bitches tense up, when Scarlett 'round
Niggas get the heart to holla while we up in the club
But get intimidated when they see me sitting on dubs
I hear 'em whispering " dat ain't a man, shit that's her."
She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up
Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up
Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up
I got a fetish for the chips
20's for the six
Hollows for the clips
Try me, if you think I'm playing bitch
And the police we'll have another crime scene taker
Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody ain't shook, you see doing the shake

[Hook: 50 Cent]
The boss spending ends
Saying, "Gimme that Benz, 20 inch rims, and four TV's"
The snitch in the precinct saying
"He sell X, he sell techs, and he sell D"
The balla by the bar saying
"Everybody drink, the best champagne, it's all on me"
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying, "He robbed me"
It's elementary

[Verse 2:Lloyd Banks]
Now get the fuck on the floor
I slid through the front door
With the 9 and the velour
A cal in my pocket
You wil', I'mma pop it
I'm down for a profit
I'm ghetto as hell
You can't you tell?
My road dog, under the jail
Getting frustrating mail
So I'm drinking and smoking
Thinking and hoping
This cell gon' open
You can dance next to me, but don't throw an elbow
I'll throw one back and leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no
I ain't paying for pleasure
Your pussy don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure
It's every girl's dream, to floss with the team
Long on the suine
DVD's on the screen
Blowing on cream
Waiting for you to scheme
You ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I don't wanna grow up, I'mma hustler kid
Go'head and stunt, see I don't pop two your wig
I'm artistic, intelligent, so much ability
When I use them big words, your bitch be feeling me
So ya'll niggas hate me, cause your wives be our groupies
Ya'll irritate me, like loud people in the movies
Fall back, matter fact back down
Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits
Sex sells, so I'mma P-I-M-P
So my pockets never be empty
It ain't no problem, we scoop them models
We got condoms, coups, and lavish condos
50 got me getting ass like I never did
So when I step in the club, hoes love the kid

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
The cat in the house go
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
The bird in the cage go
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
It's elementary

[Intro]
Ay, ay quit billing my phone, bruv
You think money grows on trees?

[Bridge]
I just got back from the U.K
But I'm going back to the U.K
I just bought a flat in the U.K
(You just got back baby today?)
I just got back from the U.K
But I'm going back to the U.K
I'm a little jetlag now, okay?
(Look, the dick's rock hard baby for me)

[Hook]
She's my London girl - she's my, my
My London girl - she's my, my

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the first time I seen her, son, I knew she was the shit
I seen her in the V.I.P. chilling with her clique
She hot, mane, I watched her, I like her style
She don't know what I'm thinking when I'm staring at her lips
In my imagination I can see her suck the dick
I like that, I want that, we could do it right now
Just a minute of your time, let me talk to ya love
I wan' get to know you, maybe I can call you up
Then we can chit-chat 'til you let me hit that
I'll get deep 'til I hit the back of your kit-kat
You're not a freak, but you'll be one when I'm done
It's anytime, anyplace with me, hon
I'm sexual, when I'm next to you
I'm a horny dog, oh my God

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She said she's so sophisticated, you know when she talk to me
She's such an intellectual, she make me want her sexual
Give what I got, backshot after backshot, sweat non-stop
I really like the way she move, I'm trying to say she hot
She rodeo, she ride it good when she get on top
She work it, she work it and she be putting it down
It looks good, yeah, good enough to taste it
A boy toy, yeah. I'm what she wan' play with
She a cougar, got a little age on me
But I'm experienced, that's what she don't know, homie
The same old, same old, starting to feel different
Anytime, any place, baby, I'm with it
Don't stop get it, get it
Collapse, relax then get right back with it

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah that's the shit
Yeah that's my bitch
I just got back from the U.K
I got a new bitch in the U.K
My paper's straight, I'm okay
I just got back, nigga, today

[Outro]
50, you fucking with the #1 nigga now
You know, I'm international, Jack
You understand what I'm saying, nigga?
Anywhere around the globe
International gangsta shit
You heard me? I'm a pop sensation
When I cock that and pop that you gon' understand what I'm saying



[Produced by Nascent & QB Da Problem]

[Intro]
{"Doesn't really matter - us"}
No, it don't fucking matter
{"Doesn't really matter - us"}
We gon' do it my way
{"Doesn't really matter - us"}
From here on out it's my way

[Hook]

Hammer cocked when I'm coastin', yeah

Hammer cocked when I'm coastin'
Redrum, redrum
Fuck with me it'll be murder one
Redrum, redrum
One shooter, ten shots, one gun
This is redrum
{"Oh, it's too late, oh, it's too late"}

[Verse 1]
If I hit him I'll hurt him, I just catch him and murk him
I'm not sitting here waiting for him to come back, nah
Soon as I spot him I got him, I'mma run up and drop him
Get that P-90 popping, nigga hold that, uh
I get the gun and they running, niggas know me for dumbing
I got a good reputation, what the fuck can I say?
Some of these niggas is bitches, yeah, most of 'em snitches
So I don't let 'em know it's me doing dirt when it's me
I know just how to work it, I can make it go perfect
Have the homicides sitting there scratching their head
To me a victim's a victim, you could pay me and pick 'em
Then I hunt ‘em down and take his head off like a deer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I bet you think that I'm vicious, catch you hugging and kissing
While the love's in the air I put a hole in your heart
Plus so now that I'm missing, I'm a fucking magician
You might find my DNA all over your broad
Me and my cannibal methods, I eat you niggas for breakfast
See the cannon respect it, nigga, take off the chain (now)
Robberies turn to murder, I do shit you ain't heard of
Change my mind and just pop you in a blink of an eye
I know you thought I was bluffing, but to me this is nothing
Now you can lay there leaking, go 'head curl up and die
You tell God when you see him I'll be happy to meet him
I went to service this evening, he forgives, not I

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's murder
Nothing but murder



{*set to the beat of "G'd Up" by Tha Eastsidaz*}

Yeah, I stay with my ratchet nigga

You best be on your best behavior out this motherfucker!

[Hook: 50 - singing]
I stay gangsta'd up, niggas ain't got shit on me

Geeee-Unit clique, you're blind if you can't see
That weeeee run the streets, nigga you better ask somebody

[Tony Yayo]
I got a rifle with a scope in the trunk of the Viper
So I shoot off the roof like the D.C. sniper
I just bought a bezel, and a brand new piece
And a level two vest and a brand new piece
See y'all hip-hop niggas don't want no beef
Y'all get shot and rat to the hip-hop police
Nigga two guns up, I run up in your label
Why your guns in the house like a couch potato?

[Hook]

[Lloyd Banks]
These hoes want me to stop, but this is the worst part
I was born with this game like birthmarks
I don't trip, but I'mma get a little watch from my modelin chick
Cause she spent a lot of time on my dick
I get a new fan every single time that I spit
Gray and blue Benz, lovin' every diamond I get
Fast and furious in the Rang Rove', cause my bread folds
Beef I hit your neck and turn your jewelry into red gold

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
I'm from the bottom man niggas know I came up hard
I got a temper man I'm looking for some shit to start
Man my tax bracket change, I'm sittin on some change
The hoes man they changed they don't treat me the same
It's not my looks that's got me all up in them drawers
It's the new M3 with the Lamborghini doors
Man them D's they done turned them dogs into dopefiends
Smell a leak in my clothes so they barkin at me - WHOA!!

Yeah, that's gon' have to be good enough
I lost a friend tonight
Jam Master Jay... rest in peace
I send my love to his family
50 Cent y'all

Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let ya fears let you confuse sayin' "fifty's bad news"
I need you in my life girl, your too much to lose

[Beat switches]

Give Tony too much dope, I'm pushin' the big boy
V12, SL detailed
I rap and wait for them checks in the mail
If you hatin', your due time life will expire
Cause my guns speak jamaican, they be like "Bloodfire!"
Where I'm from, niggas be on some sleek shit
They hungry, use they lighters to cook their beef stick
And this 'dro and this nestle got me right
So my lungs be as black as Wesley Snipes
I'm on first class flights heading towards Vegas
Ya slot machines niggas, we crap table players
I roll a seven, cause we crap table players

[Hook]

[Lloyd Banks]
I know a lot of niggas want Banks gone
My kind of beef will fuck up ya grill and not the kind you put franks on
I'm hidin' out, so my meals is home cooked
I deal wit more ho's than a chinese phone book
You're high with your messed up ratchets
I'm out blowin' haze bags the size of ketchup packets
Fuck who's in ya ride, there's tools on my side
By the females standin' with tattoos on they thighs
There's a lot of cats losin' they wives
Cause next time I see 'em, they got black and blues on they eyes
Nah, I ain't ready to die, but I'm prepared
But I'd rather grow old with grey hairs in my beard
They know me in the field, the kid with the fans
That argue over my balls like Kobe and Shaquille
If you talkin' bout millions throw me in the deal
Big city, stadium tour, Rollie in the wheel motherfucker

[Intro]
{"Alright, are you ready?"}
Fuck that

[Hook]
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze, hit him through the do'
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him on the front porch by his momma do'
These niggas is green

[Verse 1]
It's nothing to it, cock it, bang it and get rid of that
Hit his fitted cap, he won't get a chance to Twitter that
I make the Ruger sing a song, bullets hum to you
You better have God with you when I come to you
I'm a grimy nigga, I said some simple shit
You's a dirty nigga with syphilis on your dick
I catch you I'mma wash you up, line you, spit-shine you
Leave you right there in the street where niggas can find you
Die, nigga, die, fly, pelican, fly
When I pull it eat a bullet, don't question me why
That's the laws of the jungle, I'll show you what the gun do
My bad, what the shell do, you rot until they smell you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get green, son, get him, cut his head
He didn't even see it coming, he sleeping, that's what he did
Get biz, niggas acting like it ain't what it is
Let the knife work push the blade up in his shit
Let Doc come sew him up, gang signs throw 'em up
In my hood growing up you pussy or you 'bout it
You shooting or you running, the police coming
Niggas get at you you get at them or you don't mean nothing
Niggas walk tough, even walk like warriors
On some G shit, they get to singing like Gloria
Now come clean, tell us what you told the D's
Matter fact don't tell us shit, motherfucker, hold these

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Yeah, feels like summer to me
Expect it nice and hot
40 day, my bad, my bad
Family day, I be in the projects

Get a chance to do some new shit
You don't wanna miss this, trust me

[Hook]

And come through in a Lex with Claudette Ortiz
With no roof on the top, that's my Sunday car
In the Hummer lookin hot, that's my Monday car
I got a stable of hoes, now I'm a P-I-M-P
And bring in bitches on a Amtrak with grams of D
We got beams on the gat, we detail our weapons
And the way that I rap, we e-mail addressin
Niggas hear what I spent, and wonder how I write it

[Intro]
Nigga no wait, no pine box, no funeral
Just 9 shots, take Pac 5, plus Big 4
You got 50, I love war

[Hook 1x]:
Who wanna box, with my ox
You wanna thump, I wanna dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]:
I think I got him, 10 shots, follow the trail of the blood drops
Fuck the police, better talk to Allah arc
Nigga you bleeding bad, yeah, you bleeding bad
Your Rolex soaked, like the kotex
You know next, it's gonna get dark
Where the cops when you fucking need them?
That blood filling your lungs boy, I see you weezin'
The harder you tryna run, the more you leakin'
You could have found something better to do this weekend
I got an arsenal, poison tips in my archery
Battery acid, I burn your face off properly
Guns ammo, knife Rambo
Nightmare, wake up I'm right there
You're hellbound, hell yeah!

[Hook 2x]:
Who wanna box, with my ox
You wanna thump, I wanna dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk

[Verse 2 - Kidd Kidd]:
Rider.. Gang!

Haaaaa!

Talk that shit now, I love it when you frontin´
Eating all that pussy, guess cat got your tongue
Open up your mouth when say it to the pump
Buckshot come out the back of your neck like razor bumps
I'm too small to fight you can swing all you want
I box with the ox, you drop, I swing once (haaa!)
This a sad scene, at least you die happy
Next lick eater, it look like you was smiling at me
Damn Kidd Kidd, snuck me after he just dap me
Tell a nigga I'm grimy, bitch I'm from Mays am street (?)
If you holler gangsta shit, come get at me
I sprint like athletes in a track meet

[Hook 2x]:
Who wanna box, with my ox
You wanna thump, I wanna dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk



[Hook: 50 Cent]
When it's on you better get-get-get-get-get down
Get-get-get-get-get down
I pull out you better, get down
I let off you better, get down
Get-get-get-get-get down, get-get-get-get-get down
When its on you better, get dow
I pull out you better, get dow

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You know it takes 7 days and 6 nights before I get right
I get Puffy then I lean on him, put that beam on him
You proably heard Ma$e tried to join the team
Cause Puffy's too busy selling pimple cream
What Puff sell next is Maybelline
Or dance next to Joc to try to get hot
This is the quiet before the storm, the warning before it's on
50 back on that shit, 50 finger to flip

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo)]
They don't do it like this, concentrate on the wrists
I got see-through rocks on a Chronoswiss
I got rich real quick, now I'm sipping on Cris'
Its T-O-N-Y, G-Unit is the clique
On the back the clip, thats the hammer on the pound
So you better (get-get-get-get-get down)
I'm on the Greyhound and now I'm on the run
Cause I ain't doing time for no damn murder one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hot Rod]
When I roll through the hood, man, it's all good
These hoes get down when I show 'em my wood
Niggas get down cause they knowing they should
And when them thangs spit rounds they flow through the hood
If you's a hard nigga you feeling you gotta prove it
I run with the Unit, please man don't do it
Act tough now, you have to duck down
You hit the lotto last week, you out of luck now, nigga

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
I get money, money I got
The strawberry deck could be the same color the drop
You can see a nigga clear when I put down the top
Sunlight hit the watch, you see the shit down the block
Anything colored VS, my shit right
My shits is diamonds, yours boltonites
I know ya plan was to fake it till you make it
But I'mma blow ya ass up, lets face it

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
Now play my Tony Yayo shit

Yeah, 50 Cent

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Back seat of the Caddy truck or Tahoe
Back seat of the Benz truck or Expo
Back seat of X5 or Range Rov'
So when I pick you up, you know how this shit go - ho

[Tony Yayo]
Hey yo, my truck talk for me
If I was bummy and ugly
Your bitch'll still have love for me
As long as I push a truck, rims chunky
Never open my lips, your bitch wanna fuck me
Beep the air horn, hop in turn the heat on
Pick you up off the streets get your feet warm
She giving sex cause the Lex truck takes unleaded
Big thick thighs, eyes browner than Sahara deserts
Deuce-Deuce, bitches, yeah they caught your eye
And them loud system full of bass and highs
You see that X5 BM
Packed with Puerto Ricans
Bad mommies on the low, just creepin
Niggas be frontin like they bubbling coke
But they really struggling with a high car note, ha ... (YEAH)

[50 Cent]
Might see me in the Jeep
Rollin' 'round 4 deep
And you know we on the creep
Nigga, I'm holdin' it

[Hook]

[Tony Yayo]
Back seat of my truck lets swing an episode
Fuck a hotel we have sex on the road
I pull the seats back
Put the sheets in the luggage rack
Pull out my balls
And play an Aaron Hall track
I tell a chick "Bend over, mami"
Hit 'em with the Henny Dick
Now my windows foggy
Its time to party, I got TV's, CD's and DVD's
Now bitch, get on your knees
You could be a model chick or a silly hood rat
Don't cum on my leather, don't stain my floor mats
Where's your baby mama?
She in the truck and I'm blessin her
Undressing her
Make hop out for air re-freshener
I ain't stressing her
Cause my rims keep checkin her
She's 21, my rim size older than her
TWENTY TWO'S

[50 Cent]
Niggas say they want beef
But when they see me in the street
They don't slow down to speak
Cause they know I'm holdin ..

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
I’ll put this shit together, I’ll tear this shit apart
Demolition, the architect, I’ll let you see the spark
Bullet open your head make your brain a landmark
Put what you thinking on the curb nigga mark my word
If there’s a L to take it’s gon' be your loss
Double-barrel buck spray, your ass get tore off
You’ve been warned, you hard nigga I’m just gon' hit you harder
Guard ya, stick ya, rip ya
Extended clip ya
Graze ya, blaze ya, hard to miss with the laser
You talk shit I (hawk spit) spit the razor
The mastermind, the muscle
Boy I know how to touch you
I plot it, plan it, then execute it dammit

[Hook]
You a killer, you that nigga, you put work in all the time
You a shooter it’s nothing to you, you maneuver with the 9
I heard it all before, I’m strapped coming at you boy
This what, beef or war? I get the drop, blow your face on the floor
I don’t believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop up on ya

[Verse 2]
Nigga make one false move around me I say “fuck it I’m ridin'”
And ain’t no sense in tryna duck me motherfucker I’ll find ya
I'm still goin' through my 50-niggas-everywhere-I-go phase
Catch me slippin' no days
You pussy niggas no way
To stop me you gon' need at least a Mack boy
Shoot me with a .25 I be like “what you do that for?”
That party popper ain’t gon' cut it
But once you crossed the line you crossed the line nigga so fuck it
I’m built for it
Try to do the shit I do get killed for it
Pints of blood spill for it
Beef I’m still for it
Niggas wanna bump with Ferrari, prolly they ain’t get the memo
I got cake, it’s your wake
My gun or money make a nigga put a mask on
Shoot a head or break a leg, put a cast on

[Hook]



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Say man, we don't need much to come to the freak show (SMS Audio)
Come to the freak show

Shit, citation, think quick, lick my cock, baby
Time's money, check my Tourbillon Movement.

Looking ain't hard to tell who's winning, who's loosing
Got a penthouse around my wrist, I'm flashing out

I got whips for days, I got kick for days
Louis, Hermes, [?] Jimmy Choo's

Zip down my zipper and play with the python

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Girl, I´m not into all that S&M shit
The leather spikes not for me but you can get your ass whiped
Limited time, skip the foreplay

Hope the head games's good, she looking exotic
Seven hour flight, she already 'rotic
London, Paris, France, Japan
Talk to me while we fuck, girl, I can't understand
Let's get to stroking, boning, moaning, groaning
Start in the afternoon, end up the next morning
Start the next round, lick from my neck down
So she did do, felatio correct. Wow!

So everything you do to me I'll do to you

Zip down my zipper, play with the python

You gon' be just be like that?
You so insensitive, hurt my feelings
I mean from the bottom of my heart
I love you



[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Intro]
Yo, I'd like to dedicate this to my mom, Sabrina Jackson
God bless her soul
We gon' get it on in here; nothing but real shit

[Verse 1]
Yo, shorty ain't a shorty no more; shorty be wil'ing
Shorty adolescent ass belong on the island
I went from riding big wheels to wanting to be a big Willy
Found interest in drug dealers and cold-hearted killers
Could it be it's in my blood cause my mom sold drugs?
She used to bust slugs and surround herself by thugs
Made mistakes by showing them love
And they killed her
Some friends never came to pay respects, so fuck Hilda
You know how friends do friends - like Tony did Manolo
The type of fast shit that Henry did in Good Fellas
Some snakes don't show up to weights cause they backs is yellow
When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow muthafuckers, I'mma break it down iller
See, 'Preme was a business man - you guess who the killer
Remember? He used to push the bulletproof BM (uh huh)
His hair'll get you seasick; I sat back and peeped shit
They roll with E-Z Wider, and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for fifty or five hundred
What about bug, who trade and them niggas had cheese?
In the late 80s push Mercedes
And Maseratis, kept reserved spaces at the horse races
Where they met Columbian connections like Lucho and Mariella
Then bookoo bucks on the horses; they used to cook and flip bricks
Faster than the jet flip flap jack and pack gats
Niggas said Ds was dipping, burned his face with acid
'Til this day, they would say the mothefucker's gasted

[Hook]
It's my confession; I make corrections; I strive for perfection
I try to be the best in, whatever I do; I'm telling you
This is my confession; I'm teaching niggas a lesson
Cause they can't do, what I do; here's my confession

[Verse 2]
Yo, a lot of New York blocks are only bringing pennies in
I stand beef - too many cheaps; too little fucking Indians
Too many sips of the brew will make you do what we do
Play with insecurities, until we start fussing and cussing
Frustration builds - few lose, and fist fights leave niggas busting
Not only do we have to look out and avoid encounters with Jake
Gotta look out and avoid encounters with snakes
Niggas who fake and play both sides of the gate
I squeeze Boyz II Men for they cheese like Michael Bivins
Slip with half a big nigga cap like Robert Givens
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze will leave you confused
And if you watch the news, you'll see some players in this game and lose
Niggas think they together; they ain't together at all
Stand on the block together, but divided they fall
A lot of niggas locked down and ain't got nobody to call
And a player ain't the same player when he can't ball

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me - the type that keep the bricks flipping
Jewels dripping, the margarita sipping - description
Nappy blowouts shaped up, brown-skinned
And ask the hood rats about my dick; the chickens recommend it
I make statements like "Try me if you want"
Presentation: cool and calm - words as if I'm daring ya
Usually roll with a 2 shot .25 derringer
I'm not an actor; my life's not a movie
I never worked with the Fugees
I'm not killing you softly; pack a small gat just to back you up off me
But later when things simmer and all sin ceases
My peoples will see to it that you rest in peace in pieces
Kill or be killed - it's what the hood teaches
Never go to church so the preachers can't reach us
And if we do, it's only on Easter

[Hook]

{*set to the "If I Could Go" instrumental by Angie Martinez*}

[50 Cent]
Yeah...
She like it she love it, she kiss it she suck it
She want me to want it, she want to climb up on it
Smile, ha ha... {yeah, Lloyd Banks} (ha ha ha...)
50 Cent (yeah...) {*SHADYVILLE~!*}

[Lloyd Banks]
Mami we can, creep through the ghetto wit'cha, feet in stilletos
Hit the, club and party as long as you sneak in the metal (YEAH~!)
Or we can head to the house, from the house it's the floor
From the, floor to the couch, from the, couch to the door (WOO!)
Then it's, out to the store or, out to the mall
Watchin, out for the law, cause of this pouch full of raw
I don't care how much you love her don't, vouch for the whore
Cause the first chance she get I'm in her mouth on the tour (WHAT?)
I'm lovin the ladies, with no husbands or babies
Since little I've been active, lost dozens of babies (C'MON!)
Gettin a hummer stuntin, in your cousin Mercedes
Or roll up on you dumpin, pourin guns at your 80's (WHAT~?!)
You the man on your block? I'm the talk of the town
That's probably why they wanna see me in chalk in the ground
But you can find me on the corner with a pack of marijuana
Middle finger to haters nigga you fuckin with the greatest

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Yes, I wanna go, to a mo-tel
Just for fo' hours, only short stay
We don't have to go, far far away
To have some fun, try things my way
Bitch grab your bag, get in the Escalade
Put the seat back, we're onnn our way
There's no games to play, nothin else to say
Listen to your man, you'll like things my way

[Lloyd Banks]
You make me wanna, rest in the tower make a, mess in her flowers
How 'bout, sex in the shower or, neck for an hour (AOWWWW~!)
You got a ring on your finger even, one in your nose
Squeezin some on your toes, runnin your tongue like lobes
Ohh remember spin the bottle? You coulda been a model
While you begin to swallow, niggas in Timbs tomorrow
No love, no hoes, no paper
Nah no ice, no Mo', there's no acre
Your bitch look good I'ma take her
Won't have to fight to make her the first -
{*abruptly ends*}



[Hook]
We can do whatever it is you want that you want to do
Long as I can spend the whole night with you

Hennessy sippin' (got me a bottle)
Bacardi drinkin' (got me a bottle)
Smirnoff sippin' (got me a bottle)
Absolut shorty (got me a bottle)
Tangueray sippin' (got me a bottle)
Absolut drinkin' (got me a bottle)
E&J sippin' (got me a bottle)
Champaigne drinkin' (got me a bottle)

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm gettin' tipsy off a bottle of Bacardi
Wit' a model at a party
I got kids, but mommy gon' be swallowin' pro'lly
See I always get my way girlfriend, I'm spoiled bad
Keep my hydro stashed in a Crown Royal bag
Your performance will determine the price
See if you fuckin' to champaigne, but if not it's Smirnoff Ice
And 9 times outta 10, I was pissy when I was with you
But they don't make a liquor strong enough for me kiss you, nah

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
I don't fuck wit' scurry ass niggas
That ain't got a care in the world
I'm fin' to drink this motherfucker right here till I hurl
Admit it, I'm that motherfuckin' nigga you lovin'
New York nigga, soundin' like I'm straight up southern
What bitch, don't try to play me close to see what I'm drinkin'
Yeah I'm rich, I ain't a trick, what the fuck are you thinkin'
I'm some type a nigga that ain't 'bout that money man
If I smack you in your face you get funny man
Ha ha

[Hook]

[Intro]
I'm so so serious
I'm oh so serious
I, I got it

[Hook]
Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray, my Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die though before I awake
Let my niggas celebrate and split my cake

[Verse]
It's 50, I'm so real, you ain't see none realer
Ex-crack dealer, I click-clack for the skrilla
I'm heartless, something like a cold-blooded killer
I'm filthy, dirty with the money, my nigga
I done ran through more cars than your Rolls Royce dealer
I put that on my Goddaughter, I love you, Jon Miller
New Bentley or not, watch the chinchilla
Sean Don spitter, Banshee four wheeler
I'm big in New York, I move like Godzilla
Gorilla, U.N.I.T Nigga
Grave digger, ask Puffy and Jigga
Made nigga, my pockets get bigger
And bigger, you got no choice but to feel a
Nigga when I spit that shit, I figure
It'll only bring more bread
You fuck around, I get down and go upside yo' head

[Hook]
Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray, my Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die though before I awake
Let my niggas celebrate and split my cake
Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray the Lord forgive me for holding heat
If I should die though before I awake
Let my niggas celebrate and split my cake

[Outro]
Oh! I just got back from the UK
A lil jet-lagged from the flight
But when I'm out there, they say...
They say, "50, 50 you're my favorite
We love you, 50! You're massive
Mash it up, there is no competition
No, no, there is no competition
You have to be kidding"
I can't believe it, I'm drunk!
It's 50, yeah



Yeah, Im back baby, you miss me? (Ha Ha)Come hear

[Hook]
Baby when I told you, you're the only one I like
I meant to say, I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight
And baby when I told you, you're the sunshine of my life
I meant to say, shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please I ain't buying you shit

[Verse 1]
When I told you I like you for everything you are
I meant I like the way your titties sit up in your bra
Everything I said in your ear by the bar
Was just to get you in the back seat of my car
You're an inspiring actress, girl you could go far
If you knew who I knew, baby you would be a star
But when I told you, you had sexy lips
I meant to say I bet you suck a good dick
And when I said I was feeling ya hips
I meant to say, I bet she like it like a dog and shit
So tell me doc, am I really sick?
When bitches find out how I think, they say I ain't shit
When I say I love it, I mean I like it a lot
I say I wanna fuck, I mean right on the spot
I say it's my pussy, but bitch you know it's yours
You say it's your dick, okay then lick on the balls

[Hook]
Baby when I told you, you're the only one I like
I meant to say, I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight
And baby when I told you, you're the sunshine of my life
I meant to say, shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please I ain't buying you shit

[Verse 2]
When I said I miss you, I mean I ain't hit in a while
I was thinking I come over, I'm thinking I can knock you down
When I said just kiss it, I mean come on just suck me off
I said I'll take you shopping, I meant I'll drive you to the mall
I wanna keep in touch, you know I hardly ever call
I'm doing big things, but I like my money short
You lookin' good baby, I complement you on your clothes
I mean them jeans ya wearing, I can't wait to take 'em off
I bet I get ya hot, I mean hotter than a stove
I'll be ya freak, ya freak, yeah I'll lick ya I suppose
I mean from your neck, all the way down to your toes
I won't miss a spot, I'm good at this, lord knows
Now here I go again, I mean I wanna get it on
I say anything, I'm a horny little dawg
Put ya legs back, and hop on you like a frog
Get religious quick, have you saying my god

[Hook x2]
Baby when I told you, you're the only one I like
I meant to say, I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight
And baby when I told you, you're the sunshine of my life
I meant to say, shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please I ain't buying you shit



I guess this is 6 out of 6 muthafuckers

[Hook]
Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I’m coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I’ma get ya boy

[Verse 1]
I threw a b-boy style, bullet wound in my smile
That beef I cook it, niggas I gets down
Call it what you want, the clip, the ladder, banana
I bet when I squeeze it, niggas scatter
The hoes, that’s a whole different story
Find out the baby ain’t mine, right there on Maury
Me I make the whip fishtail, trunk full of fishscale
Raw market itself, sucka the shit sell
That’s 36 o’s of love, give me kiss, give me love
Get to talking in codes, the phones bugged
This Ferrari I get to the green, half man, hald machine
(Tu, tu, tu) I’m on ya head with the beam
So focused ferocious, I shoot ya pretty ass out them Gucci loafers
You’re fucking with the wrong one
The strong one that God gave the gift
Stop the hater shit, you wanna make it
Why would you be mad, I done made it bitch

[Hook: 50 Cent + Freeway]
Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I’m coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I’ma get ya boy
(Get get gully, g-g-get gully
Get get gully, g-g-get gully
We get gully and we get money
Them schemin' ass chicks can’t get shit from me)

[Verse 2]
Rain drops from heaven, the angels are cryin'
It’s raining outside, envision my gun firin'
Red and white flashes, the police coming
Nigga you ain't hittin' none, why the fuck are you running
I make your momma wish your ass was a stillborn
When that eagle get to chirping on the front lawn
Where’s teh love, I don’t know but here’s the snub
Sucker barrel swallow the slug, die like a thug
You know it’s really not worth it
To fuck with me, you’d rather tongue kiss the serpent
Don’t cry we all die
It’s just a matter of time
Nigga one shot from the nine will shatter your spine
Uh, the last of my breed, criminal tendencies inside of an emcee
Fuck around I will line you
Run from me, I will find you
Forgot I’m nice, I will remind you

[Hook: 50 Cent + Freeway]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
One, two, fifty coming for you
Three, four, better lock ya door
Five, six, grab ya crucifix
Seven, eight, don’t stay up late
The monsters back
Yeah, I need a target
So I can smash their head
I’m nice!



[Intro: 50 Cent]
You want some of this?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
Nigga, it's on
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
You better be gone
It could be in the late night or in the morn'
Shells will bend your ass up - word is born
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
Nigga, it's on
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
You better be gone
It could be in the late night or in the morn'
Shells will bend your ass up - word is born

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You say you a shooter; nobody believes you
I don't say I'm a shooter; I just shoot if I need to
Gat bust
Adrenaline rush
High off dust
Rap tycoon
Mossberg boom
Nigga, I go through ya whole set
I come through ya hood bumpin' Bobby Womack
Old school, new school
Nigga, don't move
I run up right behind your ass, lightin' up the tool
Nigga, what?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
Nigga, it's on
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
You better be gone
It could be in the late night or in the morn'
Shells will bend your ass up - word is born
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
Nigga, it's on
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
You better be gone
It could be in the late night or in the morn'
Shells will bend your ass up - word is born

[Bridge: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, nigga
50, nigga
You know what time it is
The Talk of New York

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
I'm like a Mexican drug lord - my cash come quicker
I'm sittin' on bricks like a Columbian nigga
Movin' coke - a lot of that white shit
On the Amtrak, comin' back with this dyke chick
And this white bitch
Man I just bought a nice whip
Chi-Chi get that Yayo; homie toss that brick
They lovin' my product
They fiendin' to buy it
Man, I got these fiends gettin' skinny like Bohemian Diets
Po-Po they creep pass
Man, I peep task
They lookin' at my face cause I shoot like Steve Nash
The Llama in the truck
Baby mama baggin' up
Got Medina in the cut
So these fiends ballin' up

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
Nigga, it's on
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
You better be gone
It could be in the late night or in the morn'
Shells will bend your ass up - word is born
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
Nigga, it's on
When you hear that... (gun cocking)
You better be gone
It could be in the late night or in the morn'
Shells will bend your ass up - word is born

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You hear that boy, Yayo
Ah, man
It's crazy
You just 'gon give 'em that for free?
Ah, man
I'm puttin' this shit out man
Tony Yayo man...
2nd quarter
AH!

[Intro]
(Don't wake me, I'm dreaming)
It feels like a dream

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm dreaming big, real big, I got big dreams
I'll kill 'em this year, I got big schemes
It's bigger than coke, it's bigger than dope
My marijuana mentality went up in smoke
I go hard, so hard there ain't nothing harder
Poor or rich, my nigga, I hustle regardless
'Til I die and touch the sky
I'll be trying to get my piece of the pie
Shoot me or love me or hate me or leave me alone
The jealousy's growing cause I'm in the zone
The underground king, I'm on the throne
Cause niggas just ain't on the shit that I'm on
What I've been through shift my mental
It sounds like murder on the instrumental
I tend to spaz, I went through cash
So fast gotta get me some more

[Verse 2: Christopher Williams]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I can't get over the fact that I'm with you
Now that I have you I don't know what to do
Girl, if I'm dreaming I'm dreaming 'bout you
About the things that I'd like to do

[Chorus]
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you

[Verse 3: Christopher Williams]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I've been waiting for such a long time
For you to say that you would be mine
Now that you're here here by my side
I can't control the way that I feel inside

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone

[Verse 4]
Don't wake me up cause Clean Cut's dreaming
In a deep sleep my mind keeps scheming
I heard she had a man, I said ''so what?''
She be looking skinny then honey get donut
And I wanna taste her, straight up chase her
We can do this now if not then maybe later
Front to back, in fact I keep her screaming
For you I'm fiending, girl, you got me dreaming

[Bridge]
If I'm dreaming about you let's make this dream come true
If I'm dreaming about you let's make this dream of love come true

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Christopher Williams]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
This dream is just, just you and me

Bartender bring the bottles of Rose

Bitch, my drop top, make niggas feel like theres something wrong with there hustle

Scrap the plate move the weight I got the itis
I’m sick, I’m addicted to the gold
You take a hit of how this feel you want more
Sorta like what crack did to boogie and New Jack
Wassup when I crossover, there ain't no coming back
Take a hit of this, this is what I’ve been cooking
Perfect product, customer good looking
This trip, this flip, I’ma get the count right
Do my numbers man, why your baker count light
Thta work you put out, that was stepped on
My shit raw dope, pur heron

[Hook]
Bartender bring the bottles of Rose

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
Here it is nigga, 1000 grams of uncut
Take it off consignment, fuck up and you’re f-cked
This is certified hood shit, ghetto gold good shit
Sniff a line of this, take a pull of that
This a fact, either which way you hiding that
I’ve been here before, it’s so familiar
Bag up, fill up the paraphernalia
I wanna win so bad, nigga I wanna kill ya
Get in the way, I’m six spray I’m bad news
Denzel when the trumpet blow, more better blues
It’s psychotic, my flows are narcotic
Tll me how you want it, my nigga I got it
For days, My money give me goose bumps
My pockets swollen, two lumps
Count it all, 10c no cent a dime
You know me, you know I got a hell of a grind

[Hook]

There's nothing to it
I can smell hater
You know what this is
G-G-G-G-G, G-G-G-G-G
G-Unit
This is therapy for me man
I just gotta focus on my art. I’m an artist
You can appreciate it
Like you appreciate a Picasso
Or an Andy Warhol, you should love me
When you look at me
You should say this is fresh
This is abstract
This is a work of art
This is 50
Til next time, G-G-G-G-G-unit



[Intro]
Yeah, this is what you call inner city blues
Now that I got you here I got your attention (I'm a winner winner)
I wanna welcome you all to the winner's circle

[Hook]
I'm a winner winner, look I gotta win
After I win I got to win over again
Please don't confuse a nigga for a loser
Watch me maneuver with the Ruger
Look, I gotta win

[Verse 1]
By any means, I'm a 7 or 11
Trip'-6 or a Cee-Lo, you ain't hear that from me though
My occupation's operation get money
Got that beam on that 9, got that money on my mind
Got no patience, man, I grind like I'm running out of time
See the sunshine reflect off my shine, you're blind
You write hot lines like mine lines you're signed
That bitch bad, her ass so fat class, she mine
I'm addicted to it, me I got to win
Over and over and over again
This quest for the paper is never gon' end
So to my competition here's the message I send

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man, you ain't a shooter, you ain't a robber
You talk like a mobster you fucking blogger
I say some hard shit you wanna say somethin harder
Smack the shit out you, you wanna run to the law, huh?
This movie's a rerun, you seen this before
She used a vibrator and she suck on your boy
I stand out like a sore thumb, I'm hard to ignore
You get addicted to the dick then have to go through withdrawls
After I go through the drawers I'm back on my grizzly
Back getting busy causing a frenzy
It's nothing new to me, there's nothing they could do to me
That ain't been done to me - this is fun for me

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
Yeah, F-50

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die
You think I'm all poinry, cause you see me gettin' high
But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye

As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die
You think I'm all poinry, cause you see me gettin' high (yeah)
But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye

[Verse 1 - Tony Yayo]
740 I, with the brand new shake (uh huh)
Got me pissin' on hoes like the R. Kelly tape
If you see me in the club, nothin' but Cris poppin' (yeah)
See me in court, my lawyers plea bargainin' (woo)
Tryin' to turn a 3 to 6, to a 2 to 4 (uh huh)
Or 1 to 3, for an extra G
RIP to Etho, I miss Hevo
When I die, I hope heaven look like the ghetto (yeah)
Picture me trick, and take a loss
I'm cheap like the Chinese man with duck sauce
This Tony homey, I walk around with a big chrome
9 L's will hit ya passenger, hit ya driver
G-Unit, you don't know a fuckin' clique liver
(You heard my nigga, you don't know a fuckin' clique liver)

[Chorus]
As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die (yeah)

But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye (eye)

As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die
You think I'm all poinry, cause you see me gettin' high
But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye

[Verse 2 - Tony Yayo]
I never mix money and product with my friends (uh huh)

And been on the block, ever since bunny tops (c'mon)
250 grizzies, scrape the plate (scrape that plate)
Got me on 750's straight from the plate (straight from the plate)
You can call on your soldiers, call your recruits (uh huh)
I do you dirty like Raheem did Dirty is "Juice" (Juice)
Allow myself, to introduce myself
This is Tony, the talk of New York, I'm holdin' the belt
I got thug in my blood (blood), game like a pimp (pimp)
And wrote my first verse, takin' baths in the sink (yeah)
And yo I fear no man son, I never heard of a fair one
Never gotta borrow a handgun
Niggas on the street, gettin' smoked like bran son
So I stay dirty like "Sanford and Son" (yeah)
Groupies gossipin' stay runnin' their lips (woo)
Cause they seen the Gucci seats in the 6 (uh huh)
And seen the Fendi grips on the four fifth (what)
Shit, I sell bricks, shit, I sell shit on a stick (stick)
Enough of the talkin', let's take it to the valance (uh huh)
The New York streets, will leave you physically challenged (challenged)
Don't be surprised, If I spit at you
Then come to your wake, and serve fiends at your funeral
Our bread is goin' towards a brick of dope
Cause I've been goin' hand and hand since "Different Strokes"
I'm a 50, an eighth, you a half a blunt
You the nigga in the mirror that practice stunts
WHAT!

Yall niggas know me man

And it's how it gets flipped
That's why you feelin' me bitch
Niggas hate from a far

Chorus (x2)
You can find me In Da Club
Bottle full of Bub
My mind got what you need
You need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug
If you're into getting rubbed

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's always drama In Da Club
Now that I roll with Dre, everybody show me love
When you sell like Eminem, you get plenty of groupie love
And Homie ain't nothing changed
Rolls down, G's up, I see Xzibit in the cut, hey man, roll dat weed up
If you watch how I move you mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp
In Da Hood, In L.A., They saying "50 you hot!"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But, Holla, in New York, for sure, they tell you I'm loco
When the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a meal out the deal and I'm still on the grind
And shorty said she feelin' my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi, and they ready to go

Chorus (x2)
You can find me In Da Club
Bottle full of bub
Momma got what you need
You need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug
If you're into getting rubbed

(Bridge)
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look homie, I done up and I ain't changed
You should love it, way more than you hate it
Oh, you mad, I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
Moved out the hood now you trying to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumping In Da Club it's on
I wink my eye at you chicks
If she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn
If you're talking about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told 'cause go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up
Or we can go upside their head with a bottle of bub
C'mon, they know where we be Whew!!

Chorus (x2)
You can find me In Da Club
Bottle full of bub
Momma got what you need
You need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug
If you're into getting rubbed
(Laughing)

[Young Buck]
For those who couldn't figure me out, what this nigga be bout

Lettin' New York know these Unica niggas ain't stuntin'
Nigga we ain't runnin', I guarantee you that
After these messages we'll be right back
Take off that necklace a, because this tech will hit a
Innocent bystander who don't respect a nigga
After you finish your collard greens and cornbread
Get you a Glock, and come around here where my mom stayin'

[Hook]

[Skip]
From South I 95, 85, 65 right at the I 10, get your money widened

When you get close, call nigga I'm gonna guide you down
You got it now, (got it), well then what time you leavin'?
In a couple of hours, some time close to this evenin'
What us speed with V8, them cops then heated
They locked my partner Gus up for smokin' weed and speedin'
But he'll be home though, probably about the same time you get ya
Shit yeah, seems like we paid his bond like last year
But anyway, you know that thing we thought that was, but wasn't?
Well come to find out, my homey found somethin'
But he had to choke a bitch, and fo' pound somethin'
Cause I told him, what you told me about the chump and he chumped 'em
Put the barrel bottle pump, and pumped 'em
And pumped 'em and pumped 'em, and pumped 'em and pumped 'em

[Hook]

[Male voice talking]

Niggas crazy (keep on dreamin')
Think they gon' catch me slippin' (keep on dreamin')
I'm on point, nigga (I said keep on dreamin')

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
No two-face or mean mug, no mask, no gloves
Get you in my peripheral, I'm tearin' you up
I'm watchin', you probably think my eyes wide shut
I'm waitin' for you to cross the line and get fucked
I lean in a Lotus, take off like a rocket
Got your bitch outta pocket, my hustle, you can't knock it
Got paper like Citibank, nigga, you need a loan
Got a brain, use ya brain, or get ya brains blown
Watch my watch tick tock and get popped
See my chain gleam scheme
And get met with the beam, nah mean?
I'm not a freshman, I'm a senior, yeah, head of my class
I'll put a hollow tip head in yo' ass
You tryna jam me thinkin' I'm candy
Ain't nothin' sweet, I run the streets with all sorts of heat
You tryna eat, try elsewhere, my presence is felt here
You won't need wealth here, your ass'll get melt here
Nigga, yeah

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Ya niggas ain't maintaining, ya niggas is man-tanning
Black face, smack taste, I'll chew on your man standing
Fuck who you next to, nigga, I'll wet you
Splash vest, crash test, guess what this gat do
I'm getting upset, duke, guess I'm the Madd Rapper
First born on the horn saying, "yo, dad, slap 'em"
Fuck all these fuck-niggas, this is big Ruck, nigga
I'm a boss, you a ten off every buck, nigga
Ruck is a tough rapper, I got a Dutchmaster
Three dice in my hand sippin' a nut-cracker
I got the bank stop, you think broke, bitch, I think not
Twenty-five thousand dollar carpet like Frank got
Blot that shit, I'll pop that shit
That got niggas talkin' about callin' the cops and shit
You pussy, I'm the opposite, hardcore
Kevlar vest on my flesh in a large form, P

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Test me, you wan' die? Murder a lung now
Fresh of the projects, put ten on my neck
It's off limits, touch it, touch the sky
Touch it, I'll send you to ya dead homies to say hi
I break niggas into fractions, I'm down for that action
Talk that chopper talk 'til I come with the Colt
Then it's bye-bye, close your eyes, learn to fly
Why go through it, why try and test I?
When you know I ain't rap right, I'm strapped right
2-4-7, 3-6-5, I'm outside, steady mobbin'
I'm all in, I'm not the one you robbin'
Have me creepin', crawlin', shell cases fallin'
Bullet hit your leg, break your limb
Bullets hit your chest, make you slim
Bullets flyin', run away from them
Bullets miss you, hit your closest friend
You pussy, mane, you should've gave your toast to him

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Outro: Sean Price]

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Wise came home Far Rock edge, man; I figured I'd drop in (WHOOOO!)
Bless him with a lil' short change to go shoppin'! (YEAH!)
Buzzer don't work! - Elevator shitty staircase pissy
His sister ran out huggin' on a nigga, she missed me! (what?)
Momma living room, she sipped Cristy till she was pissy! (whoooo!)
Told 'em niggas tried to blaze me last night but they missed me
In the CL, some niggas wet the driver side door, (uh-huuuh!)
I had my vest on. - I put the fuckin\' pedal to the floor! (AAAAAHHHH!)
Her son facin' her - for a less or tens, he hurtin'
They be hollerin' like: "50, let us put some work in!"
Today's a nice day if tonight's a nice night, - somebody gon' die
It is what it is my nigga; why ask why?!
See? I stay with some s*it in the street
But the niggas Uptown love me like they love Pistol Pete. - You heard me?

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
Haha, haha!
BRAAAAAAAAAAAAATT!
Y'all n*ggas eat that, n*gga!
Live with that!

[Verse 2: Scarface]
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck bein a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me..

[Verse 3: Lloyd Bank$ {50 Cent}:]
I had my eyes on the Mascara, - mami, the Maybelline queen;
Dolce Gabana, Fergano gettin' choked in the sauna. [explosion]
She had a - dot on her face like Madonna, (Madonna!) dressed like she date a designer. (designer!)
Looks so good, I spent a day with her mama. {whoooo!}
Tried to break her, bring her, beat her, eat a plate of lasagna, {uh-huuuuh!}
Grab some paper, bring the heater in case it's haters behind her. {AAAAHH!}
They call me "Bandana Bank$", baby, I clap your homie, homie
Then I'm through with her, - go holla at Macaroni Tony, {TONY YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYO!}
In the back with a few cup of Henny, baggy pants to tuck the semi
In case you get to fuckin\' friendly. - My clique as tough as any! {any!}
Stuntin' plenty, I don't trick a penny; {haha!} get your own shit!
Callin' me with questions will only get you a phone click. - ! (!)

[Hook: Scarface]
I can squeeze without blinkin', I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta



[Intro]
Hello? Oh shit, nigga, oh shit
What the fuck is going on?

[Hook: 50 Cent (B.I.G.)]
(When I die fuck it, I wanna go to hell)

(Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion)
I know my momma wish she got a fucking abortion

[Verse 1]
Some niggas is broke, trying to be on some don shit
Me? I'm a grunt, comfortable in that conflict
Go 'head nigga stunt, it's cool 'til I get on it
You can keep the blunt, but that chain, nigga, we want it
Call it a jux or whatever you wanna call it
Call the police and get hit with a clip for it
You know how I move, that semi here on my waistline
Ain't nobody ever gave me shit, nigga, I take mine
I run in your crack house, Mac out screaming "Go 'head make me"
Duct-tape you, the fiends and that snotty nose baby
Calm down and cooperate 'fore I hit you
With some shit that doc'll operate for hours you coward

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I tried to keep it cool these hobby niggas make me violent
I split your fucking head, yeah, that would stop your ass from whining
Baby, I'm delusional, distorted, no defying
You think you can play me, pussy, go 'head, nigga, try it
I fell I broke my arm, I felt pain when I was six
They kill mommy at it, by 12 I was selling knicks
See me I'm a survivor, I tell a nigga suck a dick
And niggas know I'm strapped so they ain't saying shit
Me? I'm a party pooper, I be fucking up the fun
These niggas wanna stunt, I wanna get at 'em with my gun
Since a little nigga, I been on the same shit
Don't act like something new when you see niggas getting hit (What up, BIG?)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm Notorious
Biggie ain't around, now you need me, alright?
I'm Notorious
You can chill with 'Pac, nigga, in your next life
I'm Notorious

[Outro: 50 Cent]
It's 50, nigga, I'm back mashed, what's up?

Bright and early I want it

Baby now get up on it

You follow instructions
Then I follow instructions

More kissing and touching
Feels super natural
First chance I'm at you

[Ice Cube]
To fuck with Ice Cube
You gotta shit talk, big talk, Crip walk
Bang hard, run yards, flip cars
Cause you fucking with millionaires
Big stars
Only clocking a grip will make our
Dicks hard
I come through when I handle my
Business
Like a goddamn menace
Niggas think I eat spinach
Cause you need a dentist
Whenever I finish
It's the Grin-ich, with a gang of
Lieutenants
WESTSIDE!

[50 Cent]
I like it when you freaky
I’m freaky
I’ll explore your body completely
Til you feel like you need me
Chest to chest
I reckon I get to kiss you in neck
Come correct to make a sweat
It’s making us wet
Say my name, say my name
Positions we change
I ain’t joking girl, I’m stroking
I ain’t playing no games
Jackpot, backshot
Still roughly taken
My pleasure is pleasing you
You should feel the same too

[2Pac]
Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the
Penitentiary, still ballin'
Riding on these niggas cause they
Lame

Can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug
Nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than
The drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to
Bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas
Hit em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger Lord forgive me if
I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, I'll fuck her
From the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's
Where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggas wonder
Why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see
Who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen
Many peers dead
Niggas still ballin

Step up in this motherfucker
Just a-swanging my hair
Bitch quit talking, Crip walk
Stay down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take
This dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down
For the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut
Yo' trap

Success
If you believe in the S you'll be
Relieving your stress

They wanna see me Bleeding
When the Times get harder
I Grind harder From the Bottom soles of my feet
They wanna see me Bleeding
My Blood's always thicker than water
Even tho,the waters run deep
They wanna see me bleeding
Through tha Pain,l just grit my teeth
Through the flames I just take on the heat
Through my vains runs the heart of the street
Ain't nothing change I’m a stay on my G`s
So what they want from me? They wanna see me bleeding

How did I get in here, life is a livin hell
The walls are closing in it feels Like im trapt in prision cell
They pray for me to fail
But in my face they wish me well
But still I persevere
Deal with hand I was dealt
They neva gave me nothing every thing I got myself
So they can't tell me nothing Still they all in my grill
Try to claim that they real
Try to tell me they love me
But noone was ever there
They wanna see me bleeding
I never been scared
There ain't nothing I fear
Look in my eyes and u can see the soul of a man
They just dont understand
I walk with my gun in my hand I bust up in the air
Give niggas a runnin chance
A soldier in the trinchez A wreisel in the fire
See im that young nigga OG's hate to admire
Its the hate that inspires
My love for getting rich and im'a die tryin

They wanna see me Bleeding
When Times get harder
I Grind harder From the Bottom souls of my feet
They wanna see me Bleeding
My Blood's always thicker than water
Even tho,the waters run deep
They wanna see me bleeding
Through tha Pain,i just grit my teeth
Through the flames I just take on the heat
Through my vains runs the heart of the street
Ain't nothing changed I’m a stay on my G`s
So what they want from me? They wanna see me bleeding

Man im ready to ride
Why they want me to die
They wanna live my life
I can see the hate in they eyes
Somebody tell me why
When I look in the sky
He dont ever look down
I guess that he dont hear my cries
Please show me a sign
That I got enough time
To get outta the grind
A gettin in the shine
I’m tryn to hold it down
But I ain't worried man,what goes around comes around
They wanna see me Bleeding
My backs against the wall
Niggas is all talk come on talk no bite niggas is all bark
Im the light in the dark
I ignite like a spark
The pimpin in me will never die Preach what mama told ya
Go an get what u want and remember the south cause u never know where u goin if You dont know where ur from
So I lifted the trunk and chunked the deuce sideways break them boys off

They wanna see me Bleeding
When Times get harder
I Grind harder From the Bottom souls of my feet
They wanna see me Bleeding
My Blood's always thicker than water
Even tho,the waters run deep
They wanna see me bleeding
Through tha Pain,i just grit my teeth
Through the flames I just take on the heat
Through my vains runs the heart of the street
Ain't nothing changed I’ma stay on my G`s
So what they want from me? They wanna see me bleeding

[Outro]
Nanananananaaaaaaa(Yeahh)
They wanna see me bleeding
Nanananananaaaaaaa(uh huh )
They Wanna see(come on) me bleeding

Evrything ain't what it seems
Take a look at wat I see
One eye on the prize the other on my enemies
They wanna see me Bleeding
When Times get harder
I Grind harder From the Bottom souls of my feet
They wanna see me Bleeding
My Blood's always thicker than water
Even tho,the waters run deep
They wanna see me bleeding
Through tha Pain,i just grit my teeth
Through the flames I just take on the heat
Through my vains runs the heart of the street
Ain't nothing change I’m a stay on my G`s
So what they want from me? They wanna see me bleeding



[Intro]
I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
My bitch just like me so I know she wanna stunt
A taste of the good life, yeah, I know what she want
A trip to PR, sex in the car, floating diamonds shabar
Call us hood, it's all good, that's what we are
Find an exotic space to visit, chinchilla, gator-lizid
That's how a nigga gets it when I'm on my shizzit
Bright lights, city life, a nigga so flashy
Have you like “Damn! That Ferrari flew past me!”
So fast a nigga don't know limits
Had a bad bitch in it, I can see it wasn't tinted
Get the money then spend it, break rules or bend it
To my liking, I move like a viking
A warrior, I shouldn't mean more to you
I'm the American dream, one man regime
Shorty love me like she love new shoes
Insecure, so she investigate me like the feds, ooh

[Hook]
Funny how time flies when we're making love
It goes on and on and on, we just can't go wrong

[Verse 2]
They can smile, they can frown, they can love it, they can hate it
They can wish bad shit on us, it's cool, we made it
Look at me to see the Lord's blessings while they stressing
Switch whips, push the Bugatti through the recession
It's just me and you, I can see it clear
Police coming, I need you to stash this pistol here
It's all hood, you hesitate they'll put our life on pause
It's a common wealth state, baby, they make up laws
Fuck CMB, it's you and me, baby, we all we got
I say we gon' make it, they sayin' we not
Yeah, but they don't know I'm meant for you, they don't know how you're into me
They don't know shit about how we bond mentally
Their relationships are oh so basic
They can't understand how we do and how we say shit
So blunt, don't front, I got you open
It's the original G shit, you know how we get, duck down

[Hook]

I "Hit 'Em Up" worse than Pac, watch me

[ Verse 1 ]
I don't hesitate to pull out the Burna nigga
I stick my snub nose in shit, that don't concern a nigga
I'm the reason that Coupe, ain't got no top
I'm the reason that Rouger, ain't got no shots
And when I squeeze, I tend to keep on squeezin'
If your lucky, you can run, and keep on breathin' (yeah)
When my knife hit ya windpipe and you start wheezin' (huh)
You put your hand over the hole, and it gonna stop the breathin' (woo)
I am what I am, and I ain't gonna change
My 5th clip loaded to the tip, I'll blow out ya brains
Trust me, I'm not what you used to homie (grrr)
You little faggot, I'll tell ya fuckin' boss to blow me (uh huh)
I'm puttin' pressure on you, you payin' the pump (yeah)
About to die like a man, but you live like a chump (uh huh)
I only walk wit a limp, when I walk wit a pump
I can't wait to see you scatter, when I pull out and dunk ya (TAKE THAT)

[ Hook ]
50, it's 50, it's 50, motherfucker (uh huh)
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back motherfucker (I'm back)
Niggas thought they got me
9, 9 shells couldn't stop me
I "Hit 'Em Up" worse than Pac, watch me (do it up nigga)

50, it's 50, it's 50, motherfucker
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back motherfucker (uh huh)
Niggas thought they got me
9, 9 shells couldn't stop me
I "Hit 'Em Up" worse than Pac, watch me

I warned you, told you not to fuck around
But you never listen, so you go ahead and fuck around!

[Verse]
I told y'all I crush 'em, I crushed them, it’s nothing

Got my thinking cap on, now I'm sharp as a blade
Don't believe me you sit there and watch me get paid
New game, homie, my next move is always my best move
Stricktigic, I show you motherfucker’s my chess move
Believe it, I'm not that rapper nigga you used to
That hammer hit that shell that hollow tip will go threw you
Contact hop, smoke from the cronic got me fellin damonic
Shoot one in the head for any nigga that want it
I prepare for the worst and wish for the best
40 Cali on my hip, teflon on my chest
It’s toughful math, niggas get blast, D’s canning it up
Feel the crime scene playin' DA, mad as fuck
Hit my voice 'em on the wire tap, now you can get me like that
So called investigation, just was time [?] wasted
You call me Palli, call me son, call me don dotta
50, I break 'em off proper!

[Hook x2]
I warned you, told you not to push me, pussy
See what happens when you push me, pussy
I warned you, told you not to fuck around
But you never listen, so you go ahead and fuck around!



[Intro]
Its 50, Yeah
It's time I laid back on Em'
Real smooth yeah

[Chorus: x2]
I'm not down for the mind sex

You can burn an in-scent
Lay back and relax
Feel the good vibrations
After me fuck I don't a conversation

[Verse 1]
Pardon me love that ass lookin' right
What you doin' tonight
You should stop aight
My body language say it all
So we ain't gotta talk

Now you know I wanna fuck
No doubt but I wanna try a different route
Don't say a word
Un-button your blouse
Pull that skirt down
Come to my bed time to put it down

[Chorus: x2]
I'm not down for the mind sex
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet
You can burn an in-scent
Lay back and relax
Feel the good vibrations
After we fuck I don't a conversation

[Verse 2]
New princess show me your interests
Wait let me guess you like my ghetto poetry
Here's a little something I wrote down
In case you ever came around
You hear that fly shit
You know it's me
Position after position
I'll exploit your body
Like an instructor for yoga or advanced Pilates
Your working up a sweat
You like it how I like it?
Go ahead go up and down
I like it when you ride it

[Chorus: x2]
I'm not down for the mind sex
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet
You can burn an in-scent
Lay back and relax
Feel the good vibrations
After we fuck I don't a conversation

[Outro]
Motherfuckin' right I don't want no conversation
Talk to a bitch try to explain to her why she should give me some boyzes and the bitch slow. First she know then she don't know if she gonna give some boyzes, she slow. So I ain't supposed to be hangin' out with no mentally retarded ho, you know shit like that, you know what I'm sayin'? It's the kid man, It's the 50 man. Come on man, I'm in Taiwan man,type A, Thailand

Why I got a hundred mill' and you ain't got nuttin', huh?



[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, she so vicious, sweet kisses, taste delicous
Maybe this is who I should make the misses
Let's conversate a little like a fiddle, play with the middle
They way she shake when it wiggle, I mean she hot like a kettle
Well, me I'm strapped with the metal when I go hard for the bread
So I line you up and I dent you, you run you're fucked when I catch you
You only eat cause I let you, I hate the fact that I met you
When you could say that you know me and act like I'm your homie

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Touch me, tease me, feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go, baby, I'm about to explode
Cause all my love you can control

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
She scratch my back when I'm stroking, she scream she like it, she open
I'm sitting back while she sucking, she super freaky, I love it
The sex is better than basic, that kitty kat, yeah, I chase it
She do it just how I like it, position after position
Fast stroke, short stroke, deep stroke, listen
She down for pushing her limits, that's why I'm pushing up in it
Start kissing her lips then I'm kissing her neck
When my tongue cause her tata, bet it get wet to it, easy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Case]
I'll spend the night with you
If you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream
And you know just what I mean
Cause tonight you taste like ice cream
I wanna make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again
And again, and again, and again
Don't go away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Let me get that Lex, nigga
Sex wetter than aquariums
Flashing, they get their ass in
Who fucks slow with lear jets and coupes
My ones stacking
You ain't know that I be macking
The extra set of keys, the thirty G's
Them chips, the bellies, had you living on your knees
Not to mention the laced out crib in Dallas
The fourty room palace sipping cristal-ise

[Chorus]

[Intro] (50 Cent)
I love niggas! I love niggas!
Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that 'presents me
I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!!)
I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again)
And to all niggas that do it I love

[B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (You niggas understand?!)
To all my Bronx (It's war nigga)
To all my Queensbridge (I'll blow you away)

[Verse: B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's real

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (2x)
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Verse: B.I.G.]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop Watertown
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo Chief, pass the Buddha

[Chorus]

[Verse: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand-to-hand
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I catch a new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up wit octane I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, bump my shit, bitch!

[Chorus]



Chorus (4x):
Pray and pray
And pray for my downfall

Menace, scene from the movie
Clap the two, weigh the oozie
Goodfella jewelry heist
Diamonds in my bitch doobie
I sit back, think about the cats
They hate man I laugh at them
Get outta line I blast at them
They stay scheming
Fuck around let off a clip
And leave the whip leaning
They dreaming
I took the cream and
Move to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, shit
Cause when I flip
I make the paper
Dangerous, G-Unit
Niggas can't bang with us
It's undeniable the kid is nice
The flow CPR
I'll bring Biggie back to life
Man, Dre say I'm loony
Em say I'm moody
At least I don't smoke oolies
And fuck without rubbers
A handful of niggas hate
But the hood love us
You can pray
For my downfall
Motherfuckers

(Chorus 8x)

Even if I slip
I'll get back
Nigga act up
Hollowtips'll
Tear your back up
Gain 30 pounds
When you die, no lie
I was high when they hit me
Had a few gats with me, shit
Ain't get a chance to let off
They shot me up and sped off
Apologies in order
Tamia I adore her
But now they strict
Cause my flow make money
Flow like water
Turn it up a notch
Twist the dutch
Zone to this, soak it up
See me in the club son
I'll send niggas to poke you up
You know my style 40 cal
With me when I move around
Squeeze, catch the shell
And run before your ass
Hit the ground
Pussy niggas shouldn't talk
Keep my name out your mouth
Summerjam, understand
I'm the man
When I leave the crowd leave
Shook closer, game over
Ride or get rolled over

(Chorus 8x)



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, nigga, yeah
Yeah nigga, yeah
Yeah nigga

[Hook]
I'm a paper chaser, my Glock I'll fire it
You know what it is
The moment you expired, I handle my biz
I make somethin' outta nothin'
You fuck with the kid
You bound to get shot frontin' (2x)

[Verse 1]
You got that big body Benz, ha
You find the bitch that you want
You just treat her and her friend, ha
You don't fucked up that coke, ha
Them niggas mad as a mothafucker
They finna get you smoked, ha

Waitin' with the hammers to put a hole in yo chest, ha
It's hot you wearin' your vest, ha
It's summer time and you can't even go out
Nigga you stressed, ha
They talkin' about you in the hood, ha
They sayin' yo ass can't come around
You sayin' you could, ha
That bitch flip gave you the boot, ha
She ain't fuckin' nigga with you
Cause you ain't got no loot, ha
Ain't nothin' left for you to do, ha
So you back in the hood with your pistol ready to shoot, ha
It won't be long before you dead, ha
Niggas paid me to hit ya I gotta put one in yo head now!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, it's my summer!
Go 'head say somethin', I want you to say somethin'
So I can smacke the fuckin' black off you, nigga
I spit in yo face, faggot
Come through there man, I can't wait, man
Summer time we gon' mash out this year, nigga

Ya' niggas don't want it with me now, man
What the fuck, man, ya'll now where I come from

You know the rules!
Live this summer or die this summer, babe
It's real!



I’m in the club tryna get me some hoes
Or, I’m on the grind tryna get me some dough
I hustle hard, niggas already know
I do what I gotta do and proceed to keep it moving
Holla at me if you’re ready to roll
I ain't gotta tell you I want you, you already know
I keep my eye on you, while you out on the floor
Girl, you turn me on, watching you move to the music

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
I’mma flash the cash you know I’ma get it
You wanna give me the ass, you know I’m with it
The flows so sick the way I spit it
The say its prolific, lets be specific
Can I kick it, yes I can
You rocking with fifty fifty and Timbaland
We are not the same nigga now understand
I do what I want boy, you do what you can

Everythings going according to plan, no more
Con-sign-ment, no more hand to hand
My new hustle bring millions in
Damn what a difference between now and then
Ha ha, you see it, you really believe it
When I done came up, and I ain't changed up
I’m in the house with the toaster yo
Things are going how they supposed to go

[Hook]

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
This is what you been missing
I’m back in position, I listen
Theres nobody better, you know I go hard for the cheddar
The drama I bring it, way, way better than I sing it
Gotta put in work to ring the bells, my name ringing
It’s murder on the dancefloor when my songs on
My competition just sit on the type of shit I’m on
We keep it going, til it, til it, til it break of dawn
I ain't the one that you should be fronting or faking on
Stunt if you want, my niggas will have your Jacob on
I’m so ghetto, they say I’m so gutta
I don’t dance, I be in the cut like “what up”
You know my style, know me, everywhere I go
I ain't gotta say a word man, they already know
I’m a no-nonsense nigga that flow
Annoying conversation if it ain't about dough
But if you tryna get it, I’m with it
I’m all in? for sho



[Intro:]
{*set to the Geto Boys' "Mind Playing Tricks on Me" instrumental*}
{.. it's worth noting it's also Isaac Hayes' "Hung Up On My Baby"}
{Also for some reason Yayo's cursing in this song is reversed out}

[Verse: Tony Yayo]
Mmm, yeah, uhh
Mind playing tricks on me man

It's a, regular day and a regular routine
'Til I hear this tragic news from about two fiends
Your man 50, just got popped 9 times
And I heard through the grapevines it's all cause he rhymes
In front of his grandma, I'm standin on the lawn
Wearin no Teflon, I wonder if he gone
I know in my heart I wanna cry
Havin thoughts in my mind is my man gon' die?
As I frantically run toward's 50 spot
I panicky peep like fifty cops
It was blue & whites, DT's and homicide
With yellow tape locked off on both sides
With four-fifth shells on the floor
And DT's ringin doorbells, goin door to door
Yo I'm stressed out, smokin bogie after bogie
Duckin the sarge cause the sarge fuckin know me
I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit
And we did about a buck cause Mary Mack I lit
At the time, I started thinkin back some shit
How we used to sling crack and stack our chips
With Kev, P-Low, Big Jewel the Kid
And my man 50 used to smack a bitch
And the good and the bad on the 1-3-4
And them hoes that we had on the Cash Money tour
Now I'm at the hospital, stop daydreamin
All I see is 5-5-1 and there's beefin
Baby moms is screamin, whole family grievin
But the word is, that my man's still breathin
I dropped to my knees and I thanked the Lord
And got a long shitlist all across the board
Motherf... {*ends*}



[50 Cent:] yeah

Bodies start droppin'

Niggas really don't want war
Talkin' and walkin'
You'll meet your coffin
Ain't no stoppin'
When the Glock get to poppin'
Bitch niggas runnin', screamin' and hollerin'
Want to see what its like when you get shot?

Check ya ho

Hate the game, but respect it though
Cock and blow

Otherwise the Tec will blow
In other words ya neck will know
What it feels to have a exit hole
Them guns will make a nigga dumb turn him into a vegetable
I ruined mines
Doin' lines
My little niggas usin' nines
Spittin' rhymes
But I flip a bird
Feelin' like i'm losin' time
Got to get it all

Been there, done, and did it all
And what I saw was niggas fall
Once the young whore get the call

[Hook]
Nigga try and come play me better come on your A game, ay mayne, ay

Witness this shit, niggas get hit, ay
Run when it spit, don't get hit by the AK
Take cover quick, niggas on that shit, ay
Come broad day they'll get at you with the AK

[Verse 1]
Niggas think they know me, I be on some other shit
My baby mama don't know me, I be with my other bitch
I blow a stack, I get it back, you keep in check, I get the gat
Then you wanna chitter-chat, now what kind of shit is that?
Strip club, shake it shake it, toss it up, make it rain
Semi tucked, I let it buck, I shoot the shit up out your gang
Find out who you're fuckin with cause I ain't for the sucker shit
Cut you like the cocaine, niggas stay in your lane

113th Precinct ain't enough to stop us
Niggas shot at me before, I got away, popped from a block away
Sucker niggas be right there on one foot 'til I rock away
Next day I popped up told niggas it's my turf
They done seen the gun smoke, they done found my shells burn
Sabrina baby special, they treat me like a misfit
I squeeze I risk it, I risk it
Different class of nigga, my hand around the trigger
Don't make me do it, I'll do it, you stupid nigga

[Hook]

If shit pop off

Cut one of them niggas
Poke one of them niggas
Beg For Mercy number 4

First lp 10 million sold I'm so good
I thought niggas would love to see me shine
But it's makin them sick
To see me gettin mines
Got that Benz, got that Bentley and the new Bugatti
Got the Range after partin wit the new Ferrari
If it's makin you sick
To see me blow I'm sorry
Dude we used to be cool
But I ain't stuck wit you nigga
I grew up wit you nigga
But I don't fuck wit you nigga
Got shot in the back
Den turned around and got shot in the eye
Labels 2Pac lay down and die
There's a message in my music can you hear it God?
The mans never gonna blow
Another reason why
This disease infested
When I spit it any nigga can get it
Punks frontin' in they rhymes
That ass'll be flatlined
"can't we all just get along we used to be friends?"
Nah, fuck that man
We used to pretend
These niggas is comedians
I thought I was tight funny
5 called tellin "niggas mugged me"
Bet on my new surreal shit
Would you bail a nigga out son
If you niggas knew he was tryin to kill you
And wouldn't let you hold a gun?
Think about it
Haha ha!

Outro:
Aw man
I'm havin too much fun with this rap shit man
I love this shit man



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yo!
Bay Area!
You are now rockin'
With Big Von
And 50 Cent

Yo!
Southside. Roll something, smoke something nigga yeah
I fall off then I bounce back
I'm incredible, yeah

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
6-2 to the O, back to the '62 here we go
It's like every time I get on some niggas try to jam me
I grind, I go hard for my niggas try to jam me
I'm strapped now movin' round with the swammy
Got a baby by your baby mama, nigga we family
Niggas mad at the kid 'cuz I'm caked up
Yeah they want that pinky ring, yeah they want that Jacob
Sleeping Beauty tell me when you gon' wake up
You'll never have me hog-tied
You'll never have me jake'd up
I'm holdin'
Motherfucker I'm strizzapped
I'm rollin with the mizzack
I'll lay your ass flizzat
You wanna talk? Talk to me
You wanna be dead?
It's boom bye-bye to a body boy yeah
I had a dream I was broke, and woke up rich
It used to be the other way around, ain't that some shit?
I had a pistol under my pillow, a pistol next to my kicks
A pistol on my night stand, a pistol next to my bitch
I seen bullets on the couch
I seen bullets by the TV
Woke up feeling like niggas can't see me
Ask Em and Dre they'll tell you now I'm on some different shit
'Cuz i got a different tech, and they got a different clip
Yeah I got money now, every day a different whip
Different bracelet, different trip, shut your fucking lips
Don't be a rat
There's nothing worse than that

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah
It's the return of the heartless monster
I already know what time it is
And you already know what time it is
I'll shake the motherfucking town up
Niggas already said, they said "if 50 can't do numbers, then the numbers can't be done"
Huh?
I should give y'all niggas a whole R&B record
808's and my hearts broken, motherfuckers
I'm just a different breed of nigga, huh?
Niggas is faggots man
I don't like none of these niggas, man
Come around, niggas got them rainbow colors on
Y'all niggas confused?
Niggas from the hood ain't supposed to wear no retro shit
I'mma tell my little niggas to start kicking your fucking ass
See you out there with that funny shit on
'Look him, he's a faggot, kick him, kick his fucking ass'
[Laughs]



[Hook]
It's a natural progression
First you cut a nigga then you gun-butt a nigga
Then you pull the trigger, put that work in, put that work in
Make it hot, it die down do that shit again

[Verse 1]
You know my aunt killed my dog and never said sorry
Niggas broke in my crib and they stole my Atari
Man, niggas could've asked, I would've let 'em hold a cartridge
I wasn't fucking with nobody, see how niggas start shit
Instead selling crack I could've been Tiger Woods
But they ain't got no fucking golf courses in the hood
I said I'm selling dope, I don't regret shit
I'm selling dope, nigga, that good shit
I was supposed to be an A student, a valedictorian
Instead I'm in special ED trying to fuck, I'm horny
They didn't like my style, they said they didn't like my style
Them same bitches want me now
In came the cash, out with the cocaine
Virgin Mary medallion hanging off my rope chain
Four finger ring, nigga doing his thing
You get a couple bitches after you get the bling

[Hook]



[Chorus: 50 Cent]
The walls have ears lil' nigga, I run New York
Even when I ain't there lil' nigga, I run New York
I said the walls have ears lil' nigga, I hear when you talk
Let's get this shit clear lil' nigga, I run New York

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I wake up, stare at the ceilin'
I'm alive, what a beautiful feelin'
I put my vest on right after I put on my drawers
It's a habit I'm always prepared for war
See my life's like some shit, you seen in a flick
Bitches act like pornstars when they sit on a dick
When I was hit and out the game I said "one more flick"
Test my aim in the range I'm like "one more clip"
It's my brain, I'm insane, I be on some shit
Man I run Interscope, Jada's tryna annoy me
Nuthin' but another disgruntled employee
He been in the game ten years and he still ain't rich
Even his mama upset that he still ain't shit
And he keep runnin his yap, like I'ma take all that
One more word out his mouth I'll push Style's shit back
See the nozzle on my tre pound is three inches long
And the trigger on the fo' fo's extremly strong
With a little tre douche is like pop, pop
Chase his ass up the block til his bitch ass drop
And the verses he be kickin' none of 'em hot
Cos he ain't got none of that shit he says he got
And he ain't did none of that shit he said he did
And I ain't got time to be talkin 'bout this shit, (fuckin' faggot)

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I guess it's easy to see lil' nigga, I run New York
Yeah I live in CT lil' nigga, but I run New York
And I don't go to parties lil' nigga, but I run New York
And I stay gettin cheese lil' nigga, cos I run New York
(Yayo, tell 'em I run New York)

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
My gun is longer than yours, nigga, call your recouster
LOX made more money than them thin tiny suits
The game around south, drugs and rappin
Jada fuckin punchlines, my serp went platinum
Style's and Sheek Louch went double plastic
Yayo, Buck and Banks was puttin out classics
A hundred shots, a hundred clips, y'all ready to die
Fat Joe ain't a gangsta, he scared to fly
Automatic mossberg, who want a piece of this punk
I had Ja Rule buryed in some high heel punk
Feds stuck in a bullet-proof, man fuck that
Homie, shoot up my whip, you only leave a scratch
Yo, I slip cocaine, in your hotel lobby
And beat you wit my pistol like Caine did Chauncey
It's T.O.N.Y.Y.A.Y.O.,
My whole clique, gotto,my Os on the fly hole
C4s, we fly on linz
And my rocks lookin like, Flex likes yo' benz

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
When I'm down in DC lil' nigga, I tell 'em, I run New York
When I'm out in Philly lil' homie, I run New York
When I'm in VA I tell niggas guess what, I run New York
I'm in NC niggas holla at the moon, cos I run New York
(Yayo tell 'em I run New York)

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Now who the fuck told that lil' nigga he can talk to me like that? Catch my bottle up and roll him somewhere, [laughing] D.Y. wanna talk to me, wanna tell
Me what's goin on. Want me to serve him somethin' for real, cos I'll serve, murder [laughing] eh, eh get Puffy on the phone, tell him I said, tell the
Nigga I said get out the mil for a second let me talk to him. Puffy da only nigga a muthafucka pops, tell him I won't buy the nigga Jadakiss pokes. Nigga
Still ain't a coupe. Ah, nigga, you in da way. You owe money nigga, aw man, now why you make me put yo' business in da street. Now niggas know you ain't
Shit, damn! I see yo' punk ass in da paper, cos you ain't returnin them jewels you borrowed, you better give 'em back, you dirty nigga. Ain't none of that
Shit you be wearin yours. [laughing] We coulda kept this secret, nigga. These niggas I'm supposed to beef wit. Aw man, this fight is fixed, you been set
Up, [laughing] that's what he gonna say, "they set me up, man." I ain't even go through that

This is how I'm feeling right now, I mean I'm.. I'm blessed

[Hook]
Me, I ain't got to send a usher around with baskets or talk to a choir
But nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on sunday morning
Me, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get by
But bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service on sunday morning

[Verse 1]
I make so many mistakes, so many corrections
I'm so far from perfect, so many imperfections
But I'm a go getta, I get up and go get it
So if you're preaching prosperity, I wanna hear it
I make the hood look good, turn the base into base line
Punch lines to white lines, run from the one time
My verse is like a graphic scene, close your eyes
Now you seen the dope fiend lean
And you seen the pimp pimp hoes
The 4-4 blow and niggas puff dro
Like there's no tomorrow
Hit that pass that, that's the motto
You know jail's like vacation for my friends
They go away, come home and do the same shit again
You think I'm bad, man they don't give a fuck
They trying do what they gotta do to get a buck

[Hook]
Me, I ain't got to send a usher around with baskets or talk to a choir
But nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on sunday morning
Me, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get by
But bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service on sunday morning

[Verse 2]
I take the line out the good book an eye for an eye
Shoot me I shoot you back, I don't care if you die
First the sun comes down, then the sun goes up
And the coke price too when the D's make a bust
It's freeze nigga, get the fuck on the wall and
Everything you worked for, they come to take it all
Man it's like they don't know what they taking
Hit you with the tazer, I'll have you sizzling like bacon
When you pray say a prayer for me, a nigga could use it
Through my pain there's a piece of me in all of my music
Go head you can judge me, I'm hoping you love me
I see I got it mastered, muh muh muh magic
Hocus pocus keep the bitches focused
Before we pop up on that ass with toasters
Lord forgive me I'm regressing again
Forgive me for that line and the rest of my sins

[Hook]
Me, I ain't got to send a usher around with baskets or talk to a choir
But nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on sunday morning
Me, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get by
But bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service on sunday morning



[Verse]
One-two, one-two, testing, I said one-two
One-two, one-two, ya'll niggas know just how I do
Let's get more paper, more bread
It grindtime, I ain't fucking 'round, kid
Got a new case, D's ain't got no proof
Got a new coupe, it ain't got no roof
Test me, see if I won't shoot
I'll cock that and bang that quick for the loot
Trey deuce, got it stashed in the booth
If there's a problem I get to the roof
Go 'head get your ass shot then Q
You talk too much, boy, I'll put you on mute
Even me would need more than a vest
And more than one strap I guess
You got me all fucked up
I might just get your whole clique stuck up
Then come back and sell you your shit back
I'm known for grimey shit like that
Ask around, niggas know me good
South Side, nigga, this my hood

[Hook]
Well, if you're leaving then leave
On your way out leave my keys
Well, if you're leaving then leave
If you're leaving then leave
Well, if you're leaving then leave
Get to walking and leave my V

[Interlude]
So happy, huh?
Yeah, what happened, girl?
What's happening?
Come on, yeah, come on, come on

[Hook]

[Interlude]
So sorry, I'm sorry

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ho, calm down, baby
You're overreacting
Oh, I got y'all back in Bentley's

Quit lying to me

You know you my first baby
You're not gonna go away
Sit your ass down right here
It's 50, come on, bounce with me, come on
Just makes me feel good, man
Yeah, next level shit
Uh uh uh, come on
Well, if you're leaving then leave
You want me to be your man
You know you need me, girl
I don't know why you're acting the way you're acting
You love me, let me hear you say you love me
Oh, now you don't wanna say it cause everybody listening
Oh, you full of shit, man, it's cool, it's cool
You love me later, you love me long time



I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
Two niggas in the front, two niggas in the back
That's four niggas riding strapped in grandpa's Cadillac
The voice in my head say fuck all these niggas
Then I start thinking, I should rob all these niggas
Man my homies they want do whatever I want do
I say I want eat this and shit we want eat too
Let's ride around find a nigga stunting on first street
With the shine's on niggas be looking like lunch meat
I run up on a nigga, pop one on the floor
Tell um come up off that shit 'fore we start popping some more
Fuck a ski mask, man niggas know who I is
I got a full clip and niggas know I get biz
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
I'm up early in the morning, tryna make a move
You coming in here with me shorty take your lil' one to school
Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma
I hit her with the lama to get this cake
Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
Oh, she don't know it, damn, okay we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
With a gun to her head saying, "Daddy come home"
You was rolling, popping bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearing you
And the nine will jam, right in my hand
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
I got his homies screaming buck you need to calm down
Niggas be getting killed every time you come around
We ran up in his crib made his momma kiss the ground
She asking God, what my baby dunn did now?
I'm taking every thang, jewelry I want it all
Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waiting we can starting waiting on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fucking sidewalk
And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga lef'
G-Unit soldier I'm thugging till my death mothafuckas
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed



[Intro]
I don't wanna hear no complaining
Cause you niggas already know how I get man
You niggas cannot punk 'round here
What the fuck, you think it's different cause it's music?
Nah, man, fuck that, man

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes, see the shooters, see the money in the bag
See the D's in the unmarked on a nigga ass
See '62 on the plate when niggas bag up
Scrape the plate, my nigga, everything add up
I'm hungry like I've been missing a meal
Back writing like I need me a deal, I show you the steel
It's a jux, nigga, feel the chill
Up your spine, I'm a menace for real, I blast to kill
Leave your brains on the dash and wheel
Mix the kush with the hash and chill, let's talk bread
Them niggas in the way of the money, let's shoot their head
The rest of them suckers have scattered, it don't matter
I try to get my head right, I boogie like my head lights
Big Benz, big friends, bitch, get in
I blow twenty on the chain, ten at the dice game
We used to be the same, now we not alike, mane

[Hook: Gina Thompson](50 Cent)
The things you do makes me keep running to you
(Run to me now, baby, come on, run to me now, baby, come on)

[Verse 2]
I like my bitches fast just like the Porsche's
Switch gears, ride at like 500 horses
You're now rocking with the boss of the bosses
My wrist glist so sick I leave a nigga nauseous
That's the Hublot, what's that you got?
I rock that on Monday, you'll have that one day
Follow my footsteps, you know I move proper
So what you got a chopper? Nigga, I got a chopper
Mines ain't got no wheels, what's the deal?
Propellor's propel, I'm on the top of New York
Top of the food chain, nigga, talking my talk
Success is my addiction, you should take a hit of this
I'm down for the friction, you start it I'll finish it
Victim? Pick 'em - knife work, stick 'em
Chrome Colt, pop 'em - hollowtip, drop 'em
It won't be long 'fore you're going dying now, watch 'em

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, after the drought it's the flood
It's strategic, man, I planned it
Now follow my footsteps, you know I move proper
Let me inspire you, let me make you wanna win
Let's take it to the top, baby
I wanna say something that'll make you hungry
Don't let nobody fuck up your vibe, man
Coming in with that negative bullshit, we don't wanna hear it
How they gon' stop a hustler from hustling?
Man, 'till next time, 50



[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Ain't it amazing, how crazy, the hood done made me
Feels like my emotions are froze
I stay G'd Up
Its the things that I seen
And the shit I've been through that made my heart turn cold
I stay G'd Up
I'm a gangsta ya find out fo' sho' if you ever step on my toes
I stay G'd Up
When I'm hangin' out tha window with that AK
Fillin ya punk ass with holes
I stay G'd Up

[50 Cent]

Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, marijuana
Mule on that Greyhound from the N-Y to the Carolinas
Paper chase, different name
Same face, don't catch a case
My road dog's on parole
His baby gurls 4 years old
We play tha block, pistol cocked
You could shoot or get shot
Kill u for ur crack spot
Take everything your ass got
Semi-automatic spray
Bust back or run away
Niggas talkin in tha hood
We'll handle his another day
In November, you make my shitlist
You did, you can cancel christmas
I'll send you a gift
Niggas will come and leave yo' ass twisted
Dem hollowtip shells burn baby burn
As a nigga get murked, a babies born and tha world turns
I seen it all crystal clear
So I keep my pistol near
Hearts never full of fear
Homie I stay well aware
Of what's goin around me, muthafuckas want me dead
I go with a smile on my face, when it's my time kid

[Chorus]
Lil nigga I dun paved the way, y'all should thank 'em
But if u think otherwise bring ya boy over here so i could spank 'em
I'll put a end to your career bitch (bitch)
Before you speak on 50, buy .40 and a spare clip
These niggas gassed up
Gettin too used to rap
Like I won't give them more blood clots than supercat
Niggas'll snatch ya
I'm like a backcatcher (nigga)
I'll give a sign and they'll throw sumthin at ya
Round here niggas die off hydro
And even when it ain't 4th of July it sound like pyro
I'm smart enuff to creep and lay your dumb brains down
The pound (will) spin u around like tha young James Brown (yeah)
I know im hot but hey (hey)
I'm icy too
Rocks will hit u from a block away
Like a beat from Dr.Dre
We takin' over this year
K's and the soldiers is here
Everyone knows that your scared (yeah)!

[Chorus]
[Young Buck]
My popa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
He just pop another bottle n smoke up a half a gram
I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night
They gave my homeboy life
So when you do it do it right
My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
I still got tha heart to go and bust me a head or two (fo sho)
No other solution
You think we hollerin n hootin'
Until you wake up (buck!)
Then you gotta here about these shootings
I take a pull from a loose one
And put tha clip in my pocket
Before I take another bullet I'm gonna pull it and pop it (bllaaatt)
And if it's beef my nigga
Then let your guns do ya talkin'
The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin (haha)
They say we responsible for boostin tha crime rate
They say that we da reason why these young niggas buying weight
But im gonna keep this Glock on my waist till my dyin'day
Its "Nuttin But A G Thang" G-Unit And Dr.Dre

[Chorus]

She a freak, my-my London, girl
It's not another bitch like her in the whole wide world
Hey, Tony (what, bruh?) I think I'm in love
This bitch licked all over my ass-crack (uh!)
From the window she went to the wall
From the tip of the dick to the ball
I mean the freakiest shit, she do it all
Went from RedTube, Tube8 then YouPorn
I told her Lil' Kim said it: "take it in the butt
I'm done, she did it, she's a badass what?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I left her on my bed, she was masturbating
She told me give it to her, quit procrastinating
She's just like me, this is fascinating
She's a freak, I'm a freak, isn't this unique?
We'll be fucking for an hour
I cuff her to the bed, I'm not a cop
I'm an outlaw, Billy The Kid
Roleplay all day
Staircase, hallway, rooftop
S-E-X non-stop
See the sceneary, same postition
My ghetto kamasutra's ill, now listen
She flexible, I make her do yoga
Twice a day I'm bending her over

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
I just came from the USA
Now I'm back in the UK
I just came from the USA
Now I'm back in the UK

Lean back with the AC blowin, cruise

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]

I'm the last to laugh, the first to blast
The AR fire so fast ya dead in a flash

This is the chrome on the 'Lac, this is paper to stack
This is shortie from ya dreams with the ass so fat
This is better than blow, it's better to know
50's that nigga fa sho, fuck with the blow, Slow down
This is the last chance to dance, the last chance for romance
The last, This is the last chance for me to get in your pants
Last chance for us to slide down
It's better than Bentleys it's better than Benz'
It's better than exotic cars when I'm up in it
It feels like Heaven, it's better I bet
It feels so good it's wetter than wet
That project pussy is oh so good
I better take my ass back to my hood
There's oh so much I've been missin', listen
Shortie you know how I do I'm comin thru

[Hook]

This little light of mine, I’m gon let it shine
Right under the barrell, I’m sure I won't miss
Say a prayer I don’t care, I’m here for the money
Pay dumb, get done, call it murder one
Six shots pop, hit a pop, bullets ricochet
Your catching hot, hell so far away
Cough up the cash before shit get really bad
You don’t really really wanna see a nigga when he mad

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm in that 6, 7 glass house
In and out of lanes
Murder on my mind
Old english runnin through my veins
I think about easy and it eases my pain
I drink a 40 ounce g unit soakin in the rain
I came into this world both feet in the dirt
No purple label no button up shirt
No harm intended no subliminal disses
But hard facts seperate the men from the bitches
I would popped your ass if I thought you was worthy
Lookin like boy george in that larry bird jersey

Hop off the G-4 lets have a boston tech party G-Unit

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

Fire your stylists you know dats wrong

Around here niggas get shot for performin that song
And hoes cut they eyebrows off and draw them back on
They try to merk me yo

Pop shit I stroke your s***
And soon as her mouth open up what?
Same color as coconut

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm so Sorry
You ain't from compton you ain't gotta flow like game

Nobody gonna miss you when the dessert eagle hits you

After battling with his major label for years, 50 Cent has decided to become an independent artist.

The rapper announced Thursday that he's leaving his longtime record label, Universal Music Group's Interscope Records, and Eminem's imprint, Shady/Aftermath.

The Grammy winner and his G-Unit Records have signed a distribution agreement with Caroline, the independent label at Capital Music Group. Capitol is one of the many labels that are part of Universal Music Group.

50 Cent launched an ultra-successful, six-times platinum debut with "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" in 2003, when he burst on the music scene with Eminem as his mentor. His sophomore album, 2005's "The Massacre" was almost as successful, but other albums didn't match his previous efforts and he expressed his unhappiness with his label. 50 Cent had been planning to release a fifth album on the label, but it was set with multiple release dates and singles, and eventfully didn't see a release.

His last album was 2009's "Before I Self Destruct," which also had several release dates.

"I have had great success to date with Shady/Aftermath/Interscope and I'd like to thank Eminem and Dr. Dre for giving me an incredible opportunity," 50 Cent said in a statement. "I've learned so much from them through the years. I am excited to enter this new era where I can carry out my creative vision."

50 Cent had a plethora of hits early in his career that dominated the pop, rap and R&B charts, from "P.I.M.P." to "Candy Shop" to the anthemic "In da Club," which introduced the young rapper aside Dr. Dre and Eminem.

"Both myself and Shady Records are grateful to have had the chance to play a part in 50's career," Eminem said in a statement. "Shady simply would not be what it is without 50 Cent. I've developed a great friendship with 50 over the years, and that's not going to change. We know 50 will have success in his new situation, and we remain supporters of both him and G-Unit."

The rapper, born Curtis Jackson, has also been a success outside of music, from film roles to fashion to books.

50 Cent's new album, "Animal Ambition," will be released June 3. Caroline has recently distributed albums by Korn and rapper E-40.

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
From NY to Compton real respect real
One hand on the wheel, one hand on the steel
Roll that, pass that, cock that, blast that
Flip that, flash that, I'm always where the cash at
That's why I'm in a nigga crib screaming where the stash at
Nigga come up with the chips and get hit
This is that beretta bounce, that full clip sound
That six shot revolver dance, now spin around

[Verse 1: 50 cent]
I'm on a hard bench, tryna' sleep in a holding pen
Man, how the fuck did I get here again?
First thing in a morning, it‘s the fuck shit
They called the case, I got confronted by a tough snitch
He told me do it, 1 click, you ain't tell me to do it
You ain't a shooter, you a shermhead, you fuckin' loser
I fly a kite, my little man cut his sister up
He loves his bitch, you snatch her, he'll start switching up
I'm cool, I just wait ‘til my next court date
I bet he catch amnesia, then do this shit at leisure
Surrounded by Bloods, Crips, Kings, and Ñetas
Gemstars open niggas up like barettas
I'm tryna' be easy
But every now and then I gotta put it in, please believe me
You get to looking at me strange, I'm prepared Jack
A buck fifty, keep the change you can wear that

My blade'll turn a line man into a feather weight
Who me? I wanna warn you motherfuckers ain't seen nothing like me
Still looking for a juxs and my wrist so icy

Half man half dog man my niggas sense fear
Brought 'em here in a Lear to take your Audemere

[Hook:]

I'm a play, we gonna spar from now to the fight
You understand how this goes down right?
You seen this movie before, this a rerun
'Fore what we call it? We call it Get Rich Or Die Trying
Huh, D12 niggas that time
Nah nah nah, we call it the massacre
We did 10 million that time
What we gonna call it?
Huh

[50 Talkin`]
Listen man
Everybody know me know
I don?t forget nuthin`
If you kicked sand on me in the sandbox when we was kids
Imma catch you and kick your fuckin` ass for that now
HaHa! !



[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I ever go broke, I'ma kick in your door, waving the four
Screaming "Get the fuck on the floor, and gimme the raw!"
Listen, killing rap niggas wasn't part of the plan
It's the way these niggas talk man, they forcing my hand
I'm the same over beats, as I am on the streets
If I have to, I'll kill a motherfucker to eat
I got gats, clips, chips, whips
Bricks to flip, and a flow that's sick
My rhyming time is precise like I'm doing the heist, I'm nice
Get out of line and you'll get sacrificed like Christ
Look at these fake playa niggas fronting like they macking
Drop the "m" off of macking, then you have it they acting
In Queens we got lil' niggas running around packing
Not little guns, this shit is bigger than Pun
Let me find out you thinking about thumping with me
The pussy club on your nine won't rump with me

[Verse 2: Nature]
Now that Martin Luther King know his time was short, being pro-black
Turn the other cheek, nigga hold that
It's gain my niggas respect, it's V-I-O-
L-E-N-C-E is what I be when I see my foes
It's automatic, anytime, anywhere, grizzly bears
Shots going off, kids get scared
I go from Queensbridge to park slow. Across the world
Leaving trails of hoes that got they heart broke
I puff the dark smoke, usually, mix it with greens, look what it do to me:
Have me fucked up before puberty
If I had one wish and the shit'll come true
A nigga live to be a hundred and two
All I need is a two-pay, call it a new day
Immigrant prostitutes like "papa how much you pay?"
Got to lose weight, niggas say I'm way too big
Bad habits, call a shop, and stay way too jigg, motherfucker



[Verse 1]
Imagine I was broke right now
Saying damn, where my friends go
Cat burgler style, I'm coming through your window
Bitch I'm so focused, nigga I'm so focused
Slim chance I'ma go back to killing roaches
Be quiet, you can hear the rats in the wall
Make you want to pump crack til you stack racks
The dope bring the dough in, shawn sister, she hoeing
Like Brenda with her baby, she six months, she showing
For 50 should suck that, for a buck you could fuck that
And you thinking she nasty, but niggas is nasty
Dice game shake em up, praying for a six
The wolves out there hungry, they looking for a lick
Sun down to sun up, they looking for a come up
10-30 in progress right in your projects
They boosting, you like Gucci, they got it
Spot it, and every other high end product
I put you on, my man's man, got a credit card scam
Come through later, I'ma plug you in fam
Niggas pissed on the staircase in an elevator
Now I'm pissed cause I'm starting to smell like this player
My little man get bread, I tell you what he doing
He bag up for days till cocaine in his urine
His momma got bills he avoiding the eviction
He play lookout and warn niggas when the dicks coming

[Hook]
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker

[Verse 2]
Mikey put his foot to a bitch ass on some pimp shit
10 hoes, 10 g's a night, niggas getting rich
Any nigga get out of line, I got 'em
Southside across my back, I'm from the bottom
All a nigga need is a block and a connect
And a box of 9mm's to load in the tech
The beef all gravy, a nigga half crazy
You pull it, better bang it
Cause niggas will bring it
That kush moving faster than crack, nigga its burning
Now move a couple pounds of that, now you're earning
Stack paper on every flip, get the whip
Than get a new bitch and forget the one you with
She said she could do bad all by her damn self
Nigga let her do bad all by her damn self
A bitch'll tell when the pigs come
Won't even try to make bail when the pigs come
Just let her do her own thing

[Hook]



[Verse 1: 50 cent]
I'm on a hard bench trying to sleep in the holding pen
Man, how the fuck did I get here again?
First thing in a morning, it‘s the fuck shit
They called the case, I got confronted by a tough snitch
You told me do it, don't act like you ain't told me do it
You ain't a shooter, you a shermhead, you fucking loser
I fly the kite, my little man'll cut his sister up
He loves his bitch, you snatch her he'll start switching up
I'm cool, I just wait ‘til my next court date
I better catch amnesia then do this shit at leisure
Surrounded by Bloods, Crips, Kings, and Ñetas
Gemstars open niggas up like Berettas
I'm trying to be easy
But every now and then I gotta put it in, please believe me
You get to looking at me strange, I'm prepared, Jack
A buck fifty, keep the change, you can wear that

[Hook]
This is murder, this is not music
I had your style 10 years ago, I just didn't use it
You niggas forgot how I do it
Well, I do it like there's nothing to it

[verse 2: Arny]
I'm tryna come up they want me to lose again
I ain't confused flashback im on my moves again
Situations get ugly you can see the real friends
Stab you in the back whilst you stuck in the pen
Diabolical i’m satans angel with the weapon
You want me to be the bad guy i guess i am then
No point doing good when i got a black heart
Well i guess i'm gonna use the shells of the mac as darts
Sincere life is not clear from the start
Call me the paper boy chasing dreams god plz dont tear em apart
Have i got there or am i there yet i say that i should believe
No one loves you they figure out you were there all along when they grief
I separated as a child called myself an outcast because of my teeth, I knew i was sharp a  different species predator on the gully streets
Happiness suppose to surround you not when you're walking in my feet, I’m still striving for success i want to achieve until i reach defeat
Get at me uh



[50 Cent]
Next and 50
(Uh-huh)
Next and 50
Next and 50
Next and 50

Yo, yo my imagination is more vivid than life
Playboy November issue page three was my wife
I ain't never had a problem with going for dough
I did a Jordan in the box I grew it myself
I go up and down like a merry go round
Visions of some...splash
I touch on myself when ain't no shorties to touch me
After this joint half the hood gon' want to fuck me

[R.L.]
I can imagine you're here
In your Vicky panties and brassier yeah
It's like your sexy moans I hear
Got a player gettin' wet down there, I swear

Me on top you on top even from the rear yeah
Call in sick to work
Can't get worse, damn I'm a jerk

1 - [Next]
I'm all alone and I'm trippin' my girl
I keep on missin
Got me fiendin' for the kitten
I call but she don't listen
I make the decision to handle my own business
Back and forth with the rhythm
Till I make the jizm
I'm a jerk

[R.L.]
I e-mailed you, tried the cell too
Tried to contact you
But I failed too
Pants swelled too
What should I do?
Touch myself?
When I thought about you

[50 Cent]
Yo, yo at the end of the road
Home sick than being sick of home
I'd rather have a short to help me
Then do it on my own
Check me out I'd rather beat my own dick than trick
That's a quote from BIG I take it back ya dig?
I play the block to get my work off
D's come I murk off
Do a bid for rape fuck that I'd rather jerk off
Listen time's money so I'm only into quickies
I'm not a pretty boy so I ain't never been picky
I make it real easy for you to bop to this
Man I pop the Cris and I rock the wrist
New CL 500 I'mma cop this shit
It only come hard top so I'mma chop this shit
Ballers they don't chase chicks they chase chips
Champagne you take sips they guzzle the shit
Only a selected few can rock to this
Kaygee, 50 Cent, Next, ya stoppin' this?

Repeat 1 (2x)

Loving me like me
Especially when wife be acting funny
Cause it don't need for no money
And it can be so lovely
Take your hand and aim to please
Don't drip a drip on your Dungarees
Take a towel and cover your jeans
Move it back and forth till you see babies

Repeat 1 (2x)

I'm a jerk, if your a jerk
How do it work?
Show me how you move it back and forth now baby
For the guys and the girls
Move it all around now work, oh yeah

(Chorus)
'Little mama show me how you move it
Go head-putcha back into it
Do your thing like there ain't nothin' to it
Shake, shh shh shake that ass girl
'Little mama show me how you move it
Go head-putcha back into it
Do your thing like there ain't nothin' to it
Shake, shh shh shake that ass girl

(Chorus)
Let's party, everybody stand up
Everybody put ya hands up

Get my drink on then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance all I do is this

Listen pimpin' I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy, I teach how to do this shit

And a little' Hennessy, you know we 'finna carry on
Hollerin' at this bitch in da club tryin' to get right
We gonna be up in this bitch 'til we break daylight

(Chorus)

You see me rollin, you know I'm holdin, I'm about my paper (yeah)
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin', I'll embed it in ya brain, I'm off the chain (G-Unit!)
Next level now, turn it up a notch

Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, ok let's go

(Chorus)



[Intro]
Nigga I ain't fucking around
SMS, get the message, get the message!
SMS, get the message!

[Verse 1]
I go hard full time, duck when I pull mine
I run from one time, fuck a pig, ya dig?
I go to war with one nine
I work, you see mine
But I ain't never ever gonna say I did it
In a hoopty, hoody on, cruising the back locks
You stuntin' on hungry niggas, go ahead get your ass shot
Your neck got your chain on it
Bullet got your name on it
I'm serious, sometimes it seems like I'm playin'
Dump a shell case in your face, The D's got 40?
They tryna find a rat or call it a cold case
I know some niggas, some snitches
I know some bitches who's scared
I got some shooters around me and they stay fully prepared
We got them straps you niggas look at and flinch
Ghetto nigga get rich, what you think I'ma get?
We got that pump in that chopper, we got the tech in that sweeper
We got that Ruger that Mac, I call it my bitch nigga ether

[Chorus: x2]
All we do is get that grain
And my niggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang
I'm talking 'bout the Unit gang

[Verse 2]
Inhale! Smell the gunpowder, my hands is full of residue
Niggas'll shoot niggas, you lucky it weren't you
Nigga, my best song, my chucks are bomb proof
You shoot, I shoot back, find God when I'm on you
This ain't tales of the crypt, nigga, this tales of the hood
Stay the fuck out the way with your mouth shut like you should!
When the bullshit start I'mma find a spot
Aim it right at your knot than the shell cases'll drop
Man, you niggas don't know me, you know my government name
Go 'head ask about booboo, they tell you I let it bang
Got a big reputation, there's something wrong with my brain
Nigga front, I'mma squeeze it, go 'head stunt, I'm squeeze it

[Chorus: x2]
[Outro]
Yeah! Back on my shit, man!
I don't give a fuck about fitting in
You niggas gonna follow me!
Back to the ground, nigga we gonna make it nice and dirty!
Now wan' get dirty with me?

R.I.P NATE DOGG



Intro
I love niggas! I love niggas!
Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!!)
I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again)
And to all niggas that do it I love

[B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (You niggas understand?!)
To all my Bronx (It's war nigga)
To all my Queensbridge (I'll blow you away)

[Verse 1: B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's a real nigga for ya

[Chorus: 50 Cent] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Verse 2: B.I.G.]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the ruler

[Chorus] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hail the Henny
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people feel your awkward
I tame I'm not lame
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo punk ass off propa'
This new place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged you know, bump my shit, bitch!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!
